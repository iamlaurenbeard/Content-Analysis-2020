"@@42792 Everybody asks why I started at the end and worked back to the beginning . The reason is simple . I couldn't understand the beginning until I had reached the end . There were too many pieces of the puzzle missing . Too much she would never tell . I could sell these things . People want to buy them . But I 'd set all this on fire first . She 'd like that . That's what she would do . She 'd make it just to burn it . I couldn't afford this one , but the beginning deserved something special . But how do I show that nothing , not a taste not a smell , not even the color of the sky has ever been as clear and sharp as it was when I belonged to her . I don't know how to express that being with someone so dangerous was the last time that I felt safe . The Santa Anas blew in hot from the desert that fall . Only the oleanders thrived . Maybe the wind was the reason my mother did what she did . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shadow then . She was the most beautiful woman I 'd ever seen . Everybody thinks that when they're small but she was the most beautiful woman most people had ever seen . He came into our lives without warning . She ignored him at first . He wasn't her type . We laughed about him , his persistence . "" Never let a man spend the night , "" she said . Never apologize , never explain . She was breaking all her rules . And it would change everything . What are you doing up here ? Come sit next to me . It's the best place to feel the wind . I can feel it from here . No , you can't . It's okay . You should get some sleep . I never sleep . I've been up here for hours . I had the most amazing idea for how to use my Polaroids in the Newport show . I'm gon na skip work today . Keep going until I finish . You're still coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I forgot . I made plans to go to Greta's opening . All the other parents go . What can they tell me about you that I don't already know ? Time's up ! Pencils down . Papers , please . Thank you . Thank you . Time , Astrid . Thank you . Is your mother coming tonight ? No . She has other plans . More important than parents ' night ? She's an artist . She doesn't care about things like parents ' night . Right . And don't forget , you guys , chapters 17 and 18 for tomorrow . Finished my mug shots . What do you think ? They're great . No . You're not looking . You can't be an artist if you don't see . Why do you think they're great ? I don't know . They're lonely . It's me in the center . It's our secret . You can't tell anybody . I won't . I never tell our secrets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long has this been going on ? - Couple months . - His wife's gon na figure it out . - She's an idiot . Cinema Scene . It's Barry Kolker again . Tell him I was killed in a climbing accident in the Himalayas . Barry , she's still out of town . We don't have any eggs . We never have any eggs . Barry can take us out to breakfast . Barry spent the night ? Yeah . Excuse me . I bet he's still out of town . I called the magazine . He got back three days ago . He's probably working . He doesn't call then . He doesn't call when he's getting what he wants from somebody else . I don't think you should do this . He'll get mad . - I'll just say we were in the neighborhood . - He won't believe us . You're not my type . You're not my type . What happened ? He has a date . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he has a date . - No ! Get away from me . - Get her out ! - You have no right ! - You're under arrest ... - ... for the murder of Barry Kolker . - They can't keep me ! I'll be back in an hour ! You must be Astrid ? I'm Miss Martinez from Children's Services to pick you up . If you need more time , I can give you 15 minutes , but that's it . I'm not going . I'm waiting for my mother to come home . Your mother won't be coming home . At least not for a while . ... any legal cause why sentence of judgment should not now be imposed ? Therefore , in accordance with the laws of California I sentence you to the term prescribed by law for murder . Not less than 35 years to life in a maximum-security prison . - Hey ! - Hello , Starr . How are you ? Well , I'm fine ! How are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y'all must be starving . I hope you like olive loaf . - I made enough to feed an army . - Astrid ? - How was traffic ? - Bad downtown ... - ... but it cleared up pretty fast . - Oh , good . There you go . Astrid Magnussen , this is Starr Thomas . It is so nice to meet you , Astrid . Come on in ! Here , let me help you with that . Was it a long drive ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? I hope you didn't bring a ton of stuff . You'll share a room with my daughter . This is our home . This is where we have company . Then in here is the kitchen and whatnot . The boys sleep here . We don't have enough bedrooms . That's Davey in the glasses , and Owen . This is Astrid . Boys , you say hi ? Carolee ? I said , get out here right now . Let's just go in there . This is Carolee , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you'll sleep . She'll clean up . Don't worry . Just don't mind her . She's hormonal . The problem is she hasn't been saved . What about you ? What ? Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior ? I don't know . When you do , he'll be waiting . Okay ? This is where Ray and I sleep , and the bathroom's here . Let's go back in here . Ray's home late tonight . It's poker night . Don't talk to him about Jesus . He acts like he's the repo man or something , not a carpenter like him . You must be the new addition . I'm Ray . Or Uncle Ray , but that's Starr's idea . Not mine . I'm Astrid . It's nice to meet you , Astrid . You coming in ? Well , how come ? I'm thinking . Oh , what about ? My mother . Starr was telling me about her . She's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , those things happen . You come in when you're ready , okay ? That slut said I was grounded , like she's the mother in The Brady Bunch . Listen to that . Saved by Jesus . She's such a hypocrite . They shouldn't be doing it . They're not even married . Reverend Daniels always blah-blahing about Jesus . All he really wants to do is look at her ass . Don't forget to leave the window open . Don't look at me like that . You're no different than I am . You just don't know it yet . I'm gon na kill you , Ingrid ! I'm gon na strangle you , bitch ! You bloody bitch ! Sin is a virus . That's what Reverend Thomas says . It's infecting the whole country like the clap . We've got every excuse . What's wrong if I shovel coke up my nose or want to feel good ? Who does it hurt ? Well , it hurts us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know how you swallow that . "" He who believeth in me , though he was dead , yet will he live . "" Don't forget it . Here we are . It's a miracle I'm not dead . They took my kids away . I was an alcoholic ... - ... a cokehead . I was dancing topless . - People are staring . Oh , Astrid , look ! Look at that . That is gon na go perfect with your new shoes . I mean , I thought : "" Who cares if I hang my tits in a stranger's face ? It's nobody's business . "" You know what ? This is gon na be good on you . Astrid , those are ugly shoes . Snakes don't bite above the ankle . You're better off being bitten by snakes than dressing for them . We need to get her a bra . Carolee had her first bra when she was 9 . You don't want them hanging to your knees when you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that ? Look at that . That is so nice ! Hurry , Astrid , it's here ! I told you you were gon na miss it . Astrid . This one's for you . Who's it from ? My mother . I didn't think she knew where I was . Dear Astrid , have you been getting my letters ? It's been six months . Why don't you write ? It's only a few minutes before they turn out the lights . I can hear the women screaming in their cells . We're both in prison , you and I , punished for our strength and our independence . Don't forget who you are . The best part of me is well-hidden and you have to do the same . Remember it all , every insult , every tear . What are you doing ? I'm writing a letter to my mother . You ever write your dad ? I don't know where he is . I never met him . He left when I was 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No . - Well , aren't you curious ? - I think about what he would think of me . He probably thinks you're still 2 . That's how I remember my son , Seth . - You have a son ? - Yeah . - Hey , Ray . - Hey , Patty . So you're going to the Jesus show ? - Aren't you coming ? - To Bible study ? No . In my opinion , if there's a God , he sure as hell ain't worth praying to . That sounds like something my mother would say . She wouldn't take me to the Christmas pageant . She made me beg a ride off another kid . Hey , Ray . Leanne , hi ! How you doing , Reverend ? I don't think he likes me very much . Why don't you and Starr get married ? ' Cause I'm already married . - Astrid , come on in . We're starting . - Okay , I'm coming . Where's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her or my son in over five years . I baptize you in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit . Amen . Do you believe in God now ? Maybe it's not such a bad thing to believe in something . - It's better to know things . - Why ? What does it get you ? Does it tell you the difference between right or wrong ? She didn't kill that guy alone . I knew what my mother was doing , you know ? I could've saved his life , but I didn't . Come on . I'm gon na kill you , Ingrid ! Open the door ! Think there was something valuable on that hard disk ? Maybe a collection of essays due at the publisher's this fall . You bloody bitch ! You can't do this to me ! You don't know what I can do . Fill out your registration slips . Know your inmate's number . No number , no visit . Hey , baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , no , no , no . Don't cry . We're not like that . We're the Vikings . Remember ? You're so beautiful . Prison agrees with me . There's no hypocrisy here . Kill or be killed , and everybody knows it . Do they hurt you ? Not as much as I hurt them . I won't be in here forever . I promise you that . One day you'll look out your window and I'll be there . Your hair smells like clover . I wan na remember you just like this , in that sadly hopeful pink dress . - Starr picked it out . - Of course she did . What's that ? Nothing . It's just a cross . I know it's a cross . Why are you wearing it ? It's a present from Starr . She force you to go to church ? They're really nice people . It's called the Assembly of God . To join you have to accept Christ as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being washed in the blood of the Lamb . But really , it's just water . Have you accepted Christ as your personal savior ? - There's nothing wrong with Christians . - Are you out of your mind ? How did this happen ? I raised you , not Bible-thumping trailer trash . I raised you to think for yourself . No , you didn't . You raised me to think like you . Maybe thinking for yourself isn't so great . Reverend Daniels says it's evil . Evil ? If thinking for yourself is evil , then every artist is evil . Is that what you believe , now that you're washed in the blood of the Lamb ? - Man's ability to reason is evil ? Am I evil ? - No . No . But killing people who don't want you is evil . We pray for your redemption . Fuck my redemption . I don't want it . I regret nothing . Attention . Visiting hours are over . Visitors , return to the holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify evil , Astrid . But evil is tricky . Just when you think you know what it is , it changes its form . Learning its nature takes a lifetime of study . I will not lose you . Not to them . Those people are the enemy , Astrid . - Visiting hours are over . - Write to me . - Time's up . - Write to me ... - ... at least once a week . - I love you . I'm the only person you know who can keep you honest . - Okay ? - Okay . Don't forget who you are , Astrid . You're my daughter and you're perfect , remember ? How far away is it ? About a mile . Maybe two . Shouldn't we pack up and go ? No , not yet . The wind's still in our favor . My mother used to love fire season . She made me decide what I 'd take if we had to go . She said if I was brave , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . What am I like ? You ? You're a sweetheart . Astrid , honey ? Astrid ? You come on in here a minute ? Well , sit down . I won't bite . You having fun here , aren't you ? Making yourself at home , getting comfortable ? Little too comfortable , I 'd say . I might not be a genius , but I get your game . And it takes one to know one . - One what ? - Always hanging around handling his tools . "" What's this for , Ray ? Can I help you ? "" We're not doing anything . I'm calling Children's Services . - It's all over . - But ... Don't "" but "" me . He is a man . And he sees what he sees , and he does what he can . I've got a nice thing going here . Ray's the best man I ever had . And I've lived too long and come too far to blow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I've got myself and my kids to worry about . We hardly know each other . I don't owe you a thing . - Jesus would give me a chance . - Well , I'm not Jesus . Not even close . He might be mad if he knew you sent me away because you were jealous . You're trying to make him a prisoner . He's gon na hate you . What do you know ? I know that men don't like women who try to own them . I like you . I like the kids . I would never do anything to screw it up . You swear you're not interested in him ? I swear to God . - There . Did you see it ? - I'm not sure . - See anything yet ? - It's just starting . But we should be getting 40 an hour soon . The Quadrantid is the shortest meteorite shower , but the densest . Except for the Perseids . You and Starr , you having a beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it's hard getting older pretty girl coming up in the house . Ray , honey ? What are you doing out here ? Nothing , baby . Just having a smoke . Looking at the stars . And this is $40 , not even $40 a month . - Forty dollars is $40 . - You waste $200 in one night . - You've been doing it weekly . - I won last week . What else are you doing with the money , Ray ? - You can't even look at me . - I'm looking right at you . You weren't . And you've got your car out there . God knows what you spend on that . That comes out of my pocket . - Don't ruin this . - Ruin what ? You didn't come in till 3:00 in the morning . - I was with John . - She's drinking again . And who else ? I saw you eyeing her . Thought you all were going to a movie . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing poker ? - The game got cancelled . - They coming home soon ? - Not too long . Well , there's plenty of food if you want . Thanks . This isn't right . Is everyone gone ? - It is my business ! This is my house ! - It is not ! - Get out of my room ! - You abide by the laws I put down ! I am not gon na get out ! I waited up for you . I want to know who you were with ! Don't give me your shit . You stayed up to drink . - I stayed up to catch you , you whore ! - You should know . Try it again , I'll take you out , bitch . Carolee ! You walk out that door , don't you bother coming back . Why the hell would I want to ? I've been down this road with you before , Mom . Sorry , Davey . I can't go through this again . Carolee . You used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admit it , bastard ! - You're screwing her ! - You need to call your sponsor . - Screw my sponsor ! - Go back to bed . I should've gotten rid of her . Know what I'm gon na do ? I'm gon na go in there and cash her check . Hey , Starr . Starr . Hey ! Starr ! Give me that gun . - What the hell is wrong with you ? - Get off ! Starr ! Starr ! Get off of me , goddamn it ! Get off of me ! No , Ray ! Goddamn it , Ray . Get off of me ! No , don't cry . We're not like that . We're the Vikings , remember ? Astrid ? Can you talk to me ? Astrid ? Astrid ? Can you talk to me ? Astrid . Talk to me . Can you talk to me ? She's coming around . This boy saved your life . If he hadn't called 911 ... - ... you 'd be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Who shot you ? - I don't know . Hey , watch your feet . - Okay , rug . - Got it . - Where's Ray , Davey ? - He's gone . They're both gone . I'm sorry . I'm so sorry I ruined it . Doesn't matter . Something would have . Bye , Astrid . Okay . One step . - Davey . - We got you , Astrid . Okay , step . We got her . It's okay . We got you . We 'd prefer to find a permanent place , but we have so many children right now . You need special attention , which you'll get at McKinney Hall . They have all sorts of activities for kids . You're dead , bitch ! You hear me ? You're dead . Don't ever look at my boyfriend again . You hear me ? You look at my boyfriend , you're dead ! Next time you and your friends jump me , I'll cut your throats when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I was looking at your picture . It's good . Who is it ? - How come you chopped off your hair ? - None of your business . - You're still beautiful . - Looks don't interest me . That's easy for you to say . You've never been ugly . Look . It's the puta . She's so ugly now . You're not ugly . You write as if you're surprised to find me still beautiful even here . Our beauty is our power , our strength . We can't allow them to change us , to lessen us . I will never grant them that satisfaction and neither should you . So is this your first time in Mac ? Figured . You're so unfriendly . - Life's easier without friends . - Maybe . I like it here . It's better than being in a foster home . It's the floor you can't fall below . - What's that ? - A letter . - From who ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In prison . For murder . - And your father ? - Don't know the guy . How about you ? They were junkies . She OD 'd when I was 6 . He disappeared a couple years later . - I was born addicted to heroin . - Really ? What was that like ? I don't know . I was out of rehab by the time I was six months old . So ... - What's the deal ? Are you gay ? - What ? I don't know . I get this feeling from you , like you're not interested in guys . You're right . I'm not . You think that's funny ? I'm sick of this . I'm not gon na let you do this again . Why don't you shut up ? You're not even in this . - Cut it out . - She does this shit . I'll beat your ass . Wait until we get off the van . - Back off . - I'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - They 'd put us in McKinney Hall . - Hurry . - Come on . Come on , come on . The guy's a genius . I started out copying his stuff , but no ... I could never touch him . He's great . But you're better . You're insane . No , I'm not . I mean , he's a great cartoonist , but you're an artist . What's the difference ? Well , that's like asking why a joke is funny . Either it's funny or it's not . You're either an artist or you're not . You are . It's hard because they keep moving . That's good . Don't look . I'm not done . - There's another one . Do you see it ? - Yeah . The Lyrids shower is visible most of the night . The brightest star is Vega . But you can't look right at it or you'll miss the fainter meteors . You can trace them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A kid I used to know . I used to have a foster home right over there . It's nice living on the beach . Do you ever think about your father ? Not really . He was an asshole . I think about mine sometimes . That when I'm an artist he'll read about me in the papers and he'll want to meet me . I'm not gay . I know that . I'll show you the one that he did of me . It's right here . They're not bad , for what they are . For what they are ? What are they ? Cartoons . No , they're not . They're so much more than that . I mean , he's really talented . - Don't do it again , Astrid . - Do what ? Attach yourself to anyone who shows you the least bit of attention because you're lonely . Loneliness is the human condition . No one is ever going to fill that space . The best you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't let the cattle get in the way . You're not talking about me . You're talking about yourself . Sometimes I get the feeling you don't even want me to be happy . Why wouldn't I want you to be happy ? - Where are they sending you ? - I don't know . Look . The comic book store will hold letters for me . Wherever they take you , keep checking there . Why do we have to go to Mexico to buy this stuff ? It isn't FDA approved . - What's it called ? - DMSO . - What's it for ? - All sorts of things . You'll like these people . She's an actress and he does something with television . - Do they have any kids ? - No . They're looking to adopt . She's had an incredibly hard time . She's very smart . She's just missed a lot of school . - You don't have to decide immediately . - Okay . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , just let me know . There you are . I'm really sorry Mark couldn't be here to meet you . He's filming in Nova Scotia . Well , this is it . I left it plain on purpose because I thought that way , you know , you could put your own things up . - I like the D ? rer watercolor . - You know who D ? rer is ? - My mother's an artist . - Oh , that's right . Of course . Of course . They said that . Hey , listen . Do you want some tea or something ? Or Pepsi . I bought Pepsi . I didn't know what you 'd drink . We have juice . I could make you a smoothie , if you like . Would you like a smoothie ? Tea is fine . Okay . I look , I look . Stop . Look ... And now I die . - You were really good . - Do you know what a nightmare it is ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready drag yourself to this audition . They look at you for two seconds and tell you that you're too ethnic , or too classic , too something . Too ethnic ? It means brunette . And too classic means old . And too small , breasts . - Why do you do it , then ? - What ? Give up show business ? Come on ! - Well , here . To your first run at the beach . - Never again . - How's your shoulder ? You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , it's fine . No , you did really well . You did really , really well . What was the best day of your life ? Today . - What should we do later ? - I don't know . What do you want to do ? Swim ? Okay . Oh , my God ! He's back early . Mark . Hey . Hi . You must be Astrid . It took us three hours to get him back . The whole film crew's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he thought it was gon na come back and finish him off . - What would you have done if it had ? - Ducked . Come on . Okay , here we go . Perfect . Just , just right there . Thanks . - Well , cheers . - Cheers . Cheers , Astrid . So we've got some catching up to do . Claire tells me you're quite an artist . - Not really ... - She's wonderful . In fact , Tricia Day accepted Astrid for one of her watercolor classes . - At the museum ? - She loves Astrid's work . You should show him . They're really , really beautiful . She's never even studied . She's self-taught . Is that right ? Is she all right ? - I know you're perfect . - I'm not perfect . Of course you are . You're my daughter . Hey . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Just thinking . - Are you getting my letters ? - Yes . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why doesn't she have any children ? She can't have them . You dress like her now . She takes me shopping . What's her husband like ? He's nice . He's gone a lot . So you spend most of your time with Claire ? Yeah . I 'd like to meet her . Why ? Because you don't want me to . Who did this belong to ? That was my great aunt's on my father's side . She was a field nurse at Ypres . Very , very brave woman . It's pretty , isn't it ? - And whose was this ? - It was my mother's . My father gave it to her . My parents were completely inseparable . Not at all like Mark and I . I hate it when he has to go away for so long . - Why don't you go with him ? - He says it slows him down . - I think it's because he's having an affair . - He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . If he did , I would never know about it . You're just being paranoid . Yeah , that's what he says . That can be very negative . - Should I put this here ? - Yeah , perfect . Everything ready inside ? - You're leaving tomorrow ? - In the morning . I bet Claire would love to go with you . Coordinating our schedules is difficult . She's not working . I mean , she could fit into yours . What about you ? Doesn't she need to be here for you ? Yeah . How is she these days , when I'm gone ? She okay ? She's fine . - Why do you ask ? - No reason . You're back early . How long has my mother been writing you ? Not long . We've only written to each other a couple of times . - Why didn't you tell me ? - She asked me not to . Well , she thought that you wouldn't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . And God , she's talented . We 'd like to meet . Whose idea was that ? Mine . I bet . - You know , I really love your work . - What have you seen ? Astrid showed me the collages and some of your earlier work in the catalogues . Oh , I love the Polaroid installation . Really ? Why ? I don't know . Well , because ... Well , because it's great . - I'm actually very visual myself . - A kindred spirit . It must be difficult for you to work here . It is . I spend so much time fighting off sexual advances I hardly have time to think . That was a joke . - Jailbird humor is hard to get sometimes . - Sorry . So , you're an actress . - So glamorous . - No , my career is a disaster . I think it's the process . It , you know , may be too painful for me . You're such a sensitive person , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your self-esteem . I'm a typical Pisces , but that's why Astrid and I get on so well . Scorpio and Pisces understand each other . You're into astrology ? She's not into astrology just because she knows our signs . Astrid and I used to understand each other . But she's become so secretive . Astrid isn't secretive at all . We talk about everything , all the time . We just love her . She's doing so well . She's on the honor roll and we're just working to keep that old grade point average up . Put a pyramid over her desk . It improves memory . - My memory's fine . - A pyramid ? I hadn't thought of that . I do practice feng shui , though . You never mentioned that in your letters . How about your husband ? Is he into feng shui as well ? No , he's into frequent flier miles . He's gone half the time . That's not so bad , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great comfort to you not being able to have children of your own . Yeah . Yeah . She is . Would you mind letting us talk alone , sweetie ? Grown-up things . - Don't we have to go ? - No , it's okay . We have time . Love humiliates you . Hatred cradles you . It's soothing . What did you say to her ? She's having trouble with her husband . It's not you , is it ? I know you have an attraction for older men . No , it's not me . - You leave her alone . - But it's such fun . Easy , but fun . In my present situation I have to get fun where I can . God , how can you stand to live with poor Claire ? Did you know there's an entire order called the Poor Clares ? She is a genuinely nice person . You don't know what it's been like . - lf you love me , you'll help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the worst kind of foster hell than living with that woman . What can you possibly learn from her ? How to pine artistically ? Twenty-seven names for tears ? All I can say is keep your bags packed . I don't feel like it . I'm a stranger in my own house . You live here and I stay here once in a while . - Maybe if you gave a little bit . - I give . Why can't I give to her , why can't I be here ? - Because I work ! Because I have a job . - That's not fair . I give you everything you ask for and it's not enough . No , not everything . Not everything . You promised things would change . - Mark , I'm trying , you know I'm trying . - Trying's not good enough . You're falling apart . We are back to where we started . It is not working out and I think we should send her back . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go ? - They'll find someplace . You're gon na send her away ? You take everything away , don't you ? - You just leave me with nothing . - Jesus Christ , you are such a bad actress . I really almost forgot . Okay , okay . All right , I'll send her back , okay ? We can try that . Just don't go , okay ? Just don't leave me . Unlike you , Claire , I work . Remember ? And she going with you , your girlfriend ? I've had it with this , Claire . I've really had it . Astrid ? Astrid . Astrid , please . Claire ? Are you awake ? I'm sorry . Are you all right ? Yeah . Take my advice . Stay away from broken people . You can't send me back . He's not coming back , Astrid . He's gon na divorce me . You know , Claire , it wouldn't be the worst thing . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Come on . Okay . Stay with me , okay ?

I live in a cell with a woman who has a vocabulary of 25 words . Why do you think they got you ? To create a perfect family ? People get babies for that .

You've got nothing to lose but Visa card , Happy Meal , and Kotex with wings . Christ , Thursday . - Hey , lazy cows , you want smoke ? - I quit for the baby , Rena . Why ? You don't keep it , thank God . Hey , you , cheerleader . You want smoke ? Russian cigarettes . No cancer . Clothes . - That really is a nice color . - It's gorgeous . - What's it made of ? - I don't know . Why don't you just try it on and see how you look ? - It's really nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dress . These are all mine . So ? You get good price for them . What do you need expensive clothes for ? - Melrose Place call you to be a star ? - Someone gave them to me . Even better . All profit . That's why I love this country . Because it loves money like I love money . - Hey . You make a price , I take 25%%. - No . What , you think you're gon na sell it all by yourself ? I pay for stall , storage , gas . They pay you , you pay me . You still make profit . Hey . Dead person who give you thing don't care . The past is gone . Sentimental is stupid . It's smart to make money . There's no price .

She's our project in Women's Studies . - What does she want ? - She didn't send us . We came on our own . She asked us to mail you the interview , her show at Bergamot . We thought we could deliver it and see if maybe ... - Is that it ? - Yeah . Excuse me . - What do you talk about ? - All kinds of things . Art , music ... She talks about you . Really ? What does she say ? Well , that you're in a ... You know , fostered . Look , she feels really terrible about what's happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adopt me ? You don't think she killed him , do you ? Something you should know . She did . I was there . Oleander's poisonous . I don't know why people grow it . - Open the door ! - How dare you ? You have no right ! They can't keep me .

Your mother said you 'd be difficult . - Mother knows best . - You've been through a terrible ordeal . Three foster homes , the shooting , the suicide of a foster mother . I understand you were close . Did you ask your client about her involvement with that ? You can't blame her for the death of a woman she met once . But I do blame her , Susan . That's pretty cynical , Astrid . You want me to lie for her in court , is that it ? Why do you hate her , Astrid ? Because you think she committed murder ? Or because you feel abandoned ? Talk to her . People do change . You should hear the way she talks about you . She worries about you . She asked me to find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car ? There's money behind her . Just tell me what you want . You are stupid girl . You walk away from money to punish mother . You want car ? You want art college ? All costs money . You don't know anything about this , Rena , so just stay out of it . - I have plan for you , anyway . - Yeah ? What's that ? Niki leave soon . And Yvonne is stupid girl . Making third baby . Every time she look at the window to see baby's face , baby gone . Then she cries like it's a big surprise . But you , you're a special girl . You stay , I make you partner . Stay here ? What , you got better place to go ? Then go see mother . She need something from you , you need something from her . Go get it . Here she comes . Astrid , my God ! What's wrong , Mom ? You don't like my outfit ? I'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s the story ? We didn't go to Mexico to buy DMSO ? Barry beat you ? He raped me ? How bad does he have to be to get you out of jail ? I can't believe what's happened to you . When I get out , I'll make it up . Who said you're getting out ? I said I 'd talk to you . I didn't say I 'd do it . Then what do you want ? I have a deal to make . A trade . You tell me the truth , I'll lie for you in court . - The truth about what ? - Everything you kept from me . - And if I don't ? - Then you can rot in here . I hate this look , by the way . You're a Sunset Boulevard motel , a $20 hooker in the back of a car . Why did you murder Barry ? If I submit to this , you'll testify ? Yes . Self-defense . He was killing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her ? Claire went after herself . I just showed her how to do it . Who was my father ? Why do you always ask that ? It's ancient history . It's my ancient history . Who was he ? His name was Klaus Anders . - What 'd he do ? - He was an artist . How did you meet ? At Venice Beach , at a party . He had the drugs . Did you love him ? It was a long time ago . I'm not the same person . Liar . You're exactly the same . Answer the question . You're such a child , taking my propaganda for truth . So set me straight . Did you love him ? We had a very sexual relationship . One overlooks many things . You worshipped him . I read it in your journal . "" Worship "" isn't exactly the word we're looking for here . Who is Annie ? What ? Who is Annie , Mother ? She was a neighbor who took in kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like ? - Dark , curly hair , freckles . Did she take care of me ? How can you possibly have remembered this ? It will only hurt you . Imagine my life for a moment . How unprepared I was to be the mother of a small child . I was used to having time to think and you just wanted , wanted , wanted . I felt like a hostage . Can you understand how desperate I was ? I dropped you off at her house one afternoon to go to the beach with some friends . And one thing led to another . They had a place in Ensenada . It was wonderful . You can't imagine . To take a nap in the afternoon to make love all day if I wanted and not have to think : What's Astrid doing ? Where's Astrid ? Mommy , Mommy clinging to me like a spider . At the end , I just wanted to throw you against a wall . How long were you gone ? About a year . Give or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You're not asking the right question . Don't ask me why I left . Ask me why I came back . You should've been sterilized . I could've left you there but I didn't . Don't you understand ? For once , I did the right thing . When I came back , you knew me . You were sitting by the door . You looked up and you reached for me . It was as if you 'd been waiting for me all along . I was always waiting for you . That's the constant in my life . Waiting for you . Will you come back ? Will you forget that you tied me up in front of a store or left me on a bus ? - Are you still waiting ? - No . I stopped when Claire showed me what it felt like to be loved . What did you think ? That I would amuse you ? That's what babies are like , Mother . Did you think we 'd talk about Joseph Brodsky ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam and Eve in a vine-covered shack . I was crazy . - You were in love with him . - I was , all right ? I was in love with him , baby makes three and all that crap . Then why did you leave him ? - Why did you leave him ? - I didn't leave him . He left me . You wan na know about your father ? He left us when you were six months old for another woman . I never saw him again until he came looking for you when you were 8 . - He came to see me ? - Yes , he did . But it was too late . Why should I let him see you after what he did to me ? It wasn't about you ! It was about me and I wanted to see him ! My whole life I've wanted to see him . That decision was mine , not yours ! Everything's always been about you , never about me . I knew you were gon na kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn't give a damn about what that would do to me . I'll say whatever Susan wants , but I got ta go . You don't just walk away from me . I made you . I'm in your blood . You don't go anywhere until I let you go . Then let me go . You look at me and you don't like what you see . But this is the price , Mother . The price of belonging to you . If I could , I 'd take it all back . I would . Then tell me you don't want me to testify . Tell me you don't want me like this . Tell me you would sacrifice the rest of your life to have me back the way I was . Listen , forget it . A deal's a deal . Let's just leave it at that . Excuse me . It's probably a waste of time but I'm looking for someone who used to come here . His name's Paul Trout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd turn up . Thanks . - What's going on ? - I don't know . - Excuse me . Is it a recess ? - No . Jury's out . Don't you need me to testify ? Your mother told me to leave you alone . What happened ? She let me go . Two years after Paul and I moved to New York I received a letter from my mother . In it was the Los Angeles Times Magazine , my mother on the cover . A Santa Monica gallery had mounted a showing of her work . The Times included seven pages of her hauntingly distant prison collages . She stares out from the cover , the bars of her cell behind her . Beautiful . Dangerous . Proud . The Times said she was close to winning a retrial after a first failed appeal . They called her show a triumph . It's too much to imagine her tempering her joy with a moment of grief a moment for what that triumph had cost . These suitcases are a map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so I find myself thinking of her wanting to feel that wind . It's a secret wanting like a song I can't stop humming or loving someone you can never have . No matter how much she's damaged me no matter how flawed she is I know my mother loves me . [ENGLISH]

Sofia beat on Harpo . Then Harpo beat on Sofia . And then , Sofia beat on Harpo some more . In between the beatings , the children keep coming . And then one day , Sofia can't take it no more .

Nobody can get to them . Butter , butter , butter . It's in the cooler , on the shelf . Butter ? Butter ! In the cooler , on the shelf . Albert . How do you work this stove ? Ain't hot enough . Can't even keep a stove burning good all day . She can't even keep her oven hot ! You're useless sometimes ! Wood . Wood . Did you ever cook on this ? It still ain't hot enough ! I'll get it hot . I'll show you how to make it ... hot . Baby , look what I brought you . Have I got a surprise for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the eggs are the way you like them . Are you trying to kill me ?

What is it with this Shug Avery ? She black as tar nappy-headed ... . She got legs like baseball bats . Her own daddy won't have nothing to do with her . Old Mister talking trash about Shug . Folks don't like nobody being too proud or too free . She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel . She ain't even clean . I hear she's got that nasty women's disease . You ain't got it in you to understand . I love Shug Avery . Always have , always will . Should've married her when I had a chance . And throwed your life away . And a right smart amount of my money with it . I hear all her children's got different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Shug's children got the same daddy . I can vouch -- You can vouch for nothing ! Shug Avery done set the population of Hartwell County a new high . You just one of the roosters , boy . You has my sympathy . Ain't many women's allow their husband's whore to lay up in their house . Hand Pa his hat . Next time , I'll put a little Shug Avery pee in his glass and see how he like that . I ain't heard so much racket since before Sofia left .

On my first sight of the Africa coast something struck in my soul , like a large bell . Ijust vibrated . It has been a long time since I had time to write , but always no matter what I'm doing , I'm writing you . Dear -- Celie ! Bring me a cool drink . Olinka is four days march through the bush from the harbor . Do you know what ajungle is ? Trees and trees and more trees on top of that . They are so big , they look like they were built . And vines and ferns and animals and noises that make you wonder what is lurking behind the shadows of every bush . We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of millet , porridge and fruit , then morning classes . We teach the children English , reading , writing history , geography , arithmetic and Bible stories . The older children are used to going to mission school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here screaming and kicking . They're all boys . Olivia's the only girl . There is a little African girl called Tashi . She plays with Olivia . "" Why can't Tashi come to school ? "" She asked me . I told her the Olinka don't believe in educating girls . She said , quick as a flash : "" Like white people at home who don't want black people to learn . "" She is sharp , Celie . When Tashi can get away from her chores she and Olivia hide in my hut . To Olivia right now , Tashi alone is Africa ... . Everything she learns , she shares with Tashi . Sound familiar ? At first , there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest . A kind of low humming . Then chopping and the sound of dragging . Then the scent . Some days there's smoke . Now , after two months during which I or the children or Corrine has been sick all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon class burst out as he entered : "" The road approaches ! "" Dear Celie , the white man is building a road . It reached the cassava fields nine months ago . The morning after the road was done , as far as Olinka was concerned what should we discover , but that the road builders were back . They have instructions to continue the road for another 30 miles and continue it right through the village of Olinka . The road builders didn't deviate an inch from the head man's plan . Every hut that lay in the road's path was leveled . Celie , our church , our school my hut all went down in a matter of hours . But the worst is yet to be told . Sweet Corrine ... died from fever and grief . We buried her in the Olinka way . But Celie , my dear sweet sister we'll all be coming home once we work something out with U.S . Immigration . They don't know if we're American , African , or missionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunset . What's with you ? I was calling you for an hour ! Now get my shave and don't keep me waiting ! - Where's Celie ? - Home fixing to shave Mister . You got a fever ? I didn't come here for you to take all day to shave me . Get the molasses out of your ass ! The longer I'm married to you , the slower and dumber you get . Your ass as slow as I ever seen it before . Celie ! Ain't that razor sharpened yet ? Get out here and do me right now ! Get out here ! All right . Put your head back . Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears . That razor looks dull to me , Miss Celie . Damn women .

If he hadn't been your boy he might have been a halfway decent man . Say what ? You took my sister Nettie away from me . You knew she was the only person in the world who loved me .

Smiling down on me ? ? You're smiling down on me ? Dear mom , did you ever wonder about the moment you became you ? I've been thinking about that lately . I mean , the moment that decides how we forever look at the world . I remember that moment perfectly . Mom , what are those ? For me , it was with you . They're picture frames . See in that one , a little boy's getting a bedtime story from his grandpa . Up there , they're putting up the Christmas tree . Boxes of light . Windows into life . Every frame begs me for a story . Uhhh ... You okay over there ? I don't know . I mean , I just don't , I feel like I'm flying blind . I don't know if the colors I'm using are right . I don't know . Well , if you're really nice you could ask for help . Really ? Sure , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this . Do you have one of those kits that they use on you ? Of course . I never leave home without it . I just got a new one yesterday . Kind of magical . It's basically the secret to my entire career is this little box . Almost anyone can use it , but no one knows about it . There's this really special red color . Comes in a little tiny box of eight . I could just paint that on you . Look at that . See you wouldn't have to do that . It would stay all day that crayon . Thank you . Thank you for that invaluable help . They just delivered our tree . Ha , really ? I hadn't noticed . Have you got your one yet ? Now why would a girl who lives alone need a tree ? You could put my present under it . But seriously though , like , I don't know , like , on video , is like , should I be wearing more blush . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gon na ... Look , I wouldn't worry about it . It's face time . I mean , you're basically just going to be a frozen image . Like an Emoji . Smile Emoji , sad Emoji , raise the roof Emoji . Your bras are going to raise the roof . Is there a bra Emoji ? Why didn't they send a real crew though , you know ? Like they do for me ? Okay , I've got an idea . You can do it , right ? - I mean you love my bras . - I do . You just talk about how much you love them . Girls around the country will want you to love their bras . It'll work really well . Problem is the only thing I can describe is how to take them off . - Mm , are you ready ? - No ! Stop it . Stop it . Oh , not that ready . Okay , do I look okay ? Is it ... seriously . Just ... hold on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! - No , no , no . - You look fine . Okay , okay . Hey , guys . Joining us live from her stunning home in New York City to talk about her new haute couture bra line that is tearing up the runways , ladies and gentlemen is ... Georgina Scott . Georgina , welcome . Gosh , you look phenomenal and I can't even see your bra . Well , thank you . You sure know what to say to a girl . Thank you so much . I'm really excited to talk to you guys . My goodness , what is going on ? Fashion week has been all abuzz about your bras . Who knew there was so much new to do with boob support ? Well , never underestimate a woman's love of dressing up , even when she's undressed . Now , I thought we had seen it all with Victoria's secret and their diamond bras . Tell us , what has everyone so excited ? Well , look , I'm a gal who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amazing works of art , but I wanted to create something that every woman could buy and own and have that same wow factor in their own bedroom . We use hand-printed silks . We use antique lace , uh , vintage Czech crystals . I wanted to sort of do a tip of hat to the most beautiful and ethereal styles of the past that inspired me all my life . I've never seen bras made of this fabric or design . They're so sophisticated , like you can wear them in the street . I think that every piece of clothing that goes on your body should be as beautiful as possible . Not just functional , but infused with the art of fashion . Now , speaking of fashion and supermodels , you are dating the absolutely resplendent Sebastian . The iconic face of Bateau Cologne . So , we're guessing , Georgina , that he's probably your first Guinea pig , am I right ? Um , let's just say that he's supportive of my work and leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies get our hands on these ? Well , all gals and maybe some guys can get their hands on them , uh , starting tomorrow on fifth Avenue and this weekend across the nation . Georgina Scott , always a pleasure . Congrats on your success , and look , I know now what my wife is getting for her birthday . The pleasure was all mine . Thank you so much you guys . Coming up , a revealing new interview with Russell Crowe . You won't want to ... Whew ! So ... Well , that was amazing . Yay ! Well , they did all the heavy lifting , but more importantly , how 'd I look ? Like every man was fantasizing about what bra you were wearing ? You're blowing up . Oh ... Becca , the service is over and we're back at the house now . Everyone's asking for you . Please come . I know you're upset . I , we didn't get a chance to finish . I need to explain , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scott , I hope you haven't been waiting too long . Georgina , please . Couture has decided to do a feature on your spring line in our may issue , featuring a June bride theme . How do you feel about that ? I think that's fantastic news , oh my god . Thank you so much . Good , well we're all very excited about it over here . In fact , I have a fan who 'd very much like to meet you . Hello Ms . Scott . It is such a pleasure to meet you . I attended your show during fashion week and I just wanted to say that I thought it was so incredible . Thank you . You know , you look familiar . Do we know each other somehow ? Oh , um , the pig and cow building . - Of course . - I live there , too . Wow , what a small world , right ? Oh , so nice to meet you . Bye ! Do you have any children , Georgina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Well , it's impossible not to mess up , even when you do everything right . Nah , looks like you did everything right . Anyway , send me your sketches as soon as you can and we'll see what we can do to do a gorgeous splashy layout . That sounds perfect . Thank you so much . ? I don't ask for too much ? ? you can't keep up , you can't keep up , you can't keep up ? ? and up ? Becca , come on . We've got the reading of the will tomorrow . I ... will you just let me know you're okay ? Can you call us ? Alright , I love you . Bye . Hello ? Hi ? I'm home . What are you doing ? Hey ! Just finishing up some work . What are you doing ? Just gon na cook you some dinner . What are you doing ? Hi . We can't afford any of this stuff . Oh , no this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new recipes . My god , Kevin . Who cares about new recipes ? Well this thing is gon na rise or fall because of the recipes . That's cute , that's really cute . Why don't you keep punning your way into bankruptcy and we are going to have to go and live , you know , with your grandma in Newark . Would you please stop worrying so much ? I'm sure we're going to get a call from the loan guy really soon . Be able to set up that nice little space in Soho - we talked about . - Who are we kidding ? You are a straight guy who wants to sell pastries in lower Manhattan ? That doesn't exactly sound like a slam dunk . And meanwhile , we're almost all the way through our savings and you're creating new recipes ? I hardly think a few hundred dollars worth of truffle oil is going to put us over the edge . Well that's the point ! It's not just a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . I can understand why you're nervous . You don't understand ! Because I am the person who has to work an actual job while you get to just smell and taste your way into this fantasy world . You know this wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I stormed out of my parents ' house to be with you . I wanted to stay that vibrant , irreverent person . And now I'm policing your groceries ? I mean god damn it , Kevin , I really want to start our adult life together , and you just made me into the person who has to clean everything up . Rigby ! Quinn . - Hey . - Hi . What's all this ? Uh , the vinyl towers . It's a set I built for you . Oh , you're a carpenter , too ? Well , lucky for us then . What the hell is it ? Well , it was from an interview that I read of yours , where you said you related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' 60s , ' 70s vinyl . More analog than digital . So it's kind of throwback , but all you . - Alright . - Okay . Come on . Thank you . Head down . Turn to the left . ? She ain't walking to the city , to the city for somehow ? Good ! Yes ! Wait ! ? Give me fire , give me water ? Good . Yes ! Hey , Becca , where are you ? I know you're confused and hurt . And I am too . I'm here . I know it makes you feel good , but you do know that weed is a carcinogen , right ? Hey , cool , ' cause that's what what worries me most right now . Thanks . Don't you hate smelling like a frat house when you go to work ? Sorry you have to see me lower myself to stoner status . There's a picture of you on Quinn's site from the concert . You should check it out , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will never hear the end of it from my mother . Too late . Your parents probably have your apartment wired with hidden cameras anyway . She's going to lose your mind when she finds out where you're working . Please . She would never be caught dead south of 63rd street . Downtown might as well be another country to her . Besides , don't you want people to see how cool you look ? I do look pretty cool . See ? Hi . Yeah , I'm fine . Yes , that's me . Told you . Uh huh . Got the tickets at work . Shh ! What ? T-that's not a guy , mom . That's Tricia Williams . Yeah , my roommate from Andover . Remember ? We're on facetime . I've got ta go . Yeah , she's having some personal problems and I'm helping her out with some stuff . Well , good of you to help out an old friend . So where did she end up ? Rutgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good waste of prep school education . Stop it , mother . She got into Yale early decision , same school that waitlisted me . - Yes . - Not everyone can afford Ivy . But you are a Princeton grad , in the entry program of Wells and Kinney . Yes , you know what , I did graduate from Princeton , where I magically made it off the wait list , and I did magically get into the most competitive entree program in all of Manhattan . I have to go , mom . But the markets are closed ! Look , I thought maybe we could hang out a little bit and , you know , I 'd like to hear all about what's going on . Nope , still working . I'm making a delivery for one of the partners . Delivery ? Yeah . That's how they break us in . Can you believe the bastards ? I got ta catch the subway . I'm gon na lose you . Why don't you take a cab or , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey . - Okay ? - Yeah . Tony ? Tony ! Will you set the table please ? Dinner time . Every time . Did you hear from Becca today ? What do you think ? I think it's time for me to call her . Don't . She's mad at me . She's gon na be just as mad at me when she finds out the truth . You know , this isn't just happening to you . I know that , Peter . I don't know what to do . Maybe we should just let her process things and come to us when she's ready . How is she gon na process it if she doesn't know everything is what I'm saying . Well she's not gon na talk to you either . Maybe . Tony , how do you feel about leaving your aunt Becca a message ? She's not my aunt Becca . - Come on . - You guys are liars . You lied to her and you lied to me . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wouldn't all be living a total and complete lie . Don't talk to your mother that way . I can't believe how weak you guys are . You lied . You could've just told us the truth . Oh yeah ? You have no idea what you're talking about . You're right , dad . I don't know what I'm talking about because you never tell me anything . No , no . Let him be . Let him be . Early birthday present . What ? Wan na look ? Yes ! What is it ? Is that Times Square ? But not just Times Square , this is gon na be everywhere . What you did on that shoot was magical . You really captured him . Quinn and his team wants your images to define him from now on . Across the planet . And Quinn wants to hire you . - No . - Mhm . Really ? Why ? For what ? Well , um , for some more shoots obviously , but uh , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , um , I don't wan na , you know , rain on your parade , but um ... My ex and I we tried to give it another shot for the boy's sake . You have a son ? And I thought you hated your ex . Hate is a strong word . You said , I hate my ex . Well ... I hated the fact that I had to get married with her because she was , you know ... Right . But Hal is here now , and I need to be a decent dad . I'm sorry . Oh ! The truth is , you stole my thunder . I was gon na dump you , but then you come in here with this great news and now I can't be mad at you . Phew ! Well , I got ta go . K . Bye . Oh . - Bye . - K . - Hey . - What are you doing ? Can't sleep . Me too . Milk ? No , thanks . Oh my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some c-span actually . Well , better than milk . Hey . Hi , Pete . Hey . Thank you for calling . You okay ? Yeah , I just uh ... I don't know how I'm supposed to feel right now . Mad , confused , sad . Million questions . Everything I guess . Yeah , I guess that sums it up . Um ... Beth doesn't know I'm calling you , but ... Oh , please . I can't . I can't talk to her right now . - I just ... - I know , but ... Do not defend her . Jesus . She had thirty-three years to tell me this and she , she waits until my mother's funeral to tell me that the woman I'm grieving is not my mother , who is my grandmother . And she's not my sister , she's my mother . I-I ... It's a lot to take in , huh ? I can't . I don't know how to wrap my head around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve wrapped my head around it for a long time . Yeah , I was uh , I was wondering if you knew . If you knew this whole time and you just ... Yeah , you just uh , never told me . You know what , Becca ? Just hold on a second cause this is a hard thing . What ? What is hard for you ? Look , you remember I came back from the war , I started dating Beth . Right ? Yeah , you met at the VFW Christmas dance thing . Yeah , well ... Yeah , we met at a dance , but it was a high school dance . I was 17 and Beth was 15 . And your grandmother wouldn't let me see Beth anymore after she got pregnant . She blamed me . I went off and joined the army to get as far away as I could and ... - Seriously ? - Just listen to me . What ? But I was not trying to get away from Beth or from you . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? You're my daughter , too . How could you do this ? How could you both do this ? All of these years , why ? Because it was the only way that Alice , that your ... That your grandmother would allow us to be in your life at all . Look , I missed the first ten years of your life . And as soon as I got out of the army , I came straight home and I married Beth and we stayed in that house and we were around you as much as we possibly could be . How could you do this to us ? I mean , how could you do this to Tony ? That poor kid . I'm sorry . I'm very , very sorry . But you got ta know this is torture for us , too . This was torture for me , you know . And I didn't love you any less . I mean , maybe it was different on that outside . Maybe it looked different on the outside . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I um ... I feel like the earth has just dropped out beneath me . I can't ... Well , it has , sweetie , but you are not gon na sink . I promise . We're not gon na let you . Oh , don't you promise me anything . I don't believe a word you say to me . I don't wan na talk to you anymore . Don't call me . - Tell Beth not to call me . - Becca , please . I will have someone proxy for me at the will reading . Becca , you ... Beth . He's at Becca's . He went to Becca's . Why did she send that to you and not me ? She's still mad at you . And ... I think it's good they spend some time alone now . She's worried about him . What do you mean ? Did you talk to her ? Yeah , we spoke last night . Did you tell her ? I had to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , please . I haven't seen you in a while . Yeah , I figured with all this weird Asian pig virus thing going around that I should probably come in . Okay . Still a non-smoker ? Drinks per week . Depends on the week . Um , three to five . Okay . You definitely have a fever . And considerable inflammation . Uh , no strep . Probably the flu . Oh ! Says you got a birthday next week . 37 ? Okay , so children maybe . Children ? No . No , no . No . I , uh , I don't even have a houseplant . No , I travel way too much and when I'm home , my hours are insane . I don't even have a dog and I 'd really like a dog . Look , Rigby , you're gon na have to find a new doctor . Oh , geez . I am really sorry I didn't come in for the flu shot - this last year . - No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an obstetrician . You're pregnant . What ? No , that's impossible . Look , we'll have to confirm with a blood test . No , but we always used a condom . You ever wonder what's on the other side of that 97% effective . Welcome to the 3% . How long do I have ? Jesus , it's not a death sentence . No , it's a life sentence . - What ? - Okay , okay . I can see you're stressed out . I'm gon na write you an antiviral for the flu . And here's the name of a great ob . Right . Good luck . Now can you show me which one is the red one . That was pretty stupid , you know . I know . Beth's going crazy right now . I know . I just couldn't be around them . Kids are supposed to lie to their parents . Not the other way around . Yeah , well ... It's so screwed up . Tony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I don't wan na do this now . I wanted to tell you every single day . My hands were tied . I don't believe that mom or grandma or whatever the hell I'm supposed to call her now . I don't believe that she would want this for us . There's a lot you don't know about your grandparents . Well , apparently my whole life is based on a lie so ... Make that times two . Is it a lie that we love you ? Both of you ? I wasn't strong enough to stand up to her . I wasn't . But she was my mother and I was 15 and scared . She took Peter away from me . I can't handle this . I have a trial in two days that I'm not prepared for so I can't do this with you today . Okay . You know where I am . Come on , Tony . You know what , Becca , this really isn't a tragedy . It's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to breathe in thirty years . Hey , if you 'd ever gotten pregnant , would you have considered termination ? What a terribly strange thing to ask me . What do you mean ? What do you mean , what do I mean ? Well , what are you asking me ? What are you trying to say ? Well , what do you think I'm saying ? You think I'm saying that I wan na have a baby ? Seriously look , if I wanted to have a baby with you , I 'd tell you , I wan na have a baby with you . So have you been reading my emails ? Why would I read your emails ? I don't know . Seems like an awfully strange question to come up - out of the blue . - It's Rigby . I saw her today . I'm supposed to keep it a secret . She's pregnant . Really ? I didn't even know that she was seeing anybody . She was . She's not anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out whether she wants to keep it or not . I got this email the other day . I've been trying to figure out how to tell you about it . Here it goes . Dear nm45729 , what is this ? Just keep reading . I recently submitted a request to the state adoption board for a copy of my family medical history . And I learned they had little on file , but said they would forward a message if they could . If you're reading this , then you're my biological mother . I don't wish to know your identity and I'm not ready to give you mine , but I have some questions about my health and I wondered if you could tell me a little bit about anything I should be aware of on you or my father's side . I have no record of who my father might be . You should know that I have wonderful parents and I'm very happy . Thank you . Nc45729 . I never told you about it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend that it happened to someone else . It's your private life , you know , before you met me . No obligation to tell me anything . But I love you . So if you wan na tell me , I'm here . Okay ? Twenty-three years ago , I was completely lost . And I uh , and I fell for this guy . This musician who convinced me to go on tour with him as his girl , so ... We were on the road for a few months and I was not prepared for that lifestyle . I mean , there were so many drugs and there were some really weird parties and really ... Things . Anyway , after , after a couple months I couldn't take it anymore and I left and I went back home . And then I uh , I realized that I was pregnant . And I really couldn't say who the father was . I couldn't even take care of myself . And uh , there was no one to help me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her up . Ever regret that ? Everyday . What do I say to her ? Hi , I'm your mother . I was a complete slut and I don't know who your father is . Do you wan na meet her ? I don't know . I just ... Maybe . You don't need to rush it . Give her the information she wants . And if you need to meet her , you'll both figure it out at some point . It's gon na be okay . I really want us to see each other again , but I don't want her to find out that we're still talking . It's not exactly the kind of thing that fosters trust in a marriage . Well , just give me a little bit of time to figure out how to make that happen . Me too . Okay . Oh , hey . I'm sorry I woke you up . No , it's alright I ... I couldn't ... I couldn't sleep . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the loan guy called . I didn't get it . Oh my god , baby . I'm so sorry . It's okay , it's okay . It's okay . - I'm sorry . - It's okay . Hey listen , I've been thinking about something . Um , I was thinking about what you said earlier about leaving your parents and you're right . You stood up for me , you know , you ... You took a chance that I would be the guy that you 'd hope for . Isn't that what people in love do ? Yeah . Yeah , but what they don't do , or what they shouldn't do is ask the people they love to give up other people that they love . No , that ... It didn't have anything to do with you . That was my choice . But I let it happen so I feel like it was our choice . And it was a mistake . Look , I know that it's very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like you have a little bit of pity for me , can I ask you a favor ? Well , you can always ask . I want you to call your parents . No . Why ? Listen ... After my mother died , there hasn't been a single day that's gone by that I don't think about what it would've been like to share every single moment with her . The good and the bad . And it's just too much burden for me to feel like I am the reason that you don't talk to your parents and god forbid something should happen to them . Kevin . No . Not after the way they treated you . No . Look , they never treated me badly , Gayle . Being careful about bringing somebody into your family , that's admirable . That's not judgmental . And look at me . I mean , they were right to be worried about their daughter's future . I don't blame them for that . I just ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the best for you . And I just want you to think about it . I'm just being selfish because I'm thinking maybe we can move in with your parents . It's better than living in my grandma's closet in Newark . I will think about it . Thank you . How was it tonight ? Pretty tame . Made some good tips though . How are you feeling ? Super tired . I slept the whole day so now I can't really sleep . What are you watching ? Just channel surfing . Still pretty wound up from today . What are you eating ? Chocolate brownie . Your faves . I'm kinda tight with the sous chef so he made me a batch . Speaking of which , I'm gon na send you some . Thanks . Hey . Don't worry , okay ? Someone's gon na be a match . You know what I 'd like ? I 'd like to know what it feels like to have a man be in love with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or how I make him feel about himself . Me . What if I don't get to feel that ? I think some people live really long lives that never get to feel that . I'm scared , too . You know why I called you ? I mean , after all this time . To save me from a lifetime of debauchery ? Um , I guess because we've been best friends forever . You're the last person that I know that really loved me . My mom said that once when she came up to campus . You remember that weird modern dance recital that we were in ? She said afterward that she thought that we seemed like sisters . You know that place I was telling you about in Chinatown is getting a new shipment in from Hong Kong . I was thinking about using some of my tip money and going to buy some new Brocade and Boucle . Only you can get that excited about fabrics . Okay , I mean I was gon na make you something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash then you're on your own . Sorry . Come on in . Take a seat . Uh , so uh , I just wanted to say thanks , uh , in person for what you've done for me . Uh , I know what I do with music , but those pictures , you really , you really captured something . Well , thanks . Thanks . I mean , you were the one that inspired it all so really were just a great team . I want you on my tour . Six months . Wow . That's amazing . Um ... Yeah , it would be amazing to have that kind of time to , you know like , tell a real story . Yeah , something amazing . So , yeah ? Yeah , I just have to check the dates and clear my schedule and ... Yeah . Alright . Cool . Amazing . Hey . Don't tell me you stole Beth's car again . I don't think I 'd try that one again . I took the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter for you to read . It's uh , grandma's writing . Your name's on it , too . Why don't you read it ? Um , you sure you wan na hear this ? No . To my bony Becca , my beloved girl who bewitched me the moment her eyes flashed at mine . By now you have learned the truth and no doubt you are angry at me , and Beth , and Peter for robbing you the reality of the circumstances of your birth . You are no longer a girl , but a grown person of great mind and heart . I ask you to reach deep inside yourself and ask , what should've been done ? A girl was not ready to be a mother and a woman who's not yet finished being one . It wasn't ideal , but I knew how to keep you whole so you could grow up to have all the strength you needed to understand that your life was filled with true love , not true labels . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my Tony , you might just be old enough to realize how lucky you are to have a sister . I hope you will be closer to her than anyone else because you two need each other . You must both forgive Beth and Peter . For they have been the one's carrying this heavy burden these many years . Only you have the power to lift the weight off their hearts . Set them free , my loves , and you will be free , too . Free to love any chance you get . What's this ? Dear Becca , Tony Irving , your grandmother , Alice Zelda Irving , has left her estate in the sum of $2.3 million dollars to her grandchildren , Rebecca and Tony Irving . Holy crap . Oh , miss gray . How are you today ? Hi , doctor Conrad , I'm ... Well , I see you were referred by your internist , doctor Hamilton . And my notes say here that you're here for a D and C . Dilation and curettage . Termination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But your nurse said you wanted to see me first ? Well , yes . We take the termination of pregnancy very seriously . Right . Well , I can assure you , doctor , that I take everything to do with my body very seriously and I've done extensive research on this subject and , you know , I'm quite prepared for the medical risks and as for the mental complications , it's not like some pubescent teenage girl with raging hormones that's surprised by her condition . You know , and unaware of the choice she's making . For the record , your hormones are , in fact , raging . And your primary physician has noted her that you were indeed surprised to find out you were pregnant . Yes . Right . I mean , I have considered having children , but I've decided against it . You know , I'm um ... I'm a photographer . And I shoot musicians mostly and I have this hectic schedule and I'm supposed to go on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy or motherhood or anything like that . It's a difficult decision for any woman . You know , I mean , really it's so easy for men , right ? I mean , they think that they have forever , but you know , I happen to know that after 40 , men's stuff is damaged , too . There's a proclivity towards schizophrenia and um , an increased risk of suicide or ... Maybe it's the other way around , but you know , it's just ... No one ever tells men , you know , just settle down and wait for the right girl . That's just ... Whatever's in a stone's throw , just grab them and do it . I can schedule you as soon as the new year . See , but I'm going on tour with Quinn after the new year . I'll make some time . Well , enjoy your holiday and after the new year , I'll ... I'll take care of you . Dear nc45729 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so glad to know that you are happy and well . That makes me feel the decision I made was not a mistake . Even if it may not have been the best choice . Of course your need to know your family health history is wholly understandable . I have attached a file that compiles as best a complete family history that I could gather . I am , however , deeply sorry to tell you that I am not able to confirm with absolute certainty your father's identity . I was a very confused young woman and lacking in self-worth . As you have put whatever worry I have had about your life at ease , please allow me to do the same in case you've ever worried about me . I , too , am well , and have found real love and self-worth in my life . I feel that what little sense I did have was knowing what I didn't have to give you then . And now I think , perhaps , knowing you are happy and have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was able to give you life when your mother couldn't and that she was able to shower you with the wisdom for which I could imagine or hope . I send you the same prayer I had 23 years ago . I wish for love and peace to be your everyday companions . Merry Christmas . Your natural mother , nm45729 . Everyone should have a tree on Christmas . Aww ! This is beautiful . Thank you . Let's hope Santa puts something under it . I stopped believing in Santa when he didn't bring back my mom from the hospital . Maybe we should um , give your dad a present . I asked him what he wanted for Christmas and he said all he wanted was his best friend back . Maybe you could just spend some time with your dad . Is he torturing you again ? I just gave her a piece of our tree , dad . Merry Christmas . Thank you . It's beautiful . Let's go . Merry Christmas . Hello , mother . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany's and guess who I ran into buying some guilt diamonds for his wife . I don't know , mom . I can't keep track of all the bed hopping in New York . Who ? Harlon Kinney . Oh , come on . Did you really think I wouldn't find out ? I sat on what ? Like a dozen foundational boards with Harlon . Six months at Wells and Kinney was enough . Yeah , for god's sake . I've actually been waiting to surprise you with something else that I've been working on . I had been listening to his nauseatingly insipid watermelon-breasted wife horseshoe herself into Valentino originals just so I could get you into that entree program . What could possibly be more important ? I'm sorry , mom . I'm not ready to discuss it with you . Waitressing ? We sent you to Dalton , Andover , and Princeton so that you wouldn't have to wait on other people . How can you be so insensitive ? You wouldn't last a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullshit . If an intelligent , talented woman like Carmen had half of your education , she would not be working for me . She would be me . I mean , really . What are you doing ? What ? Is it that , that Tricia girl from prep school ? I mean , ever since you have been back in touch with her , you have been just completely off your path . You mean , your path ? I have never , never seen you so ungrateful . Are you on something ? I'll bet that she is on drugs . You know , she always seemed like a stoner to me . Layla ... What is going on with you ? You know what , if you must know , she called me because she needed a friend . A real friend . And you're right . She is on drugs . She smokes a joint twice a day so that she can keep one morsel of food down since she's been shooting chemo drugs for her leukemia . Are we done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Just , just ... Just wait . I can't . I have to go . If Kevin knew I was discussing , he doesn't know that I'm talking to you . Okay , sweetie . Well how much money do you need this time ? This time ? You know , god , this is why we don't talk . It's because all you wan na do is judge . No , no . I wan na try to help you and your father would want ... You can't tell dad ! Alright . God , why would you even do that ? Okay . I understand . I won't . You know , this is not like the last time . This is not a loan . Okay . This is an investment . I get it . Fine . You will get every cent back and more . You know , you and dad invest in stocks all the time . This is exactly like that . Okay , it's exactly like ... So when do you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment ? I get it . I see what's going on now . What ? What are you talking about ? - God , I am such an idiot . - What ? You're only doing this so that you can get control again . No , sweetheart . I-I-i ... We want you back in our lives . I miss you so much . You can't buy me . Okay , it's a business investment . I get it . I respect it . Kevin and his brother are getting into designer cakes . Oh , really . Cakes ? Kevin and cakes . No , if you're gon na undermine this , forget it . No , no , no , no , no ! Please . You know , I can't do this . I can't do it . I can't do it . Well , it's up to you . No , it's up to you actually . It's up to you . I haven't seen you , my child , for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly right in some kinda predetermined phrases then you're going to hang up on me ? That isn't fair . It is not fair . Whatever I've done . I didn't raise you to be a bully . God , what is your problem ? What is my problem ? Seriously , you ask me that ? Don't you realize , life is short and I love you and I have not seen you for two years . And that's all my fault . No , probably it is my fault . You know ... When you were born and I saw you , I didn't know that I could ever need anything that badly , that I could ever love anything that much . Just ... - My life just stopped . - Mom . I mean , when I held you for the first time , I didn't know if it was for five minutes or five hours or five weeks . I mean , time just stopped . - Mom . - In a good way . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , mom . Yeah . I mean , it was just , you were so perfect and I was so proud of myself for making you . You weren't overbearing . There was just so much ... Pressure ? Attention . And it was just relentless and overwhelming . I just never felt worth it . Oh , sweetie . My ninth birthday , I don't know if you remember that party ... There were sixteen kids and Mr . marquee on the front lawn , two peanut allergies , and I think there was some conjurer ... Right , uh well , when I blew out my candles ... Two red , three blue , four white . Okay , rain man . When I ... When I blew out my candles ... I wished to be good . And I know that my grown up brain now says good enough , but I will never forget that . You know , I wan na be good . And it never came true . But you were . You were over and over for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my miracle and if miracles are good , then you were good . You were good . How much do you need ? 32,000 . Wow , really ? For cakes ? That's ... What are they , designer ingredients ? You know , it's uh ... Storefront , delivery truck , mixers , and ovens . It actually is a very thorough business plan . Yeah , yeah . Um ... And this is really ... This is what you wan na do ? Sure . No . Of course not . I want to go back to college . I want to teach art history . Well , then let's do that then . Let's do that . It's easier said than done . No , I bet you could get enrolled in the fall . It's not about logistics . It's more a question of childcare facilities . Oh my god , really ? Oh , sweetie , that's wonderful ! You're not a touch disappointed . No , why would I be disappointed ? Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Producing a daughter is spectacular . Well we don't know yet if it's a boy or ... It's a girl , it's a girl . - Oh , you know that for a fact . - I do , I would bet a designer cake business on it , yes . Why do you think that ? Seriously . Have you met your grandmother ? Uh , yeah . Is she not the sweetest woman in the universe ? Absolutely , no argument from me . Well , I made her life miserable for years . - Really ? - Yup , yup . - She never told me that . - No . That is actually really funny . I needed to have you to teach me how to be a daughter to my mother . Oh , god . It's definitely going to be a girl , isn't it ? And she is going to torture me , but I guess it's no more than I deserve , right ? It's no more than you deserve . Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mom . Excuse me , is someone sitting here ? Miss gray . Rigby . Of course , Rigby . You mind ? No . Hi , doctor Conrad . What are you doing here ? Eating . Right . Why are patients always so surprised when they see their doctors in the real world ? Eating and grocery shopping . I guess it spoils the illusion . You know , we don't wan na see our super heroes forced to endure the mundane . Mm . I'm really sorry about the diatribe about the man , sperm , woman thing the other day . I kinda rant when I get nervous . Eh , it's fine . How's the pasta ? It's really good . - Hi . - Oh , hi . What can I get you ? Hm , a glass of Chianti and uh , seafood marinara . Thanks . Rigby , such a cool name . It's my mom's maiden name . Her dad never had any boys so you know the story . Hm . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . Um , I thought I wasn't supposed to . Oh , I thought you were going to um ... No , I am , yes . I am still , I just ... I just thought maybe I shouldn't . Probably a good idea . Can I ask you a personal question ? Hm . Does your wife ever mind you working so closely with other women ? I look at the body clinically for a living . I mean , lips can be used for talking as well as kissing . The hands for working as well as touching . The female organs for giving birth as well as conceiving . I mean , the whole body can be sexual . It's all about the context . I don't think I 'd be too happy if my husband did what you do for a job . Hm . I didn't realize you were married . - No , I'm not . - Yeah ? I'm just saying , if I were . Oh . Did you deliver your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do that . If my husband were my doctor , I 'd have to keep some mystery . I'm that way . I'm this way . It was nice seeing you . You , too . Bye . Bye . Hey , you okay ? Can you bring her a water ? And I think , she's done . Okay ? She's pretty gone . You alright ? Let's get you some fresh air . No cameras . Can't you see she's drunk , asshole ? Get off of her . What the hell are you doing ? What the hell are you doing ? - Get the hell off my bus . - Yeah . Come on . Hold on . Hold on , sweetie . Nelson . Nelson . Hi . Hi , mom . Wow , look at you . You look good , mom . Mm , it's different , huh ? Yeah . They don't let you get too fixed up here . They say it's like another way to mask your feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought you 'd given up on me . Third time's a charm though . I think . I hope . You okay ? I'm sorry I haven't been to see you , but there is a new album and I just finished the tour . That's really great , honey . Wow . Everything sounds like it's going real good for you . I should've called sooner . No , you're calling now . Mom , I didn't just call to say hi . Things got a little out of control on tour . I got a little out of control . I almost did something really bad . I'm coming to get help . I figured if my mom could do it , I can , too . And after , I was wondering if you 'd come and stay with me for a while . You know ? Help me get some things straight . I'm so sorry . I'm so ashamed . Did I do this to you ? It's okay , mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left us , we're still here . You and me . Good morning , miss gray . I'm going to be giving you some twilight sedation for the procedure . Okay , what's that mean ? It means you won't feel any pain , but you'll be slightly aware of the room and what's going on . Just kind of like you're in a groggy state . May I just speak to doctor Conrad for a minute ? Well , the doctor's on a very tight schedule this morning so why don't you let me go ahead and get the iv started . And doctor will come in and talk to you while we prep you , okay ? Look , ma'am ... I'm about to potentially end a life here and certainly change my own , so forgive me if I'm not overly concerned with the schedule of you or the doctor . I need to speak with him before anybody touches me . Rigby , everything okay ? Yeah . No . I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this instant , in my life when everything is under the best of circumstances and I am young and healthy and I have a roof over my head . Sometimes I'll take a vitamin and I'll choke . Or I'll get food poisoning and I'll be up all night vomiting and I'll faint on the bathroom floor and I'll think what if there wasn't anyone . What if no one's there ? You know , kinda scary . I'm scared . And then I think how much worse it'll be when I'm not as young and not as healthy . And then I think , is that a reason to have a kid just so they'll be there to pick you up when you fall , just because you were there for them . I mean , look at me , I am not there for my mother because I am too much of a coward to look in her face and see that she doesn't know who I am so I pay someone to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my perfect , gorgeous , angel of a mother lose her mind . I mean , god , I am not fit to take care of anyone . Parent or child . But , I mean , I mean people have been doing this since the dawn of man , right ? They don't stop and contemplate all the what if's because if they did there wouldn't be anyone here . I wan na keep the baby . We can do that . Yeah , definitely , we can do that . Aren't they just gorgeous ? They're amazing . Why can't you just tell your mom ? She could like totally help you . It's just that if she helps me , I might never know what part is me and what part is her and if I'm gon na do this , then I need to know what I'm really capable of , you know ? Like really capable of as in alone . No , this is a disaster ! If you're gon na do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Sure . - Okay . Okay , get me half a dozen Gotham Ganache and twelve Harlem truffles . You heard the boss , boys . Step up the pace . Let's do this . What happened ? I thought you didn't wan na meet . Um , no , she sent me an email saying she wanted to meet as soon as possible . When ? Right now . I'm on my way to meet her at the duck pond . She said that she would have something red with her , an umbrella or something . Oh my god . I think I see something red . Oh , I'm so nervous , I think I'm gon na get sick . No , you're not gon na throw up , alright ? Look , take three deep , long breaths . Remember this isn't the first time you're seeing her . You're the first person she ever met . I love you . I love you , too . Look , I'm happy for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m gon na be somebody's stepfather . Okay , bye . Miss Scott ? Hi ! It's Layla . Layla Chapman . From the pig and the cow building . We met on facetime . You were speaking to my mother , Nina Chapman . Miss Scott , are you okay ? I'm so sorry . It's just that I'm supposed to be meeting someone here , is there someone I can call for you ? March 15 , 1991 . You were born at 3:22 pm , march 15 , 1991 . It was a rainy day , you were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen . You ? - Is it okay ? - Yeah . Today is mother's day and it's a perfect spring day . And the air smells like you're perfume . I'm having a baby , mom , and I can't stop thinking about you . I almost didn't wan na have her because I couldn't bear to love somebody as much as you and risk my heart . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating their stories , I forgot create my own . Mom ? In here , Layla . Hi . Hey . Here . What are you doing ? Well , I'm working . You know , we've got that couture gala coming up and I need you to help me pick a frock . What are you talking about ? I thought that was decided by a committee months ago . Aren't you wearing Zac Posen ? I am , that's why I never eat , but I was wondering what you're gon na wear . Really ? Well , how come you never let me go ? Yes , well , since then I've been privied to some new information . That makes me think that it might be a good idea . Why didn't you tell me that this was what you were working on , hm ? Waitress ? Yeah , but Georgina helped me streamline them a little . I can't believe Trisha sent them to you . Yeah , well she knew you wouldn't . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were working on ? I happen to be pretty good at launching hot , new designers . Really ? I don't know . I thought what if you hated them ? What if you thought that I sucked at this ? I wanted to earn your praise , not be entitled to it . Well ... Hm ... This is the one . It's sleek . It's architectural . It's classic . It's you . I like this one , too . I , um ... I can't tell if I get it from her or from you . So ... Why didn't you just tell me you wanted to meet her ? I didn't think I did . When Trisha got sick , it made me wan na know more about my medical history , so I sent a letter . And then when Trisha died , I thought what if that were me . Oh , honey , it's not ... No , mom , I mean it . I thought what if I go my entire life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , I can't describe it , but you have no idea what it's like to not know a single person who has your hands or your eyes or your crooked teeth . I just ... I just wanted to see her . Are you mad ? No . It's ... It's as natural as breathing . Honey , everybody wants to know where they come from . You know , I'm always so amused that I have that same crinkle here in my nose like grandma . And then I sit in the car with my purse on my lap just the same way . She lives in my building and she's working with you . I mean , that's a weird coincidence . Oh , it's not a coincidence . I think it's a mother's instinct to search for her child . I am sure that someway she was looking for you her whole life . Thanks , mom . And anyway , I'm just ... I'm just so dang impressed . I'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! More than , well ... Just more and more . I love you , too . - Surprise ! - Surprise ! We know it's mother's day , but can I still call you Beth ? Oh my god . You did all this ? Well , I had help . So much for soccer practice . And you ! Aw ! Mm ! Alright , who wants champagne ? - I do . - I do . Can I have some ? - No ! - No ! Come on , you guys . Here , help me . Come on . I missed you so much . I missed you , too . And I'm sorry it's been so long , I just ... You needed time . I did . I really did . You know , I'm just ... I'm just lucky to have you . No more secrets . No ! No more secrets . Alright , toast time . For you . For you . No , you get the little one . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other name , just as sweet . Thank you . - Cheers . - Cheers . Hey . How you doing ? You okay ? Mhm , yeah . I'm good . I'm okay . I can do this , doctor Conrad . Call me Andrew . You're gon na do great , Rigby . But I got ta tell you something . Hm . I can't be your doctor today . What are you talking about ? Now ? Now . Why do doctors keep doing this to me ? Listen , just listen to me , Rigby . I'm not married . I've never been married . I don't have any kids . I use the ring to keep a professional distance from my patients , but with you , it didn't work . I don't know if you have any feelings for me , but if there's even the slightest chance . I can't go into that delivery room with you . - Really ? - Yeah . I think I have to be the keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go great . Hi , Rigby . I'm doctor Barnard . I'll be bringing your girl into the world today . Going to see grandma . You ready ? Lydia . Meet Lydia . I'll take her out . It's okay , baby . It's okay . I just ... I need to tell you I'm sorry . Mom . I love you . I love you . Mom . I had my daughter , mom . She's just starting to look like something that might turn into a person . I was so scared . But now looking back on all the lives and stories of others , I know it will be alright . Some people can't see the love they have until they see it through someone else's eyes . Some people have no mother . And others have more than one . Others don't see that mothers come in all shapes and sizes . Sometimes there for just a moment . And sometimes they remain for a lifetime . Her name is your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come to life again . Every time I call to her . Lydia . I hope your last thought before you slipped into the darkness of your mind was that I would remember everything about you . Everything . ? I would never let a tear fall from your eyes ? ? no , no , no , no ? ? ' cause everything you are to me ? ? ooh , I could never let you hurt inside ? ? you mean so much and I'm so thankful that you're in my life ? ? and I appreciate your love and all your sacrifice ? ? without you by my side , I never could survive ? ? I wouldn't be the woman standing here before your eyes ? ? you've taught me strength and you gave me guidance ? ? whenever faith was lost , you were there to find it ? ? and all because a mother's love is unconditional ? ? with all my heart and all my soul I wan na let you know ? ? that I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I love you ? ? and I will never place anyone above you ? ? said I thank you , I thank you ? ? and I love you , I love you ? ? and I will never , ever place no one above you ? ? you have given me life ? ? and I just want you to know ? ? that you're the reason I'm here today ? ? I will never let go to everything that we share ? ? and nothing can compare ? ? I thank you , I thank you , I thank you ? ? here's what I'm sayin ' ? ? see , I've been blessed to be raised by a woman so strong ? ? cause even when I did things wrong ? ? you would show me just the way that I should carry on ? ? you kept me safe , and you protected me with all you had ? ? and any time I was in need you gave your very last ?

Yeah , but I'm up , so whatever . You're a night owl . Don't you have a curfew ? ( yawns ) 11:30 . But my dad goes to bed at , like , 10 , so . He doesn't check up on you ? No . He trusts me .

Besides , you know , sometimes I like having a night to myself every once in a while . Sometimes it's nice to just decompress , do some gaming , listen to some music . ( @calm music ) Yeah , no , I get it . I just ... Wait , I think I hear my dad . Bye . My dad took my phone . What , why ? I'm grounded for two weeks . He found out that I missed curfew . How ? He came in here , like , at midnight and I guess I wasn't in here , obviously . WTF , this is my room . That's a total invasion of privacy . I don't want him in here touching my stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he goes to bed at , like , 10 . Yeah , usually . But lately he's all freaked out because he's retiring in a few weeks . He just roams the halls drinking nightcaps . What's he freaked out for though ? ' Cause isn't that good news ? You 'd think . But he , like , doesn't know what to do with himself now , so . What about your mom ? My mom died seven years ago , so she's not much help . Oh my god , I'm so sorry . I didn't know . Whatever . I'm over it , but my dad needs to find a new hobby because this is getting ridiculous . Sugar free . [Teel] Wait , if you're grounded , then how are you talking to me ? Oh , he didn't take my computer . He thinks I'm doing homework on it , which is you . So I guess I'll be doing you every day after school . Whoa . Mind out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who said it . Girls are allowed to have their mind in the gutter . It's sexy . When guys do it , it's just , it's gross . I wasn't aware of that rule . Stick with me . You'll learn . [Teel's_Mom] Hey , sweetie ? Hon , you've been up here quite a while . You been playing video games ? What ? No , I'm talking to my friend [Madison] . [Teel's_Mom] Hon , please don't . What ? I'm telling the truth ! You know what Dr . Thomas said about you making things up . Hi , Mrs . Johnson ! Oh my , I'm sorry I didn't realize . [Madison] Daniels , do you remember me ? I used to live down the street from you . [Madison] , what a surprise . [Madison] Daniels , of course I remember . You didn't tell me you were talking to [Madison] Daniels . Yeah , actually , Mom , I did . Well , that's great , that is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again . You too , Mrs . Johnson . [Madison] Daniels , huh . See ? My parents suck . She seems nice . You have no idea . You might think that your parents suck , but that is just a teenage syndrome that distorts your perception , when in actual scientifical fact , they are perfectly legit . Who says I'm being scientific about it ? No , I'm just saying , I need more proof before I accept your assertion . What are you , a lawyer ? I'm gon na be . So pony up . Okay . My parents , every year , make me try out for sports , even though I don't have any talent or inclination or even the slightest interest in the jock arts . Eh , wrong answer . They're just trying to make sure that you're well-rounded . Which is actually the distinctive trait of a loving parent . Last year , I auditioned , or tried out for the track team and I deliberately ran as slow as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Totally reasonable . Right , but then my mom read the school guidelines and she discovered that technically the coach isn't allowed to cut anybody from the team . It's a little known secret . So she forced him to let me run . It was like a whole to-do at my school and then finally we came up with this shoddy compromise that kept me on the team as the mascot . What's the mascot ? Oh no ! Yeah . So now I'm at all the track meets , which no one even goes to in the first place , and I'm stuck wearing this ratty old costume that hasn't seen the light of day since like 1992 . I think they just wanted me to kind of get involved and make friends , but it really just made me a target for the coach's kid who kept kicking me in the shins . Okay , although misguided , it came out of concern for your well-being . They tried to get me to go out for football this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle to get out of that . Yes , okay , all dads want their kids to play sports . That's like a primal instinct from our hunter-gatherer days . It's not my dad , it's my mom . Unexpected . Yeah , it's like she's on this mission to keep me from becoming ... A dweeb ? Thanks . You'll survive . It gets worse . Always . You remember how I said I wanted to audition for Bye Bye Birdie ? [Madison] You did ? Yeah , I told you that the first night we talked . Yeah , yeah . Bye Bye , yeah . Right . Well , I had to miss the auditions because my mom decided we should take a spontaneous trip to visit my grandma . Thank you , Mom . Family's important . Yeah , but grandma didn't even want us to come . So not only did she force us on grandma , probably just to ruin the long weekend that she had planned with her man that she's been seeing who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants her for her money , but that we should butt out of because it's grandma's only source of happiness right now . But she also deliberately ruined any chance that I had of being in the show . I don't know , the jury's still out on this one . And she took grandma's car away from her because she's not allowed to drive anymore , so now it's just sitting in our garage instead of hers . ( laughs ) And you're complaining about what ? She just scored you a car ! Mad , I can't even drive it . She won't let me get my license . "" My mom won't let me get my license . "" No wonder you're grounded , you're mean . Nuh uh . And manipulative . [Madison] What ? That poor Dix guy didn't know what he had coming . [Madison] Uh , wow . Where's all this animosity coming from ? I don't know , I'm just calling it as I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any friends ? What ? No . [Madison] ' Cause it's nothing to be ashamed of . I'm not ashamed of it . So you admit it ! No , I don't ... You are a devil woman . ( @calm music ) What ? I'm gon na help you . I don't need help . [Madison] Fine , not help . Coaching . No , I don't want to be your project . Okay , okay . I'll be your friend . What is this , second grade , Mad ? And as your friend , I'm gon na help you get more friends . I can not believe we're having this conversation . Okay , who's your best friend ? I'm not answering that question . Do you have a best friend ? Who are your friends ? Come on , [Teel] , just give me some names . Do you have any friends ? No ! You don't have any friends ? No . Not even people at school that you casually talk to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm running late so nobody realizes I don't have anybody to talk to . Wow . That's really sad . Yeah . Well , that's kind of why I wanted to try out for Bye Bye Birdie , because I thought I could at least fit in with the theater geeks . What about Facebook ? What about Facebook ? Do you have any friends on Facebook ? Are you not on Facebook ? [Teel] You mean Fakebook ? Okay , not everyone on Facebook is fake . It's like , it's like Clark Kent . How is it like Clark Kent ? Clark Kent has a secret identity and a public identity . You need your public identity . I just , I don't like where this is headed . Okay , by the end of the year , you're gon na have 150 Facebook friends . That is a promise . Come on , it'll be easy ! I think I'm gon na hurl . You don't even have to talk to anyone face to face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need a Facebook profile page . ( fakesthrowingup ) Okay , [Madison] , that is a great idea . Thank you so much , yeah . Yes , [Madison] , that is a great idea . What is the worst that can happen ? I could find out nobody likes me . How is that any different from right now ? Shut up . [Madison] No , you shut up . Talk to the hand . So Sophie just told me that fricking Ella Wilson is moving in on Cole . So while I'm stuck here grounded , she's flirting her ass off with him . And I do mean her ass right off . She's super slutty but it doesn't help that she's kinda hot in like a trashy sort of way . I mean , I can still flirt with him in Earth Science and Math but she's in those classes too ! I do get Ella-free lunches though , Tuesday and Thursday , because she goes to talk time with my dad . Still . Wait , with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he's trying this whole "" You can talk to me , "" I'm one of you "" thing . But really it's a bunch of desperate girls clamoring for attention , it's disgusting . I've forbidden Sophie from going . Hey , Mad ? [Madison] What ? I made a Facebook page . ( screams ) No you didn't ! Let me see . ( gasps ) Oh ! Oh , you're a handsome devil . [Teel] Very funny . No , I'm serious , you're really cute in , like , a Rhett and Link sort of way . Yeah , well , there it is . Another reminder that I have zero friends . Uh-uh . Not after you accept my friend request . I don't know if I should accept requests from just anybody . [Madison] Har har . Fine . Accepted . What do you think of my new profile pic ? Where's the rest of your skirt ? Hey , if you got it , flaunt it . Hey , Facebook friends ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Sophie to add you too , so that'll make it nine . They said it couldn't be done . Wait . What ? None of these friends go to your school ! I thought we went over that . I don't have any friends at school , so why would I friend them online ? Who's Parthoran ? ( laughs ) Is that his real name ? He's just a guy I met at the Akron Fanboy Expo . [Madison] You talked to someone you didn't know ? It's way easier when you're wearing a costume . [Madison] Well , what's his name ? He goes by Parthoran . [Madison] Where does he live ? British Colombia . [Teel] , don't you want friends from your own school ? Yeah , but you have to have at least some small reason to friend them , right ? No . People are friend whores . I just don't know if I want to be that . Will you just join this century ? Seriously . What about other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lost touch ? Maybe . Such as ? [Teel] ! [Sonny] . [Sonny] Denbrowski . [Sonny] , there you go . But he's like a jock boy tool now . Beggars can't be choosers . Cole joined choir ! Can you believe it ? Sophie and I have been working on him for weeks and he finally caved . I think we're gon na survive the Ella Wilson attacks . She only has two classes with him now and now I have four , including Health and next week we're doing the unit on human sexuality , so I can say a whole bunch of accidentally dirty comments and get him in the right frame of mind . Gross . Oh , and I have Sophie running interference for me while I'm grounded . So her instructions are to interrupt all conversations between Ella and Cole and to never , ever let them touch . Which is gon na be quite a project because Ella is super grabby . Wait , when did you go to the beach ? I thought you were grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that I'm grounded . These are old , from the summer . Don't I look hot ? If you mean sweaty , then yeah . That's my beach glow . I'm not a slut . [Teel] I didn't say that . [Madison] Then why are you criticizing my pictures ? I'm not criticizing them . First my skirt is too short and now you think that I'm some sweaty whore ? You don't look like a ... Look , I can post whatever I want . I don't need your opinion . You asked me ! Yeah , learn to spot when a girl wants a compliment . Okay , I'm sorry . I didn't mean it , I was just like ... You look hot . You look totally hot . You don't mean that . Yeah , I do . I just felt weird saying it to you because ... I don't know . What's wrong ? Nothing . [Teel] Are you sure ? I have to go . Wait , Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Madison] . Are you feeling better ? Yes , did you friend him ? Yeah . Are we gon na talk about yesterday or ? Live in the now . What happened ? He accepted my request . ( gasps ) Your first Facebook friend at school . Yeah , it's all very good but it's not like it means anything . [Madison] Why not ? Because he just sits there on a list . So ? Then look at his feed . Learn something about him . Maybe you can start a conversation that way . Maybe . And you got ta post stuff too , okay ? You're in the game now . No , Mad , I hate all that stuff ! It's all like "" Oh , I'm playing my Xbox . "" Look at me play fast . "" Look at me play slow . "" Look at me play boring . "" Okay , then we'll post something interesting and somebody might be interested . I doubt it . T , sometimes it's just for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . It's nothing . We just had this biology test today and he sits right behind me in class . So I was like "" You ready for the test ? "" And he was like "" Not even close . "" And then we took the test . Oh , okay , yeah . Awesome . Yay . No girls . What do you mean no girls ? I mean , no , I don't have my eye on any girls right now . Not even your peripheral vision ? Look , I'm sorry ... The connection ... Failure ... [Teel] , come on ! You're telling me there's not a single pretty girl at your school that you think about more than the others ? There are lots of pretty girls at my school , Mad , but most of them are stuck up bitches so I'm not really interested . [Madison] But you're such a flirt ! I am not a flirt . Yes , you are ! You flirt with me every single time we talk . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other girl ? I think you think I live in a very different world than I think I live in . I think you think I think that . [Teel] Shut up . I'm just saying ! "" I'm just saying . "" Oh . Oh , I see . What ? No , it's cool . I get it . What ? Nothing , I just ... No need to say another word . ( laughs ) What are you talking about ? I see who you're saving the good stuff for . What ? What good stuff ? Seriously , what ? Screen tells me all I need to know . He accused me of cheating . Not like I was cheating off of someone else because he knows I got like the best grade in the class , but apparently the second half of [Sonny]'s scantron was , like , identical to mine . So now Mr . Hanson thinks I was just holding up my test so [Sonny] could look over my shoulder . But why would I help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only friended because you made me . He just sat there the whole time with this , like , tight shirt on and all the girls in the hallway were creaming their pants . T , I'm very sorry , but I've got a situation here . Bigger than a cheating scandal ? Yeah , actually . Two words . Retardedment party . Offensive much ? Just because he's retiring , the school board and the booster club want to throw my dad a party . Well , that's according to him . So my dad thought "" Oh , I can't use "" the school board's resources for nonessential purposes . "" Why doesn't my daughter throw the party ? "" So now I'm stuck planning the party that the school board wants to throw for my dad and I have to do all this crap like invitations , decorations , food , invitations . You said invitations twice . Not to mention the doppelganger cake . Clarification please ? That's the exact replica of Mrs . Spiceman's cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpalatable and probably give everyone the runs if it's anything like last year's . ( laughs ) T , don't laugh ! My dad's actually making me do this ! Can't you just ask her not to bake one ? No , she's like the school board's biggest donor or something . Truth comes out . And now he's gon na be home all the time and I'm gon na have to wife it up for him even more than I already do . That man can't , like , do anything for himself . I'm gon na have to make his food and change his diaper and god knows what else now that he doesn't have an administrative assistant . You're trying to win . [Madison] What ? Yeah , you're trying to win the sucky parent contest . Whatever . You love planning parties . Even mentally challenged parties for your dad . I bet you're telling all your friends about this and relishing every minute of extra attention that you get for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And also , by the way , if you enjoy the suffering caused by your parents , then that negates the suckage and instantly disqualifies you from the contest . Okay , first of all , there is no contest . And even if there was , trust me , I would win . ( @doorbell_rings ) Who's here ? It's [Sonny] . Wait , [Sonny] ? The [Sonny] ? Yeah . The hell is he doing here ? I don't know . What are you waiting for ? Go ! T , go ! Okay , okay . [Madison] T ! What , what ? Take me with you ! Okay , I'm bringing ... What do I say to him ? Jesus , T , it's like your first day as a human ! Well , I don't know what he wants . He's the same guy you hung out with before . No , he's not , not even close . Let me see ! He's just standing there . Wait , T , I lost the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open the door ! Okay . Hey . [Sonny] , what's up ? Hey . Oh , he is scrumptious . [Sonny] My mom said I should apologize to you for cheating off you in class today . T , I can't see . What ? [Teel] I can't see why you 'd feel like you 'd have to . It's totally cool , I understand . Thanks for stopping by . What are you doing ? What is that ? [Teel] Oh , it's nothing , I was just on the phone with my friend and ... Hey , [Sonny] , I thought that was you . Come in , come in , come in for a few minutes . I could scoop you and Terrance some ice cream . Like old times . [Sonny] Sure , that sounds great . Wait . Who's Terrance ? ( laughs ) Well , hello there , Terrance . [Teel] Ha , very funny . Why didn't you call me ? I wanted to know what happened ! [Teel] I don't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like six times . [Teel] I noticed . Well , I saw those mean posts on your Facebook . I wanted to know what's going on . Why is your camera not on ? [Teel] Must be broken . Okay , that is the stupidest lie I've ever heard . [Teel] Seriously , it must be like a bug or something . Whatever , turn it on . [Teel] Can we just talk like this today ? No , why ? [Teel] To keep up the mystery . Shut up and turn it on . [Teel] I can't . Are you naked or something ? [Teel] No . Then turn it on ! Or I'm hanging up . [Teel] Wait , wait , please don't hang up . T . Okay , seriously , I got my life back today . I am officially ungrounded and I may never talk to you again so this might be your last chance . [Teel] ( sighs ) Okay . Oh my god . T , what happened ? Nothing , I just fell . On your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some sports ? Yeah . [Madison] T , did you get in a fight ? No . [Madison] What else would make your face look like that ? A fight implies that I was an active participant . [Madison] You got beat up ? By who ? Just a bunch of ass cavities . [Madison] At your school ? Yeah . Did you tell someone ? [Teel] No . What did you tell your parents ? Could we talk about something else , please ? No , your face literally looks like a hamburger . Mad , can we please talk about something else ? Okay . Terrance . And not that either . I don't like it . Come on , Terrance , I need to know your origin story . Please ? I'm gon na keep calling you Terrance . You're so annoying . That's not very nice , Terrance . Fine . My dad started calling me [Teel] when I was a little kid because I would always run around the house wearing , like , a cape yelling "" I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Ss yet . Oh ! Yeah , so now my mom is the only one who calls me Terrance and I hate it . My name is [Teel] and that's what you should call me . I can't call you T anymore ? T is fine . Okay , so I need to hurry because Cole's performing at the school talent show tonight and my dad's giving , like , his last speech as principal or whatever . He's all freaked out . He just walked in on me while I was showering . He couldn't wait 10 minutes to borrow my shaving cream ? I was all like "" Dad , get out ! "" And he's all like "" Nothing I've never seen before . "" Whatever . I don't even care though because tonight I'm a free woman . I am ungrounded ! Mad , I think you wear too much makeup . That's not insulting . No , no , don't freak out , please . I just think you look better without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup on ! [Teel] Actually , I have . It was the accidental pool party ? That night ? Okay , so ? So I just think when you put on all that makeup , it hides everything that's beautiful about your face . T , I have to wear some . No , no , I know . I just think you should wear less . So we see more of you . T , you can't do this to me right now ! Cole's gon na be there ! I know , I know , that's why I'm telling you . I was already freaking out about seeing him . And now you drop this on me ? I know . Just let me help you . What do you mean ? Let me help you put on your makeup . No ! [Teel] Just try it for one day and if you don't like it , then you can go back to your old way . What do you know about makeup ? My mom's a hairdresser who also does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was literally a little kid . I can do this . Fine . Fine ? Fine ! Okay , good . Now just look right into the camera and I'll tell you what to do . No , like right into the camera . Okay ! Good . T ! Okay , okay . Start with powder . Powder ? I don't have any foundation on . [Teel] You don't need it . Yes , I do . I am way too pale . No , you don't , your skin is like flawless , it's the best feature of your face . Plus , it's a good thing to be pale . How ? You ever heard of Snow White ? You are such a nerd ! Trust me , less is more . Good . Now eyes . Just a little shadow . That's good , that's good . Now mascara . No , uh-uh . I need eyeliner . I have bug eyes . Fine , fine , but it has to be the lightest brown you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be razor thin , so we don't even know we're seeing it . Good . Good . And mascara ? [Teel] Unless you want to skip it . No . ( laughs ) Okay , that's plenty . What color blush do you have ? I use this one . No , that's way too orange for you . You want your cheeks to look like apples . What about the red one ? This one ? [Teel] Yeah . So I can look like a whore ? ( laughs ) You won't look like a whore , just don't put so much on . You just brush it on really lightly , yeah . ( whines ) Good . Now lips . Not your usual red . We're going regular lip gloss . You are killing me . Something shiny but without color . Your lips are already perfect . Yeah , that's great . Now let me just look at you for a second . ( laughs ) Don't look at me like that , you're making me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror for the whole day and just notice how people react to you . Okay . You look beautiful . Shut up . T ! Forward to tonight's performances . As many of you know ... [Madison] It's my dad . I'll be retiring in a few weeks . [Madison] Droning on . [Madison's_Father] You're thrilled , I know . I've spent time getting to know each and every one of you . [Madison] It's Cole . [Madison's_Father] That means you , Chad Mendez . I've always told you ( mumbles ) ... ? I'm basking in sunshine on a rainy Wednesday night ? Nothing's impossible when you're here ? I take a look out the window and you'll see ? How long is it gon na rain ? ? I just smile Oh my god . Okay , okay , okay . I'm gon na do it . There she goes . Cole ? You were , like , amazing . Thanks . These are for you . You were amazing . I just sang what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , totally . Wow , flowers . Yeah . Well , you look , you know , like . Thank you . Hey , you know , it sucks that your dad's retiring because he's like , he's the best . Oh , no , that's ' cause he's not your dad . But you know . You still grounded and stuff ? No . Well , my parents aren't home tonight and I wanted to know if you wanted to come over . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I could make time , yeah . Cool , I'll text you . Okay . Okay . Bye . ( laughs ) T ! You are a genius ! Oh , easy now . Okay , Mr . Fashion Consultant . You have to help me choose what to wear to Cole's for the big night . You really think tonight's the big night ? Duh . Didn't you hear that song ? It was totally about me . We could do this shirt with jeans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T , help ! What about the dress ? The dress ? The dress ? What am I , like 30 ? At least try it on for me ? Okay . Whoa , wait , whoa . What are you doing ? A little shy , Mr . T ? No . T , okay , when you have a girlfriend and you're gon na want to have sex with her , you're gon na have to see her naked . Okay , well , for now can you please just go off screen or something ? Okay . But you don't know what you're missing ! ( blows ) Wear that . Really ? Yes , really . It's ridiculously gorgeous , wear it . I'm sorry , T , I'm gon na have to use my veto power here . This shows more skin . T , I can't believe this is happening . Please be careful , Mad . Okay , Dad . Who else is here ? I hear music . ( knocks ) Mad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been worse . ( laughs ) It was worse . Oh yeah . Oh yeah , I forgot , Cole and Sophie , they had sex . With Sophie Sophie ? Are you effing kidding me ? How convenient , right ? Apparently after they dropped me off , they went back to his house and had sex . Big fat betrayal sex . [Teel] How do you know ? Oh , it's all over Facebook . And when I tried to talk to her about it , she full on lies to my face . You know , Mad , I think it's for the best . How ? Because you don't want your first time to be some hookup at a party . It was not a hookup ! It was Cole . And besides , it was not my , no . What ? It wasn't what ? Your first time ? [Madison] , are you keeping secrets ? [Madison] ! ( laughs ) Oh . How could you not tell me that ? Who did you have sex with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this ! I keep trying and I keep messing it up ! I'm sure they're fine . No , they're not , they're not fine ! They're not fine , they have to be perfect ! My dad is gon na see them and they have to be perfect . [Teel] He's not gon na mind . No , it has to be perfect ! I'm starting over . Hey , look , Mads . Stop . Let me see . Let me see . What ? It has a smudge right there ! It looks great . No , they don't . Mad , Cole's an idiot . I can't imagine what he was thinking . You're so much prettier than Sophie . I'm not pretty . You're right , you're not pretty , you're beautiful . Shut up . I mean it . You're intelligent and beautiful ... You're an intelligent and beautiful girl . Woman . Woman , even , Mad . You're an intelligent and beautiful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And beautiful . You said that three times . It was four . By the way , I have 37 Facebook friends . [Madison] That's great . I have an audition this week . You didn't tell me that . It's not really a big deal . [Madison] No spontaneous trips to grandma's house ? I found a way around that . [Madison] How ? I'm not going to tell my mom . What's the part ? Romeo . That's a big part . Sure you can handle that ? Well , you know , I memorized the speech but I don't really know what else to do . You show me . No . Oh yeah . After my whole ordeal with Cole , you don't think I deserve some entertainment ? Come on . Fine . You and your ways . Okay , but for tonight's performance of Romeo and Juliet , the role of Juliet will be played by the lovely and talented Miss [Madison] Daniels . Okay . Oh , and I figure the scene is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big romantic , he's just horny and wants to see Juliet's boobs . Wow . Okay . Here goes . ( gasps ) But soft ! What light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east and Juliet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she ! Be not her maid , since she is envious ! Her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it . Cast it off ! It is my lady . ( sighs ) It is my love ! ( laughs ) See how she leans her cheek upon her hand . Oh , but I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek . That's it . So did it suck that bad ? No . That didn't suck . That didn't suck at all . ( rings ) It's late . Why are you calling me ? Were you asleep ? Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wake up , because I have something to show you . I'm up , I just can't promise I'll stay up . [Madison] I think I can keep you up . We'll see . We will see . So , what ? T , don't rush me . Mad , I'm really tired . I want to go back to bed . You wish . You're being weird . Good night . No , T , wait , wait ! T , give me a sec . I'm just gon na put my head down right here . So I've been thinking . I've been thinking a lot about what you said . Whatever it was , it sure was brilliant . How I shouldn't try to have sex with idiots , especially Cole . It's good to be idiot-free . I agree . I was also thinking about you . I'm flattered . I was thinking about you a lot . And how you're not an idiot . So ... This ... Is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? Seriously , Mad . Just enjoy it . Do you like it ? Uh ... I'll take that as a yes . [Madison] , don't . Don't be a prude . Mad , Mad , stop , seriously . This is not , I'm not watching this ! I'm not watching . Why not ? [Teel] Because it's weird and desperate . Weird and desperate ? Yeah . You're an ass ! What ? I'm trying to give you something ! My own personal internet porn ? Is that what this is ? Well , Mad , that's what it feels like . So I disgust you . No , no , you don't disgust me . Then what ? We're friends and you wan na stay friends ? Well , yeah . Fuck you . Wait . What ? ( dings ) ( dings ) ( rings ) What ? I'm sorry . Okay . I'll hold onto that while I cry myself to sleep . I mean it . I didn't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm serious . I figured you 'd be out chasing all the gorgeous popular guys . T , you're gorgeous . No , I'm not . T , yes , you are . And you're sweet . And you actually listen to what I say . What did you expect ? I don't know . [Madison] First you internet stalk me , then you have all these deep conversations with me , then you're all like "" You're beautiful and intelligent "" and Cole's an idiot . "" He is an idiot . Yeah , well , you are too . Yeah , I guess I am . Then why do I feel like the idiot ? Look , Mad , I've been driving around all night trying to decide whether to tell you this . Wait , driving ? My mom's afraid to practice with me , so sometimes when I can't sleep , I take my grandma's car around the neighborhood . Rebel . I don't really like girls . I'm hanging up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it . You don't get it . I don't really like any girls that way . Because ... Oh , crap . I like boys . What ? Yeah . I think I might be , you know . That's convenient . Mad , I mean it . You're the first person I've ever told . Wait , really ? Really . I've been wanting to tell you for like a really long time but I didn't know when or how to bring it up . Well , this was perfect timing . I'm sorry . Are you ... Are you sure ? I'm not really sure about anything . Then how do you know ? Well , I mean , there aren't really girls that I think about more than any others except for you . But then I just think about , you know , what we're going to talk about next time we see each other . Not other stuff . Do you think about other stuff with boys ? Yeah , kind of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Sonny] . Wait , him ? Yeah . Him . A lot . I can see why . Me and him used to be such good friends when we were kids . But then we both changed so much and he became really good at sports and I became really good at watching him play sports . ( laughs ) T . Is this why they beat you up ? Yeah . Well , yes and no . [Madison] What do you mean ? Well , it was because of [Sonny] . Wait , he beat you up ? No , no , no , no , it was his friends . [Madison] He didn't . Well ... You remember when he came over to my house after I helped him cheat ? You said you didn't . [Teel] Yeah , that's what I said . Okay . Well , ice cream with my mom was perfectly awkward . But then we started talking about this card game that we used to play when we were kids , Magic ? And it turned out that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , years ago . And so I told him that I still had it . So we went up to my room and I gave it back to him . And then we started looking at all the other cards and kind of looking at each one and reliving some of our old battles . ( laughs ) And then I honestly don't know how it happened but there was this , like , tingly electric gravity between us and it kept pulling us closer and closer together . And then suddenly we were kissing . ( gasps ) I know , I was , like , shocked too . It was literally like every fantasy I ever had was coming true in one simultaneous moment . And so we kept kissing for like five minutes and then , you know , both of us getting more and more into it . And then really suddenly , he pulled away . Like super abruptly . And he got out of there as fast as he could . He didn't say anything to me as he was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like magic . T ! So what happened though ? He completely ignored me the next day at school , so I tried texting him . But he was just like "" Who is this , how 'd you get my number ? "" So I mustered up the courage to go talk to him after school . Well , I wasn't gon na show you this , but whatever . Here . Hey , Mad , I know you're in school right now but I wanted to show you my latest triumph . I think I'm gon na go try to talk to [Sonny] again . Wish me luck . Hey . Hey . [Teel] So biology sucked today , huh ? Yeah . Listen , I got ta go . [Teel] I was actually wondering if maybe we could ... Hey , that that fag you were talking about ? Yeah . I don't know what he wants , but he's not gon na find it here . I think I know what he wants . [Teel] Can we go somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Teel] I just was ... Whoa ! Get away ! Get away , assbag . [Teel] Get off of me ! That was a mistake . [Teel] Get off ! Like that ? Oh , [Sonny] , [Sonny] , I want you so bad ! ( laughs ) ( crying ) T . Yeah . T , I can't believe they would do that . Is this gon na be weird now ? [Madison] Us ? Yeah . [Madison] No , T . Yeah , it's gon na be totally weird . This is why I didn't tell you for so long , Mad , because I knew things would get all weird . No . No , they're not weird . Yeah , well , if you say so . T , I'm serious . You got ta give me a break . I just found out tonight while I was in my underwear . ( rings ) T , wake up . I have an idea . Don't you ever sleep ? What if you start a gay-straight alliance at your school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any in your area . You could connect to other gay kids at your school . You could maybe even help them out . Yeah , help them get the crap kicked out of them . No , T , that's the whole point of GSA , so that wouldn't happen . I'm sorry , not interested . T , you need support . Look , I really appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not ready for that . T , you can't just sit there and suffer . All by yourself . Yeah , I can . [Madison] No , T , you need to tell someone . I did . No , someone other than me . People need to know so that they can help you . They're the one's who need help . Fine . Fine , then make them deal with you . Mad , stop pushing me , okay ? I'm not pushing you . I don't want to be your cause anymore . You're not my cause , you're my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just look at the website I'm sending to you . You just posted that on my wall . [Madison] So what ? So now everyone's gon na think I'm gay . [Madison] No , T , it's just a link . It's a link to a gay website , Mad ! It's for straight people too . You don't , you don't send that to someone unless you think they're gay ! You are gay . Well , I'm sorry if I don't want to flaunt my sexuality all over the internet like some people I know . Why are you being such a jerk ? Because you just outed me to all my friends ! What friends , T ? You have like 78 acquaintances on Facebook who don't even see your feed because you don't post anything . T . ( sighs ) ( rings ) ( @slow_music ) ? It's been a while since I've been here ? It's a cold day in hell and ? I will be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it judges everyone ? Beautifully broken , just like everyone ? Let's never say goodbye ? Let's never say goodbye ? Here we are ? In this park , chasing stars ? Staring at the distance ? The distance ? Hold my hand , take a chance ? Forget your plans , just sit back and listen ? And listen ? All these moments that we share ? I wouldn't trade them for any reason ? Any reason ? Do you remember all the nights ? You 'd stay awake to help me fight ? Your smile's all I need to survive ? As long as you're with me , I'm alright ? Let's never say goodbye ? Let's never say goodbye ? You and I , side by side ?

( laughs ) Mad , you don't need to be fixed . Mad , really , it's alright . Yeah . Yeah . You used to make me climb around the back because supposedly the front was being guarded . I 'd get all these scratches all over my arms from the bark . ( crying ) Me too . Yeah , I know . What do you mean ? ( knocking ) [Madison's_Father] Maddie , it's almost nine ! Okay , Daddy ! Wait , what are you talking about ? Keep watching what ? [Madison] . Okay , I promise . You're kinda starting to freak me out . [Madison] . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop . ( crying ) Hi , I 'd like to report a crime . ( rings ) You shouldn't have done that . Are you okay ? What happened , did the cops come ? Did they arrest him ? Yeah , they came . And my dad cleared things up . It was all a misunderstanding . What do you mean , cleared it up ? Didn't you tell them ? I told them that I made it up . What ? T , I don't think we should be talking anymore , okay ? [Madison] , what the hell ? I have to be there for my dad right now . He's going through a lot , so ... [Teel] No , no , [Madison] .

Hey , Mad , really wish you would talk to me right now . I'm trying to stay awake over here . Nothing a caffeinated beverage can't fix . ( sighs ) ( dings ) Oh , it's my mom . She's probably freaking out . I bet she's called the cops like three times . This could be a very pointless trip . 19 messages from my mom , six from my dad . And yes , they have called the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into a fugitive . Morning , Mad ! I hope you're seeing this . I never knew it would be so beautiful .

Guess where I am right now ... T , you shouldn't have come here ! Go home ! I figured you might say that , but ... My dad is right downstairs ! Don't worry , I'm coming around the back .

What do you want ? The exchange of thy love's faithful vow from mine . [Madison's_Father] Maddie ? I'll be right down , Dad ! I had to see you in person . No , T . I already told you that I can't talk to you anymore . No , we can go to the police again and tell them everything . No , they won't believe me , no . [Teel] They'll believe me . No . [Teel] I'll be with you the whole time . I said no . Why ? [Madison] . ( crying ) Look , he's not a monster , okay ? Yes , he is . No , he's not , you don't know him ! You don't know him !

When I didn't have any friends ? You remember that ? Now I have 142 Facebook friends . Mad , can you believe that ? I never could have been able to do that without you .

You remember that ? You called me back from the party because I was lonely or something . And then suddenly I had one friend and that was enough . T , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know that it was that bad . I was mostly just so amazed that this beautiful , brave , smart girl wanted to talk to me . You helped me so much . It's okay to need help . 142 Facebook friends ? [Teel] Acquaintances . I wish we 'd made it to 150 . ( knocks ) [Teel] We got ta go . [Madison's_Father] Maddie , what's going on in there ?

Let's clean up before Bama gets here . I don't want her telling me I'm a lousy housekeeper . Oh , shoot . I got ta get ready . We're supposed to be at the bank . Why do you have to go to the bank ? Because we need money for stuff , like your braces . But I don't want braces . I want a video game player . Charlie , your mama's gon na tell you something true . No matter what you choose to do or be , life is easier if you're pretty . It does a girl no good to be good at video games . Knock , knock . Hey , y'all . Hi , Mama . Hey , Bama . Hey , Bama . It's hotter than a fur coat in Marfa out there . Guess you're just gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please don't start . I'm trying to get ready . Hey , Mama , that laundry was folded . It will be when I get through . Hi , Bama . Jenna . One , two . Whoo ! I'm so glad to see you . Give Bama a great big kiss right there . Look how big you're getting . How's it going , Cassie ? Well , I'm a two-pack-a-dayer trying to quit smoking , that's how it's going . You know what gum with nicotine tastes like ? Gum with nicotine . How's the knee ? Oh , doesn't work and keeps me up all night . Sounds like my last two husbands . Heh . What are you gon na do if the bank turns you down ? No idea . Well , it ain't a sin to be poor , but it's damned inconvenient . Well , what do y'all think ? You're either a magician or twins . Mama , you look pretty . You sure do . It's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in that outfit . That's what I'm counting on . Like you said , ' Use it until you lose it . ' Heck , I've lost it and I'm still using it . What smells like pumpkin pie ? Oh , it's me . These scientists did a test and figured out that the smell of pumpkin brings blood How to a man's you-know-what faster than anything else . Where 'd you hear that ? I read it in some woman's magazine . August 2006 issue . Reese Witherspoon was on the cover . Rex , come on , we got ta scoot . Babies , be good to your Bama . Bye , Mama . Bye , Mama . Owl Dang it . I just broke my nail . Sugar , no one's looking at your nails . Been married to you nine years , I haven't gotten to your nails yet . Come on . Now , Sam , don't slouch like you do . Knockers up . I am so nervous . Yeah , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he's gay . Well , I did say ' whatever it hikes . "" Oh , baby , how did we get ourselves into such an awful mess ? A lot of people asking those questions these days . Samantha Horton . Hell's bells , I do not need Carol Reed telling me how perfect her life is . Hey , I dumped her for you . You got the big prize . Don't tell her why we're here . Hey , Carol . Hi . It's been forever . Don't you look pretty . I do believe you were wearing that same dress the last time I saw you . Well , aren't you observant . Jim and I were just here on business , but tomorrow we're off to Hawaii and then we're going to New York to do a little shopping . We all got to stimulate the economy , right ? Bless your heart , always thinking of others . Bye-bye . Y'all travel safe . Will do . Bye . Mrs . Horton , Mr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we're here about , uh , this letter . Well , I 'd say it's a bit more than a letter . This is a notice of intent to foreclose . Yes , and we know we're seriously behind in our payments , but the rates suddenly jumped so high-As adjustable rates do . Mr . Sweeny , it's like I was trying to tell you on the telephone , my physical therapy job just got phased out and Rex here , well , he hurt his knee so bad that he had to quit his construction job and get surgery . We're just trying to pay back the medical bills . The heeling's been e whole let slower than I 'd hoped . I sympathize , but mortgage payments must be maintained-It's not just about the mortgage . We're strapped . Completely . Getting dinner on the table , it's hard . We need more time . But , Mrs . Horton , I can't really give you-You can call me Sam . Sam . That's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Very much . But , uh , there's nothing I can do . With the current financial situation , this bank must hike a zero-tolerance position on non-payment . But what about the government hailing you out to help us out ? Where's the help ? All I can tell you is that unless we receive payment on the 15th of this month , foreclosure proceedings will begin . And we'll lose our home . Yes . That is what foreclosure means . I'm sorry . No , you're not . Not really . Even though you're plenty at fault here too . The day we met you , you told us that a subprime ARM loan made good sense and not to worry about rate adjustments because we would be able to refinance before the loan resets . Then you told us it would be ' advantageous for us to enhance our income statement to help facilitate the approving process . "" Those were your words , exactly . Now , I don't think any of us remembers exactly what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , with a taupe shirt and a cream tie . It had a quarter-sized hot sauce shin on it . You were worried because you were getting ready to take your photo ID . There's the tie and there's the shin . Now , what exactly don't I remember , exactly ? Like I said . At least you got a month's extension . It's something . Is it ? What's gon na make it better next month ? Chocolate milk shakes and cheese fries . That will make it better for about five minutes , but I'll take it . Here's my application . I know you guys aren't hiring , but if you could have the manager keep that on file ? Thanks . You're really desperate , huh ? I would join the Army if I could wear heels . We 'd hire you at the bar if we could . I know you would . There's nothing promising for Rex Not a thing . Nobody's even hiring . If there were any construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy with a bum knee . Gosh , this must be killing him . You know men and pride . Men are complicated . No , they're not . Men are easy . "" I'm thirsty , "" "" I'm hungry , "" "" I'm horny . "" That's men . Although not necessarily in that order . You guys , I never thought I 'd say anything quite as sappy as ' it was not supposed to turn out this way , "" but it wasn't .

Licensed massage therapists . "" I'm licensed . I don't know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just skin . It makes them feel better . Doesn't say they're hiring , but it's worth a call . It's all the way in Lareena . It's more than an hour's drive . Well , there's nothing here . You were smart to go and become a lawyer . My mom said I was too pretty for law school . My mama said I was too skinny to get a husband . My mom said to always wear lipstick , even if you're just going to the market . Well , to Texas moms . Texas moms . Texas moms . Your usual time , you little devil . Okay , I've got to go now . All right , bye-bye . Hi , there . Can I help you ? Hi .

I dropped my baton . Well , I entered in Miss Texas , but then I got pregnant and married . Now I got three kids . I'm dying to have babies . You were smart to start young . I'm trained in shiatsu , and deep tissue , but I can pretty much do any kind of massage y'all want . Well , look at you . I'm a real fast learner , and I'm just desperate for a job . Can you start tomorrow ? Really ? That's it ? Pretty much , baby . Thank you . Who's starving ? I could eat a buttered monkey . Yay ! Breakfast for supper . Yeah , we're celebrating Mama's new job . So now I can play Hag football ? Flag football is way down on the list of things we need to be paying for . Please ? Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there's the team photo and equipment . And what if you break your glasses ? But- Conversation is over . Hey , hon , I didn't hear your motorcycle . That's because I sold it . Rex , you loved that thing . Yeah , I kind of like having electricity too . Baby , I know that wasn't easy . Good riddance . You know what doctors call them ? Donor-cycles . Are we rich now ? No . Hey , sweetheart , what's it like at that Kind Touch Health Spa ? What's it like ? Oh , no , a bee . Watch out , Brady , they can smell your fear . Hey . Mama . It's all right , I got it . You know what , it was real nice . Rich clients , big tips . Yeah ? Maybe I should ditch my job at the salon and come rub some backs with you . Unless they're mole-y or hairy . Woman , you wax hoo-has . Yeah , I remove the hair , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing . Daddy , what is a hoo-ha ? Camptown ladies sing this song Hoo-has , hoo-has Camptown track is Eve miles long Oh , hoo-he day Hi . Here I am . Oh , hey , honey . Welcome . Why don't you come on back and meet the other girls , okay ? We got a bit of a lull right now , but when that Cowboys-Redskins game is done , we are gon na be plenty busy . Come on . Okay . All right . Here we go . Okay , ladies , say hi to Sam . Hey , honey , welcome back . Hi . Okay , now , just real quick , I started this business 15 years ago . I wanted to be a novelist , and I still do , but this pays the bills a whole lot better . Doreen used to be a dancer . Well , cruise ships mostly , but some dinner theatre . Now , she's been partners with me for 10 years . Isn't that right ? Yeah . Tanya's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and she is also an amazing tattoo artist . Oh , and this here is Emma , our barely-legal-looking newbie . How long you been here , sweetie ? Uh , two months today . So nice . Hey , hon , you got a client in 4 , why don't you scoot on over . All right . Okay . And you're all licensed massage therapists ? Sure , yeah , we all have licenses , and we all give massage . It's a teensy bit more than that . What do you mean ? Well , like my writing teacher always says : ' Why don't you show me , not tell me ? ' Come on over here , I'll show you . Let me just get these open here . Hi , Richard . This is one of those two-way jobs , you know , like they have in all the cop shows . How are you doing ? Pretty good . How are you ? I'm great . Oh , I love that SVU . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama is Jayne Mansfield , so you know those breasts are real . Now , for safety , we always bring the first-time clients into this room . It's above board , nobody does anything they're not comfortable with . You understand ? Wow . You understand ? Yeah , I guess . Okay . What am I gon na do now ? I guess that's why they didn't show me around the first day . Wanted to ease me into it . Guess I'll have to find something else , or maybe Rex will get a job or maybe that lottery ticket I've got in my purse has three good numbers on it . Hey , Dee , what's up ? It's Rex . You kind of need to come pick him up . He's in no condition to drive . You know how it gets in here when the Cowboys lose . I'm on my way . Dee , isn't it hard being on your feet in your condition ? I'm used to it . Heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I'm not pregnant . And it's good for business . Behind the bar , the big boobs keep them here , and at closing time she comes out and the belly sends them home . Ha , ha , ha . Fair enough . Stupid . Where is he ? He's cleaning up in the john . We'll help him get into the truck . Yeah , he's gon na need it . I can walk , man , I can walk . Dude , you can't walk . Rex had a rough day , Sam . And your mom took the kids , told him to come blow off some steam . Yeah , well , good idea , Mom . Thank you , Phil . Sure thing . Take care of my boy . So I heard you got a job . That one in Lareena , right ? That's so awesome . Yeah , I don't think that's gon na work out . I don't know what I'm gon na do . Sometimes I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this isn't you . You're Samantha Dale Horton . You're the prettiest girl this town has ever seen , and you always get what you want . Besides , I've spent too many years being jealous of you to feel sorry for you now . You'll figure this out . I am so sure of it . I wish I was . Hey , I love you . Love you . You call me tomorrow . Okay . Well , folks , if you moved to Texas ... Damn it , Rex , we're almost out of gas . We're looking at temperatures in the 90s all week long , possibly hitting triple digits by the weekend . Dang gas guzzler . You look good . Well , you sure don't . What were you thinking ? Look , I spent all day standing outside of Kyle's Lumber Lot with the other day laborers trying to pick up some odd job that would pay enough for me to sign up my son for flag football . Rex . Hon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of that store , and I could see it on their faces . ' Look how far the football hero has fallen . "" I'm sorry . I had a bad day too . Stupid gas-guzzling piece of junk . Declined . Rex , where's your wallet ? It's , uh ... It's in my pocket . A dollar ? Damn it , Rex , this is not what I signed up for . This is America . A girl this pretty , she's not supposed to be poor . I'm sorry , I know that sounds all braggy and unfair and awful , but you know what ? It's true . You know what ? Dee was right . She was right . I am Sam Horton . I am Sam Horton , and I do not let life get me down . I do what I have to do , and I don't get defeated . Rex . Jacie ? Hi , it's Sam . Sam Horton . I'm so sorry that I walked out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avoid . Vacuum . V-A-C-U-U-M . Vacuum . Good . Now tableau . Tableau . T-A-So now can I go out for Hag football ? No . It's not T-A ? No , I was talking to Brady . You want an apple or an orange ? Orange . Please ? No . B-L-E-A-U . Tableau . Perfect . You're gon na do fine . We're all gon na do fine . Everything's gon na be fine . There's nothing to be scared of , I mean it . Sorry . It's Mama's first day at work , and I can't pick you up at school , so to say I'm sorry , I put two desserts in both your lunches . Wow , your new job's great . Come on , scoot . I'm sitting behind Mama . No , you aren't . You went last time . Mama . You know , and I pride myself on running a safe , clean business . We provide a reliable service at reasonable rates . We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open Saturday to Thursday , noon to midnight , but this being Friday , payday , we start early and stay till the last one leaves . It's real important that I work only when my kids are at school . Oh , that's fine . We do a huge lunch crowd . All the outfits are in a room in the back , but each of these rooms have everything you need . There's condoms and oils and such . Oh , and drinks and Viagra are on the house . You give away Viagra ? It pays for itself . The little blue pill keeps us in the black . We were worried when the economy tanked , but turns out that this is the most recession-proof business there is . And what about the police ? Oh , well , let's just say doughnuts ain't the only thing they're getting for free . Alrighty , let's get you on in the back room , because everybody's here on Friday . Alrighty . Now , for everyone's protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar , Emma wants to be called Salome . She won't do anything that's not mentioned in the Bible . Lucky for us , that's not all limiting . Tanya is Margarita . Unless the guy's into Asian chicks , then I'm Sake . That's right , and I'm Big Mama . I do mostly fetish stuff . I got me some kick-ass feet . So you , I think , we are gon na call you Brandy . Because you look like you go down real smooth . Brandy , okay . Now , like you saw yesterday , we screen everybody upfront , but if you got any problems at all , you holler . All right ? You know how to use a gun , baby ? No . I'll teach you . Tanya used to be a bounty hunter . It's crazy . Anyway , you got any questions ? No , I just feel like I might be sick . First time's the hardest . It's like the first time you kill someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on . What can I say ? I love sex . I'm getting paid to do something I love . That is such a blessing . Right ? You know , the work is what it is . You got to get into your own headspace on that , but at the end of the day ... Beats the hell out of waitressing . Nine a.m . Well , it is Friday , that's for sure . Okay , girls . This will help some . I'm still getting used to it . You don't even look old enough to drink . What brought you here ? I ran away from home to try out for American Idol , but they said I wasn't ready yet . So I'm saving money for a singing coach . You can't get home ? My family's Pentecostal . They're not real supportive of my Hollywood ambitions . I kind of liked being all rebellious at first , but now , I don't know . The money's good , but God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need that thought in my head right now . Emma , honey , you're Room 1 , and , Sam , you're in Room 4 . There's some pretty little outfits beck there for you , okay ? Oh , that feels really good , honey . Mm-mm-mm . Well , thank you . So where you from ? Am I supposed to answer that ? No . Sorry , I'm just kind of nervous . It's my first time . Not massaging , but , you know ... Really ? Yeah , me too . Oh . Well , now , look at us , two peas in a pod . So are you married ? Yeah . That's why I'm here . What the hell ? Well , that wasn't respectful . This may be my first time , but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to hit me . A man is not supposed to put down his wife . When was the last time you told her she was beautiful ? I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but women , we fall in love with our ears . Ah . You remember that I said that . Oh . Dang it . I am so sorry . That's my phone . I forgot to turn it off . Oh , it's my daughter's school , I need to hike this . Hey . Hey , baby , what's up ? No , you didn't . You won the whole spelling bee ? Well , with what word ? Diphthong ? Now , that's a hard word . Do you know how to spell diphthong ? What ? Okay , you know what , we're gon na celebrate tonight . Mama loves you . Bye . Can you believe that ? This isn't quite what I imagined . You know , your kid calling , me hiking about my wife . Maybe I should just- Okay , please . Please , you can't go . Look , I really need this job , and-Can I just have a do-over ? Huh ? I promise that you'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it right . And you know what ?

Well , then the other one , then . As you can see , going on behind me right now is a major bust of an alleged prostitution and drug ring . Apparently , there has been e months-long surveillance probe conducted by Mayor Summerlin . All pert of her campaign promise to bring law and order to Lareena . Summerlin is in a very tight re-election race and no doubt she hopes an event like this will help to put her over the edge . Now we can see the police are starting to bring out some of the alleged johns . The poor bastards . Ho-ho-ho . What , do they charge by the pound ? You don't have to shake the sheets to find her . The name of the establishment is the Kind Touch Health Spa , but locals here say they've long known that ... Oh , my gosh . Phil , turn that off now . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll keep you updated . Okay , now we're talking . Shut up . - along with the alleged prostitutes . Of course , they will be held separately .

They'll be holding a press conference and of course wow bring that to you as . soon as it happens . I knew it would end like this . Dee , please . No , you bail someone out of jail , you get to talk . At first , you did it to save your family , I get that , but then it was for you . You threw your whole life away for what's on your ears and around your neck . You're home . Oh , what did I do ? What am I supposed to say to him ? How am I gon na fix this ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rex , I'm so sorry . I know that I've really messed things up , and I'll do just about anything to make it right . So just look at me . Talk to me .

And we get there , and we're sitting in the parking lot holding that old dog between us , petting him , him loving the attention ... and both of us knowing it's his last day of life . And then you sang to him . That Beatles song . ' In My Life . ' And then I-I couldn't do it . I couldn't go in . And you took him , and you carried him in ... and you held him ... till he died . You did that for me . And any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , and I 'd think of that girl . And now when I think of you , it's gon na be this . Winner of the 1999 Miss Bixby Beauty Pageant is Samantha Dale . Mama ? Thank you , Eric . Hey , what are you doing up ? I heard the TV . Well , I'm sorry I woke you . Come here . You're watching your pageant video . Yeah . I like the part where you say what you 'd tell the president to do to fix the Middle East . Did you ever tell the president ? No . Oddly enough , he decided not to consult Miss Bixby Hills about international relations . Why are you watching this ? Just revisiting a time in my life when I felt like I was doing everything right . You look sad . Do you want me to sing to you , like you do when I'm sad ? I think if you did that , I just might fall apart . You're sweet , though . Then should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think they're gon na let me wear makeup in jail ? I'll try to smuggle you some . Thank you for helping me . I'm your friend . I haven't been a very good friend lately . Well , friendship isn't quid pro quo . Wow , you are a lawyer . What's your mom say about all this ? "" It's the reason you have more than one kid . So you can ditch the screw-ups . "" That sounds like your mom . All right , let's get down to business . It seems this whole thing was orchestrated by the mayor's re-election team . They're trying to position her as the champion of traditional values . How did she even find out about us ? Know someone by the name of Emma Hollings ? Oh , my God . She went to some religious group . Christian Fellowship Lodge . That's it . She found a lot of old people with time on their hands and cell phones . They bombarded the police with calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the mayor decided it was divine intervention . I sent her there . This is all my fault . They're looking to charge you with felony promotion of prostitution and possession of cocaine . You're looking at two years . Oh , my God . Are you still using ? No . Never again . I feel like dog crap . Well , you're gon na feel agitated , depressed . I mean , the works for a few months , and then , honestly , periodic cravings for the 10 next years . Guess the first two years will be while I'm in jail . Well , maybe not . I think we can use this election to our advantage . Don't they wan na look tough on crime ? But what they want more is publicity . The more attention that Summerlin can get from this , the better for her . The more we help her , the more likely she is to help us . And the best way to get attention is if we have good names to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the community ? Well , yeah , but I don't wan na hurt any of those guys . Well , I can't worry about them , I'm representing you . Besides , all the johns ever get is a slap on the wrist . There's personal and professional embarrassment , but they do more sleeping on the couch than jail time . I just don't know . Well , fine . Go to jail . Don't see your kids for two years . Okay , tell me what you need . That's better . And what about the girls ? Is this gon na reduce their jail time ? It might . I know it's a cash business and your clients used a lot of fake names , but-Not with me , they didn't . I need some good names , Sam . Truckers and frat boys ain't gon na do a thing for us . We need our Eliot Spitzers and Tiger Woods . What about a circuit court judge ? You're kidding me . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , graduated cum laude from-I know who he is . I had a crush on him for years . Well ? Let's just say sometimes small things come in big packages . Let's just stick to what we can use in court , shall we ? This is great . I need you to write down anyone else you can think of . I'm gon na need a lot more paper . What about the cuddle guy ? Cuddle guy ? Davis P . Lowell . Hedge fund manager , 44 . Three kids , Karen , Kathy and Keily . Lives right here in Lareena and likes to be held for hours . Oh , that's kind of sweet . Wearing only a diaper ? Okay , that's less sweet . I don't know how it is you do what you do . Well ... Beats the hell out of waitressing . Klaus Kransing , 52 , oil company lobbyist . He 'd fly up every Thursday during his wife's book club . When he 'd get all hot and bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds sexy in German . He gave her a diamond watch . She earned it . I pawned it for a down payment on Rex's Harley . Things any better at home , darling ? Still sleeping on the couch . We're doing our best to hide it from the kids . That's about to get a whole lot harder . Arnie Vanderbaush , 46 . He's a defense contractor from El Paso . And I think that's it . What about Jim Reed ? What , Carol ' the bitch of Bixby Hills "" husband , Jim Reed ? He came in , but I sent him home . He's been a regular for years . As much as I 'd like to stick it to Carol , please don't put him on the list . Okay . Okay . I mean , this is incredible . If we play this right , we're looking at minimal time for all of you . How many names we got ? Sixty-nine . That's , uh- Appropriate ? That's the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are gon na walk it over to the mayor's office personally . And her team has already tipped the press off . They know it's coming . I always knew that Sam Horton was nothing but trash . You know , I got a real common name , honey . A lot of guys around here got my name . Better hope none of them are on the list . Good morning . I heard my gynecologist was on the list . I don't even know what to make of that . Well , if my husband's on that list , I'm gon na lake all his stuff , put it on his bass boat and set it on fire . Screw that . Set his stuff on fire , sure , but sell the bass boat , girl . You can get good money for that thing . Ooh-whee , you're right about that . Heh . Don't this remind you about what happened in Odessa a few years ago ? Yeah . Heads up . Poor thing . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . I heard there's a lot of big shots on that list . Businessmen , doctors , lawyers . Lawyers ? Those gals must have been really hard up for cash . Some things even a hooker shouldn't have to do . But we don't wan na stay at Grandma Sarah's house . She thinks apples are for dessert . She makes us go outside and play . Okay , kids , that's enough . You say your goodbyes to your mama . We got a long ride ahead of us . Why can't she come with us ? Your mama can't leave town right now . We've been all over this , son . That's right . Listen to your daddy . Come here . Come here . Ooh . I want good reports , okay ? No matter what happens to me , I want y'all to know that my life has been very full because I've brought the three of you into the world . Mama , are you gon na die ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s go now . You two head for the truck . Help your sister into her car seat . I want Mommy to go . Go on , baby . I'm right behind y'all . Meet you at the car . I'm gon na come out and say goodbye . I always thought that was the saddest sound in the world . The person's zipper on their suitcase when you're not going with them . My daddy used to hike business trips , and I just hated that sound . I think it's better for the kids to get away from all this talk . Yeah , you're right . Maybe when y'all come back , maybe we could-Don't . Well , maybe-Maybe when all this is over , we could just think about moving and starting over ? Rex , please look at me . I can't look at you , Sam , which is real tough , because looking at you used to be just about one of my favorite things to do . Okay . Bye , skunks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Bye , Mommy . Bye , Mommy . Bye , Mama . You hike care , Sam . You're up early . Couldn't sleep . Thanks for staying with me , Mama . No time to be alone . I keep thinking I've hit bottom , then every day it just gets lower . I been up all night , thinking I just-Well , just realizing that I must have raised you all wrong . See ? New low . I mean , I forgive you because you're my only child , but how could you do what you did with those men ? For my family . Well , it makes my skin crawl . Thank God your father's dead . Oh , can you not completely destroy me until I've had some coffee ? Do you want some ? Sure . You like it strong , right ? So strong it'll walk right into my cup . I think your problem is I gave you too much self-esteem . What the hell ? It's true . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be Miss Texas or go to Hollywood and marry somebody famous . I wasted my life on your father . I wanted better for you . Your father went to a hooker once . Please do not tell me these things . Ever since this happened , people think they can tell me anything . The check-out girl at the Save-A-Lot told me she doesn't like to do it doggy style . Want some biscuits or something ? Sure . Is it just disgusting ? I'm picturing disgusting . Yeah . Yeah , sometimes it's real disgusting . Oh , honey . But it's kind of like an actress playing a part . All the attention I got back , that was something . All those men , some rich , some powerful , all treating me like I was the best thing in their lives . I guess there's just a little part of me that needed that more than I should . Anyway , now I just wish I could crawl up in a ball and make it all go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil than face the ladies at the salon . You think the paper's come yet ? I'll go check . Sam ! There she is . Oh , my Lord . We've all heard of the hooker with a heart of gold , but what about one with total recall ? Former beauty queen Samantha Horton , 28 , of Bixby Hills , Texas , has remembered Oh , thank God . Oh , my God . - Lareena's Kind Touch Health Spa , currently under indictment for prostitution and drug possession . The names of 69 of her customers have hit the papers this morning in what is already known as the List . Why is this national news ? It's about sex and not about them . Tricia , beck to you . Well , folks , the List has turned into the Line today , as police round up the suspected johns in the . story that ' . s got the whole town and much of the country talking-Now , behind me , you see the Lareena Men's Community Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police headquarters simply can't handle that kind of volume . And , as with everything connected to this story , Ah ! It brings out the crowds , the strong reactions and people looking to make some money . Over here , we have e group of local entrepreneurs selling some T-shirts . Let's take a look at a couple of them . This one has all 69 names on the back . And there's another one over here that says ' My dad went to Lareena and all I got was this lousy T-shirt and a new stepdad . ' Now , you'll also see plenty of women here who are videotaping the proceedings . You cover your face . I'm Tricia Wong , reporting . Now back to you , Roger . Will the defendants please rise for sentencing ? It is my understanding that this sentencing is pursuant to a plea bargain . And that you have waived time and agreed that I can sentence you immediately . Yes , Your Honor . Sentence is as follows for each defendant : Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a $100 penalty assessment . You are to be remanded immediately to begin sentence . This court is adjourned . That's all they get for ruining our lives ? Well , you're still harlots , and you'll always be harlots . The Lord has given us a warm day on which I have decided to address a subject that has made a great number of us hot under the collar , a couple of whom , shockingly , are in the ministry . Our community and our congregation have experienced e greet dee ! of pain and betrayal in these pest few months , and today I would like to talk about a concept that many of us have been grappling with : Forgiveness . What is forgiveness ? Who deserves forgiveness ? Are some things unforgivable ? The Bible tells us that forgiveness is essential for life . It frees us from pest wrongs and gives us hope for the future . The problem is it's just too darn quiet in here . It's not natural for a mother of three to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend this much time alone . I half wish a Jehovah's Witness would stop by . I finally have a wish come true , and I wish that ? I'm gon na give her a piece of my mind . Sweet Jesus . This is not gon na be pretty . I think they're gon na beat the crap out of me . Sam Horton , we know you're in there . We saw you in the window . Well ... Hey , y'all . How can I help you ? We 'd like to talk to you . You look like you just came from church . So I guess you don't have any concealed weapons . Anything can be a weapon if you want it to be . Come on in . Okay . Do y'all want some crackers or cookies or something ? Give it up , Sam . We all know this isn't a social visit , so let's get to it . Some of the women here have husbands who you , well , serviced . And some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all here for the same reason . Yes , I know why you're here . If you could just hear me out first . We were broke ... Hat broke . And I don't know if any of y'all have ever been there , but when it happens , and you realize there's a way to make it all go away , well , it's amazing what you're capable of saying yes to . And I know ... I mean , I really know that it is no excuse , but , my whole life , I just always depended on my looks , and I thought this was just gon na be another one of those times . I really thought I was doing the best thing for my family . But in the end , the very thing I was trying to save , I lost . So really , just about the worst thing that you could ever wish on me has happened . And I'm just real sorry , from the bottom of my heart , for the pain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice speech , but , frankly , we don't give a damn about you . We're not here to get an apology or to give forgiveness . Okay , well , then , what are you- ? Why do they come to you ? What do you do that we don't ? How can we make them think about us the way they think about you ? That's why you're here ? Mm-hm . Y'all want tips ? Yes . Oh . Oh , well . All right , then let's talk about that . For what it's worth , Carol , when Jim came to see me , I sent him home . You did ? That's in the past . Right now , let's just focus on the present . Okay , um ... You'll leave here today , tonight , your husbands won't know what hit them . My God , you showed them how to do that ? They wanted me to demonstrate everything . I went through two bunches of bananas . Ugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And happy birthday . It's not till tomorrow , but you're off then , so here . Tanya , thank you . Now , grab a fork . I'm way ahead of you . Make a wish . When I was little , I used to wish that everyone else's wishes would come true , including mine . I thought it would give me brownie points for being unselfish . Hm . It's Jenna's birthday too , right ? Yeah , her party's tomorrow . It's gon na be the first time since me and Rex separated . That'll be tough , huh ? Yeah , but he's doing good . You know , his exterminating thing's going okay , and he's finally getting over that I-can't-play-football anger . Well , that's great . No , actually , it's terrible . I mean , him going and getting all wonderful after he left me . Heh . I know , right ? It's good . We actually make great friends , and he's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He's gon na come and see me get my six-month-clean pin next week . Congratulations . Well , I got ta get to class . Five-dollar tip . Not bad for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie . Even though a year ago I was getting a $1000 tip and a marriage proposal . Minimum wage plus ' keep the change ' doesn't have quite the same kick , does it ? Hey , do you remember how we used to say : ' This sure beats the hell out of waitressing ' ? Yeah . Back then , we were just guessing . He's got ta be one of mine . They're all biters . Could you hold him ? Oh , I'm not really good with - Okay . Whoo ! Sam , I've been thinking . You did an awful thing . Oh , Mama , please , not on my birthday . Let me finish . You did an awful thing , but I think maybe I need to accept some of the blame . You're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I'm about to lose my looks ? No , you got a couple years left . Heh . What I'm saying is you're also smart , capable and strong . You screwed up . But you cleaned up your mess and you moved on . And I think maybe I should've encouraged you to rely more on stuff like that , stuff that lasts longer than beauty . Thanks , Mama . Still doesn't mean you can slouch . Straighten up . Yes , ma'am . I'll go tell them we're ready for the cake . Mama . Hey , how did you do ? I won all this . Go get some more . Go on . Hey , Daddy . Hey , sugar . So how's work ? You know , waitressing . It is what it is . School ? Hard . Scary . Exciting . Well , you look good . You look real good . I'm glad you're looking at me again . I can't believe our baby's 4 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , it's good to share a birthday with your child . It keeps the day from ever being able to get you down . She loved that dollhouse you got her . She wanted a pony . What about you ? What do you want ? You know what I want . I'm taking baby steps . What do you think ? I think that's the second-best birthday present I ever got .

No , Mr . Chance . She still ain't available . We present this controversial newsreel as a public service . In 1930 , Tom Finley ran for his first state office . You all know me . I'm just a plain old dirt farmer , like you folks . And Tom Finley was elected . Tom Finley ran for governor . I'm against loose government loose money and loose women ! And Tom Finley was elected . Tom Finley built a political machine and became Boss Finley . He also built a plain old dirt farmer's shack worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private speedboat . Boss Finley gave away the offshore oil of his state . The oil man made Finley a partner and Boss Finley made his oil partner the governor and kept him in office all these years . Four months ago , Professor Burtus Haven Smith ran against Finley's handpicked man . The only thing you have to fear is Finley himself . Next day , Professor Smith , fired . His home was invaded by hoodlums books and paintings burned on the lawn . Did you recognize any of them , sir ? No . They wore masks like this . I found this button . Yes , sir . I'm president of the Finley Youth Club , and I'm proud of it . But I don ' t know nothing about no book burnings or ... This thing , it could be dropped accidentally on purpose you know what I mean ? - But to date , there has been no probe no police action , no arrests . - Why ? - Shut that contraption off . These are the fruits of Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV network tolerate those filthy , black lies ? - Right here , in the heart of America . - Why , they ought to be ... Thank you , honey . - horsewhipped and shot . And if I wasn't mayor and against violence , I 'd do it myself . Well , if that TV report lied , why not sue them for libel ? If they lied ? You know , you surprise me , Ben . For a man who's smart enough to run a big daily newspaper you sure surprise me . Can't you recognize New York Red propaganda when you see it ? Do you call that TV newsreel fair ? Now , Maribelle , we're all on the same side . - Are we , Ben ? - Fair , you mean ? Well , your father's going on the same network . Same time , same freedom of expression . I 'd say that was pretty fair . A lot fairer than burning books and ... You accusing me , Ben ? Why , Tom Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might be a hot-blooded buck like his daddy ... - Now , Mrs . Norris . ... but he 'd never resort to violence . Never . And you have my personal guarantee that whoever did do it justice will prevail . - Right , sheriff ? - Certainly . What in tarnation are you laughing at ? Nothing , Pa . Nothing at all . Then shut up ! - Yes , sir . - Only idiots laugh at nothing . - Yes , sir . - When I was called from the clay hills where I was born barefoot and hungry , called by the voice of God , which I was ... Will somebody pick up that damn phone ! I ain't never forgot what I was called for . I didn't build a land of milk and honey to see ... - Where you going ? - Get something for that cough . Sit down ! I've hawked and spit all my life and I'll hawk and spit till the end of my days . You can bet on that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to be there . - Why , you know me , Tom . I expect you and your Daughters of Dixie to be there . God bless you , honey . And I expect you to be there too . I'll be there , Mr . Finley . At the press table . You'll be on the platform , at my side , in my support . No , sir . Not so long as you support a gang of juvenile delinquents called Youth Clubs ... - With a free hand to commit mayhem . - Hold it ! Now , maybe you're right . And maybe , just maybe the Finley Youth Club was mixed up in that shindig . That's why I'm gon na publicly disavow , disown and remove my name from the Finley Youth Club . And if my own flesh and blood was one of them hoodlums he's gon na pay , even though it brings shame on the memory of his dead mother . God rest her soul . They say I stole the oil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my state and my people . I also fought the fertilizer trust . I lowered taxes . I saved our hog-raisers from the Chicago meatpackers . A lot of folks like what I did but they don't like the way I did it . But if a bunch of hogs won't come out of your garden when you holler : Then you've got ta use language and methods that hogs and pigs understand . Do you understand , Ben ? Hi . Martini on the rocks . Say , you get any phone calls here for Chance Wayne ? No , sir . Operator ? I 'd like to place a long-distance phone call to Miss Louella Parsons . That's right . Person-to-person , from me , Chance Wayne . Yes , Miss Louella Parsons , the famous movie columnist . In Hollywood . The number is Crestview 1-4222 . Fine . Thank you . Oh , man , don't you know only squares drink gin martinis with olives ? May we have a couple of gin martinis , please ? Didn't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Leroy . Could you make that a couple of gin martinis with square olives . - Scotty . - Well , how are you ? Bud . - Hi . Is that the hand that made love to Jayne Mansfield ? Gee , I hope you didn't wash that hand . Gee , I was about ready to phone you guys . Leroy , did you know this is Chance Wayne the famous Hollywood and Broadway celebrity ? - Really ? - Sure . All bartenders become movie stars . Right , Chance ? Oh , well ... What he's trying to say is that I had your job for too long . You know , I designed that uniform you've got on . I copied it from an outfit Cary Grant wore in this Foreign Legion picture . - Looks great on you , kid . - Really ? But kidding aside , fellas , it is great to be back . Louella Parsons don't answer . She know it's Chance Wayne calling ? Operator ? Yeah , well , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . In New York at the Pla ... Oh , no , he's ... He's in Hollywood .

But they're not always in when you call . Listen , I'm throwing a party tomorrow night . The old crowd , for Princess Kosmonopolis ... Royalty ? - In every way . - Yeah . No , I mean , it's mostly a surprise party for Heavenly . Well , I bet her old man will be plenty surprised . - What time ? - We can't . - Oh , the TV rally . - For Boss Finley . Hey , Jackie .

You're my kind of man . You got ambition , ideas , youth . And the good looks to go with them too . But working in a cocktail bar . Of course , I don't blame you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no elbow room for a go-getter . No opportunity for a man who's going places . Yeah , but Mr . Barnaby , you know , sporting goods ? He promised me this job as a salesman in promotional sales . Small potatoes . Let me tell you something , laddie . This here is America . Today you're nobody tomorrow you're somebody . But you got to think big , act big , and you'll be big . Now , I could set you up myself , but ... No , sir . I wouldn't want that . That's the way . You're my kind of man , laddie . In this world , there's only one payoff window . Number one , the winner , success . Now , that can be you . But a man who's going places he needs a place where he can climb , bust out . A place like New York . Now , this here is the ticket that'll get you there . Train leaves at 9:40 tonight . This night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laddie that you come back to St . Cloud number one , riding high on the hog . Well , laddie . But Heavenly , does she know ? She told me to wish you luck and Godspeed . Well , I know , but I wan na talk to her , sir . We made a lot of plans . I plumb forgot . Heavenly and Aunt Nonnie left for New Orleans this morning taking a boat for Europe . Don't you go forgetting her , now . You keep in touch , laddie , you hear ? Mr . Wayne . Mr . Wayne ! Long distance , Mr . Wayne . They can't find Walter Winchell . This is some secretary named Friday . Hello ? Yeah .

I'll get it , Charles . Hello . Well , who's calling ? Now , listen to me , you lousy son of a ... Boy , you just got a natural talent for being mean and ornery . You want me to like this yellow-bellied ... ? I 'd be grateful if you 'd think for once . What's to think about ? George told me lover-boy came back ... You already told me what George said . But supposing Mr . Wayne didn't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To smear his stink over Heavenly and over me . Isn't that a reason to go and ... ?

Lay out a suit and shirt . I'm going into town tonight . - Yes , sir . - Pa . Get the lead out , boy . Pa , you didn't mean what you said about disowning the Finley Youth Clubs ? After what you did to the professor ? I've got to . Burning books , Halloween masks . You're just plain stupid , boy . Least you could've worn white hoods and burned a cross . - The Klan would've been blamed . - Oh , my . You better stop laughing at nothing or you'll end up in a nuthouse . Without me you wouldn't have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . - Bull . - I got you more headlines than the last campaign ... - You sure did . Once for drunk driving and once for a stag party cost me $5000 to hush it up . Nonnie . Hey , you . Yeah , you . What's Heavenly doing down on the beach alone ? Just trying to be alone , I guess . Sure you ain't arranged a meeting between her and Mr . Wayne ? - No , Tom . - But you did tell her he was back . - Yes , Tom . - Sister-in-law you got a powerful lot to answer for . You favored Chance Wayne encouraged , aided and abetted in his corruption of my baby . That boy never could ... Could never knowingly harm her . You're like your dead sister . Gullible . Hello , honey . I don't like you out here all alone . Why , Papa ? Afraid he might come along ? - Who might come along ? - Oh , Papa . - I'm concerned , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching , Papa . I'm only trying to save my baby from being hurt ever again . How ? By insisting I marry Dr . George Scudder ? And before him , a 50-year-old moneybags you needed for your business ? Me ? Sell my own flesh and blood ? More than once . Remember the Texas oil tycoon ? And the Washington wheel ? All of them rich , all of them important . Every one of them had a powerful feeling for you . There was a time when you could've saved me , Papa by letting me marry Chance , when we were both young and clean . If he loved you so much , why 'd he run off in the first place ? You told him he wasn't good enough . You drove him away to compete with all those big shots . - The point is , he went . - Yes , and he tried . Oh , how he tried . And when the right doors wouldn't open he went in the wrong one's . Oh , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not when I need you . For what , Papa ? What are you planning to use me for now ? Why , honey , ever since your angel mama was took away from me you and your brother are all I got in the world to give my love to . - That doesn't speak well for Miss Lucy . - Who is Miss Lucy ? That certainly doesn't speak well for her . I ain't never heard of no Miss Lucy . You never heard of the woman you keep in a $50-a-day suite of rooms at the Regal Palms Hotel ? That charges her clothes and beauty treatments to your account ? And you say , "" Who is Miss Lucy ? "" Well , keep your love , Papa . Just give me 10 percent of the fortune you spend on this woman you never heard of . - You keep your mouth shut . - You better tell that to Miss Lucy . - You keep your mouth shut . She doesn't speak very well of you , Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . - Who says Miss Lucy says that ? She wrote it with lipstick in the ladies ' room at the hotel bar . Wrote what ? She wrote , "" Boss Finley can't cut the mustard . "" That is a ridiculous lie . Oh , Papa . I know and everyone knows that Miss Lucy was your mistress long before Mama died . I never harmed your mother , as God is my judge . Careful , Papa . Judgment Day might be any day . You listen to me , you ungrateful , hypocritical slut . Last week , in the state capital , when I was speaking on the menace to the chastity of womanhood , a heckler almost caused a riot . You know what he hollered ? "" Hey , Boss Finley , how about your daughter ? How about her chastity ? "" An honest question , Papa . What was your honest answer ? That was my answer . You have got an illusion of power , Boss . I have power , and that is no illusion . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I won't embarrass you any more , Papa . - I'll go away . Tonight , if you like . - You're going nowhere . - You're marrying George Scudder . - No , Papa , I'm not . - We'll discuss it tomorrow . - No . - All right . - Not tomorrow , not ever . All right . Tomorrow night , you're coming to the TV rally with me , missy . You're gon na wear the white of a virgin . You're gon na wear a smile on your face . You're gon na face that crowd and TV audience with pride and defiance . - That's gon na stop all those ugly rumors . - I won't do it . Then you won't . And I'm gon na remove Chance Wayne from your life finally and for the last time . Now , sugar , how do you want him to leave St . Cloud ? In that fishtail Cadillac he come in , or in the garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is yours . Sergeant , get my car out . Did you have another attack , princess ? What was that strange noise ? - Oh , you mean the radio ? - Yes , it frightened me . Well , some more oxygen ? No . No , I must look hideous in it . No , honey . You just ... You just look exotic . Yeah , like a princess from Mars , or a big , magnified insect . Oh , thank you very much . - Well , maybe I ought to call a doctor ? - No . No , no doctors . Get me my robe . When something disturbs me , I just get a little short-winded , that's all . What is this place ? A private hospital ? And you . What are you ? Are you one of those male nurses ? I take care of you , but I'm not your nurse . But you're employed by me , is that it ? For some purpose or other ? - Yep , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , princess ? - Yes , I see . I'm used to footing the bills . Hey . Is your money there ? The jewels accounted for ? I'm looking for a pill . May I have something to wash it down with ? You're not going to give me water . Hello ? Oh , yes , Mr . Hatcher . I'm afraid I made a mistake , Mr . Wayne . Those rooms you're in , they're reserved for the TV rally . Well , I'm sorry too , Mr . Hatcher . You see , Miss Alexandra Del Lago ... - Don't use my name . ... is sound asleep . - But Miss Del Lago is in no con ... - Don't use my name . Ask him how long he intends to stay . - Well , that depends . - Hang up . Well , Mr . Hatcher , you wouldn't wan na bear the responsibility for what might happen to Miss Del Lago if she is ... I said , hang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I only used your name to stop them from evicting us . Will you please shut up ? I'm trying to forget . Forgetting . What are you trying to forget , princess ? What're you trying to hide ? You're all out of focus . Don't I have any glasses ? Where are my glasses ? Well , you had a little accident . - Oh , what was that ? - You fell flat on your face with them on . - Where 'd you put them ? - lf I was in that condition I wouldn't know where anything I had with me was . Or anything I did . By the way , did we do anything ? Mostly you've been knocking yourself out with one thing or another . Did we spend the night together ? Oh , yes , ma'am . But I did not molest you . Well , should I thank you for that or accuse you of cheating ? I like you . You are a nice monster . Well , I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't mind waking up in an intimate situation with someone but I do like to see who it is . So I can make whatever adjustment seems called for . Well . I may have done better but God knows I have done worse . Do you remember where we met ? Well , this much I do remember : That I like bodies to be silky-smooth , hard gold . - Do you remember where we met ? - No . - And the circumstances ? - No . All I remember is us driving through a town called Tallahassee . - And before that ? - That water . Is that the Pacific Ocean ? No , ma'am , that's the gulf . What gulf ? The gulf of misunderstanding between you and me . - It's not that funny . - Oh , yes , it is . That's exactly what Bennie Taubman said to me . "" Sweetie , sweetie , "" he said ... - No more gulfs between you and I . - Bennie . This comeback will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I'm worried , Bennie . You leave the worrying to me . Excuse us for a minute . You've been a top star for 15 years . You've got millions of fans . Loyal , devoted . Devoted to the way I used to be , the way I used to look . Bennie , I am scared . - You ? Never . - Miss Del Lago ! You're a professional , an artist , a personality . Alexandra Del Lago is the sex symbol of America . - Say , Charlie , how about it ? - She's coming . - Thank you . - Playback . Get me a little something , will you ? - God , no . - What's the matter ? I remembered the thing I wanted to forget . The stupid , senseless end of my life , that's all . No wonder I didn't want to remember . I was no fool . - You want some oxygen ? - No . Where is it ? Where is the stuff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . Those pills aren't any good . It's right here . Well , that is a brilliant place to put it . Hotel maid sometimes do clean under mattresses , you know . Wouldn't that be pretty ? A year in one of those model prisons for distinguished addicts . This is pretty high-class pot . Where 'd you get it ? You beautiful , stupid young man . That is not pot . It's hashish . Moroccan , and the finest . Pop star . It's insanity . The legend of Alexandra Del Lago was ... Was youth . I was right . I told him I was right . Why ... ? Why didn't I trust my instincts ? They've stood me in good stead for many , many a year . Where does one retire to ? There is no place to retire to when you retire from the movies . No place except oblivion . One thing that'll help you forget oblivion is ... This . It's this . If I had just been old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just wasn't young . Not young . I just wasn't young anymore . Nobody's young anymore . Stars in retirement sometimes give acting lessons . They give beauty hints , they write gossip columns . Princess , just smoke . Oh , yes . Smoke . And after this the mercenary young lovers . - Like me ? - Yes , like you . Your comeback . I mean , what happened ? You just didn't have it anymore ? Oh , I had it . I had the will and I had the talent to go with it . But the camera . The camera doesn't know how to lie . The screen is a very clear mirror . There is a thing , God help us , called a close-up . Camera number one in position . Finish your candles , there , boys . Playback . The camera dollies in . And you , your head , your face are caught in the frame with the lights blazing . And all your terrible history screams while you smile . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it . I told you I want a shadow right here on her neck . You understand ? Not your fault , sweetie . You're terrific . Okay , Charlie . We go again . Right now . - Camera , number one position . - Playback . - Quiet . - All right , places , everybody . And then , before you know it , comes the night of the preview . The first part of the film , I felt so safe . - What did you say her name was ? - Alexandra Del Lago , stupe . I thought she was dead and buried . Sweetie , wait . Believe me . Please . Miss Del Lago , one more picture , please . She fell . Oh , poor thing . - She's drunk . - They're all drunks , all of them . After that , flight . Running away from that frightful comeback . I never stopped running until now . - Know what you need right now ? - Yes , to forget again . First we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we apply the magic formula . What ? Like we did in Palm Beach , remember ? That soothing , magical formula called papaya cream . Yes . Yes . Papaya-cream rubs . Were you one of those faceless young bodies in Palm Beach ? Well , that's where we met . Don't you remember , in your private cabana , on the beach ? And you were breathless . I mean , just like you are right now . It was painful . Painful to see . And you were the anesthetic that eased my pain . Yeah , and you were smoking . Just like you are right now . That feels so ... I don't remember your face , but your hands are familiar . There . That hash , how 'd you get hooked ? On my way to Europe , running away from my comeback . The ship's doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the States , smuggle it ? Know another way ? You mean you smuggled it right past customs , princess ? What are you trying to prove ? Nothing . No , I just ... Don't forget , you're the one that introduced me to this fine old Moroccan hash . Boy , I doubt very much if I have any vice old or new , that I could introduce to you . - Ma'am , don't call me boy . - You knew all about this stuff , Carl . - My name is not Carl , it's Chance . - You called yourself Carl in Palm Beach . I always carry an extra name in my pocket . Why , are you a criminal ? No , ma'am , not me . I mean , you're the one that's committed a federal crime . What 'd you do that for ? I thought you might've planted someone outside the door . Don't you trust me ? Who taught you to rub desperate ladies the right way ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Well , more or less . - How much more ? Ma'am , if we 'd made love , you 'd have remembered it . Well , what stopped you ? Certainly not I . And certainly not your ethics . What's the angle ? Why did you hold out ? I held out till you signed a contract . Well , evidently I signed . Why did you still hold out ? - I wanted to hold your interest . - Well , you miscalculated . My interest always increases with satisfaction . You mean you don't intend to live up to that contract ? I can get out of that contract any time I want to . - Do you have any talent ? - For what ? Acting , baby . Acting . A contract for acting implies that you are an actor . Are you ? I've been an extra in movies long enough to know that I can be as big a star as some of them she-men that have made it . Princess . Princess ? All I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes more than one break . - Chance . Chance . Chance Wayne . - You're stoned . - Baby , there is no easy way to the top . You can forget about magic formulas and trick contracts . Forget about this false dream . Okay , say it , princess . What is it you want ? Come here . Let's comfort each other a little . That's right . Princess ? You know something , honey ? That all that talk about narcotics it's been recorded on tape . - Where did you get that thing ? - You bought it for me in Palm Beach . To improve my diction . - comeback . The ship ' s doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish came later . In Tangier . - Blackmail , is it ? - That's very ugly language . The language of the gutter is understood by anyone who ever fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to this contract . - And that's not all . - Money ? - And if I refuse ? - Well , you won't . You wouldn't want the FBI to get ahold of these recordings . - Chance . - Or the newspapers and those bigshot columnists ? And the dirt magazines ? Princess , you got a big name to protect . You still got a reputation . I had , baby , I had . I have been blackmailed by experts . I hate to think what desperation has made you think that you can try to intimidate me . Me , Alexandra Del Lago , with this ridiculous ... Oh , Chance , it's silly . It's so silly , it's touching . It's downright endearing . Makes me feel close to you . Now , I got ta see somebody . I want some cash and I want your car . Here . Here . Now , you 'd better start signing these traveler's checks , or I'll ... Or what ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When monster meets monster , one monster has to give way and it will never be me . Now , then , signed checks are payment . Delivery comes first . I have only one way to forget the things that I don't want to remember and that way is through making love . It's the only dependable distraction , and I need that distraction right now . In the morning , we'll talk about what you want and what you need . Aren't you ashamed a little ? Yes . Aren't you ? More than a little . Close the curtains , please . Then come here to me . And make me almost believe that we are a pair of young lovers without any shame . Two things , Pa . First , he's bedding in with a broken-down old movie star , Alexandra Del Lago . But she's still famous and capable of causing us trouble ... Second , Mr . Wayne don't show any inclination to move on . I told him she's not well enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every newspaper's gon na be down here . But if we separate Mr . Wayne from his lady we could proceed more directly , if it was necessary . Right , sir . You're the doctor , call an ambulance . - Haul queenie to the hospital . - Without her permission ? Say she's contagious . Bubonic plague , typhoid fever . - I'm not gon na let you involve me in this . - Lower your voice . - He's not gon na involve me in this ... - Doctor , laddie you are already involved right up to your scrofulous chicken neck . I've done anything you ever asked me . Anything . But one public mistake , one slip , and we ... Laddie , you've got all the symptoms of a nervous breakdown . Now , my prescription for you is a weekend vacation . A change of scenery to build up your backbone . I 'd say you're sickly . Critical . Might be even terminal . So you 'd better leave quick . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Yes , sir . - Happy Easter , Fly . - Thank you , sir . - Happy Easter . - Thank you , governor . - Shall I ring her , say you're coming up ? - No . Lucy ? Lucy ? Hiya , honey . I'll be with you in a second . How can you watch two TVs , chop your toenails stuff yourself with chocolates all at the same time ? I already seen the movie . Shut that damn thing off . I said , shut it ... ! My , my , my . Ain't we in a mood . Guess what I got for you , for an Easter present . I went all the way to New Orleans for it . Close your eyes , lover . This is a mighty exciting surprise . Don't look . Like ? Is that for me ? Well , I surely don't intend to give it to anybody else . Oh , feast your tired old eyes , daddy doll . I sure do hope that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . For me ? You'll spoil me yet , honey . Oh , why , it's lovely . It's a lovely Easter egg . Am I supposed to eat it ? Open the top . It sure takes a powerful kind of rooster to lay this kind of egg . Oh , darling , you shouldn't have . Why not ? You deserve everything you get . Oh , I'm so nervous . Like it , sugar baby ? It's absolutely divine . It's heavenly . That's better . Now you go downstairs to the ladies ' room of the cocktail lounge and you write on the toilet mirror with this same lipstick : "" Miss Lucy is available to any punk's got $5 and can cut the mustard . "" You know , I don't very much like my Easter surprise . Hello ? Operator , did you get the Finley residence yet ? Aunt Nonnie ? Well , can you talk now ? Well , can I see you , then ? Well , I can ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll meet you there . Aunt Nonnie , whatever it is that happened , I can explain . And listen I got it made . No , I really got it made . All right . Princess ? Princess ? Pure , hard gold , all right . Yeah . Well , I'm glad you're appreciative but , you know , I'm going out pretty soon and my credit is kind of shaky . I would like to smoke , please . No , no . Just one of the ordinary cigarettes that only give you cancer . What are those lovely bells ? Why , madam , it is Easter Sunday . How fitting . I feel absolutely reborn . Yes . The world and I are on very good terms this morning . Yeah , well , we made a little bargain last night , remember ? Oh , yes . Well , I will live up to my end of the bargain after I have put on my face . The face I face the world with , baby . Will you open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'re afraid of ? Oh , no , ma'am . The thing I want most in the world is out there . This town belonged to me once . And will again . Were you born here ? - On the wrong side of the tracks , but ... - Well , most of us were , baby . You know , the set that I ran with was a snob set . You know , they had family , big names , big money . - All I had was ... - Beauty . Say it . What you had was beauty . I had it , and I say it with pride . Yeah . Well , the others were born satisfied . Well , I had to get something better . And I did . I got it . While my friends were doing the conventional things like flunking out of state university I appeared in the biggest stage hit on Broadway . I had my picture on the cover of LIFE magazine . And , at the same time I was employing my other talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever truly meant for . I've wallowed in a social register of New York with discreet wives in the millionaire set and debutante daughters in the horsy set . Did they foot the bills too ? Yeah . But I always gave them much more than I took . To older women , I gave back a feeling of excitement and youth . To sad , lost women a merciful display of affection and temporary hope . Eccentrics ? Understanding , tolerance . You must have been quite a successful enterprise . - Oh , I was going places . - Where ? Successville . My name was appearing in columns I was promised this part in a big Broadway play Hollywood was nibbling . I was getting to be somebody . Then it was time for me to come home for my girl take her away with me , like I promised . And when I came home , oh , man . This town just buzzed with excitement . Chance . She never asked about the others . Well , she didn ' t have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done to could ever cancel out our love , the pleasure we gave each other . You know , the big difference between people is not between rich and poor or good and evil . The biggest of all differences between people is between those that have had pleasure in love and those that haven't . We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from Washington . It was officially announced that United States ground forces entered the Korean War today . President Truman termed the intervention a police action . And I am positive there's no finer , no braver , no more patriotic man to lead our Dixie Regiment than our own hometown boy Chance Wayne . Congratulations . All I could think was , "" This stops everything . "" Just when things were going great the end . Period . Even if I was lucky , I 'd have to start all over again . You and a few million others . Their jobs would be waiting for them , but my trade was youth . And war either makes you age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of hopes and dreams and ambitions being wiped out by a 2-ounce accident like a bullet . A bullet shot off into space by anybody . And my head and that bullet at the same place at the same time . Only , it wasn't a bullet that got me , it was my nerves . A month in a hospital , a medical discharge . And when I came home that time , there was no parties , no banners no picture in the newspaper . - So you ran away again . - Yeah . And I finally made it to Hollywood . And failed again . That time . But not this time . Princess . Now , I've got a few things to iron out right now . But tonight you give this big press conference , see ? You know , to tell the world about this new discovery you signed up . The last thing I want is publicity . I know , but this will prove that young talent is your real interest in life . Which it certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is me , Alexandra Del Lago . Besides , a movie starring our special talent would be banned in all 50 states , censored worldwide . Princess , I am taking your car . - Well , when will I see you ? - Wait here . I don't like waiting for anybody . Baby . Morning , Miss Finley . What is it , sergeant ? Nothing , miss . Just sort of spying ? No , ma'am . Just sort of watching over you . Easter must be a very dangerous time . Guess so , miss . - The ladies ready for church ? - Miss Nonnie's already gone , sir . - She took a taxi . - I see . - She get any calls this morning ? - The phone rang . She talked to somebody . No , sir , Mr . Finley . I don't know who to . Get my Bible . Good morning . Nice morning , Mr . Finley . Thank you , laddie . You look mighty sweet , sugar . I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like you to behave like a daughter should . Well , did you meditate on Mr . Wayne's future ? At the present , he is enjoying life in the loving arms of a famous Hollywood siren . Hey , Pa , if Chance is living with a real princess does that make him royalty too ? It makes him what he always was : A criminal degenerate and parasite . Oh , I see . Chance ? She never blamed you for anything . She always had ... Nothing . I gave her nothing , Aunt Nonnie . She lived lonely and she died lonely . Gee , I'm glad to see you . I came here to tell you one thing . Well , I was sort of hoping that you 'd bring Heavenly . Go away before it's too late . Before her father ... Why won't they let me see her , Aunt Nonnie ? Because she and George ... ? - I can't talk about it . - Why ? Why ? Now , why , Aunt Nonnie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please help me , Aunt Nonnie . You were always able to ... See , you were like a mother to me . You always called me son . Why did you stop calling me son ? Oh , Chance , go away before it's too late . I am not leaving here till I talk to Heavenly or see her . Now , you tell her that . Aunt Nonnie , I got a right . Goodbye , son . Aunt Nonnie . - Aunt Nonnie , I'm taking you to church . - No , Chance . I'm afraid . Afraid for you . Take your sister on in . - Happy Easter . - Happy Easter , mayor . Well , look here . Glad to see you , laddie . Hold it , Mr . Finley . Thank you , sir . It's no use , Mr . Finley , I ... Laddie , I hear you're consorting with a genuine princess . Guess that sort of makes you a prince , don't it ? Happy Easter , Mrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finley . I once had a dog called Prince . I had to butcher him to keep all the bitches in town from being violated . Deacon , I'm counting on your support at the rally . - Up , the rebels ! - Let's see , now . - When did you last visit us ? - Why won't you let me see her , sir ? I remember , you hit town last time in a freight car . You saw my daughter then and you left her carrying your bastard then too . Let you see her ? Sure , prince , when I've had you taken care of like my dog . I remember , you hit town last time in a freight car . No , I'll get you dirty . Hold me . Just hold me . Hold me . What are you thinking ? I was just ... I was just feeling kind of peaceful and easy listening to those freewheeling birds coming home . If we could just be like one of them out there , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free or even wants to be . You know what I was thinking ? About those five days and nights on those freight cars . Thinking that , "" Heavenly will make me feel clean again . She'll wash away all the ... "" What's it like in movie land ? Oh , it is like no place in this world , baby . In fact , it's not even a place , it's a state of mind with a stone wall around it a mile high . "" Strange birds , keep out . "" No , it's the strange one's that get in . I know . Why , I've been clawing away at that wall for over a year now , trying to get on the inside . This last year's been ... - Wasted ? - No . No , just a run of bad breaks , back-to-back . Nothing's wasted that teaches you how to operate , how to beat the game . Last year's the best investment I ever made . Oh , next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m gon na take you with me right through that stone wall , first class , straight to the top . Again , Chance ? I got the key now , baby . I got the know-how . That Hollywood merry-go-round is a pushover . Today they're stepping on your feet , tomorrow they're kissing your feet . I know , I have seen it . Well that merry-go-round is gon na carry me . It's gon na carry me all the way . And then before you know it , before you know it I'm gon na have that brass ring , that lucky brass ring right here . - Which gets you what ? - It gets you the prize honey , money , success , happiness . No . All the brass ring gets you is a free ride on a wooden horse that's going nowhere except up and down and round and round . My papa sold you that phony dream and you're still buying it . How does he say it ? "" All you need is one lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the jackpot . "" Anyone can be a millionaire , so everybody's got to try it . That's right . And why not ? There are a lot of ways you can make it , and for me there is one quick way . Now , just stick with me , baby , and when I come back next time ... - Another next time . - No , this time I got a job . I got a big job in Palm Beach mixing with all kinds of important people . Take me with you . Please . No , I can't , baby . Not yet . You know , in this job , I got ta travel fast . And I got ta travel alone . This is the job , baby . This is the job that's gon na get me inside that magic door . All my life , I've been on the outside . And time is running out .

We'll find something . Baby , I can't . Have you forgotten what's expected of me ? I want you as you are . Then look at me as I am . I'm a nothing . A nobody . I couldn't write a check for $2 without getting arrested . Busted . Flat broke . I'm ashamed to go home and let my mother look at me . I always dreamed of coming back here like a ... Oh , like ... Don't ask me to give up my dream . Excuse me . Supposing he comes over , Pa . Well , sugar , it's up to you . Let him alone . I'll be there with you tonight .

Chance ? Long who ? Long distance ? There is no Alexandra Del Lago here , operator . Who is it ? I am not ... ! Operator , I ought to know who I am . Just a minute .

May I ask you what Mr . Wayne is to you ? You may not . He's ... He drives my car . He's in my employ . He's my driver . What are you doing here in St . Cloud ? Okay , he brought you here . Why ? We're just passing through . - That's all . - Well , fine . Just pass right on through . But you tell that scum to drive you out of here quick . - On whose authority ? - Mine . Well , even in this impossible place , you couldn't represent the law . There isn't any law that covers the Chance Waynes . Not after what he did to me and to my family . - What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Never you mind . You tell him that I said if he don't pass through his life ain't worth spit in the wind .

I had a visitor , looking for you . He was a horrible , vicious young man with evil in his heart . And he said that if we weren't out of town by nightfall , he 'd ... Oh , Chance , I didn't know where to find you . And at first I felt panicky , and then I got a little high again . - I'm sorry . - Look , I know , princess but I got ta go now . - Oh , Chance .

Honey , get the bill ready for suite 212 . - Miss Lucy , your bill's been paid in full . - That's what you think . - Hold on . - Tom Jr . , they're checking out . The princess lady just asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him , didn't you ? You just naturally had to lay in Chance Wayne's arms like a trollop . Folks , my daughter ! Who says purity and politics don't go together ? Well ! I thought , from the happy celebration that you were being served on a platter with an apple stuck in your mouth . - What are you doing ? - Getting out of here . - As fast as your car will take us . - Oh , well . I have another driver . A certain Miss Lucy . A kindly soul who will drive me out of this hellish nightmare as far as New Orleans . I'm still your driver , princess . We're leaving here together . What happened to your unfinished business ? Floppola ? - Well , I'm back . Isn't that enough ? - In a word , no . - Oh , princess , baby ... - No ! Don't answer that . Chance ! - Hello ? - I told you not to . - Who's calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? It's Walter Winchell , in Hollywood . Oh , no . - Oh , no . - Yeah , put him on . - No . No ! - Yeah , she's right here . Oh , how did he find me ? How ? - It was you . - Hello ? Hello , Mr . Winchell ? Oh , yes . Well , this is Chance Wayne speaking . I called for the Princess Kosmonopolis . Alexandra ... ! I mean , Alexandra Del Lago . Last night ? Oh , yeah . She's fine , fine . She just wanted to tell you about this new star that she's discovered . - Oh , sure , she can talk for herself . - I can't . - Princess , come on . He's waiting . - Well , you tell him that I am dying . And I just might . You got ta meet it halfway . Princess ? Walter ? Walter ? Walter ! Well , is that really you , Waldo ? Yes , yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . Walter ? Oh , yes , yes , I did go to the preview , but I only stayed a few minutes . As soon I saw that first big close-up of myself on that monstrous CinemaScope I tell you , I ran right out of there ! I screamed for a taxi , and I haven't been ... I haven't stopped running since . What ? Oh , no , no . No , no , I heard nothing , read nothing , I just wanted oblivion . What ? Walter . You're just being kind , aren't you ? Princess , tell him about my screen test . - One moment , Walter , I'm breathless . - Tell him to break it in his column ... Go in the bathroom and stick your head under cold water . Walter , now , tell me , do you really think so ? You're not just being kind , are you , because of old times ? Grown , did you say ? My talent ? Well , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about me . - More what ? What did you say ? - Me . More power ? - Well , God bless you . God bless you ! - Come on , now , cut the chatter . Tell him you've found a new leading man with a bright new future . Walter , that is very , very sweet of you . I don't even care if you're not altogether sincere in that statement , Walter because I think you know what the past 15 years have been like . What ? What's that , Walter ? They want me ? They really want me ? Well , for what part ? Who ? Who wants me ? Oh , dear Lord . Walter ! Walter , please excuse me . No , no . Excuse me . I'm crying , dear , and I haven't got any Kleenex . Come on , talk to him about me . - Oh , Walter ... - Me , me , me ! Walter , what ? No , no , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers say ? What did they say ? Tell me . Tell me word for word . Before the festivities , let us all bow our heads in silent prayer . Mrs . Maribelle Norris will sing while we pray . Good night , professor . Can't we do this without hurting the girl ? Do you wan na get rid of Boss Finley or not ? Yes . Oh , no ! Oh , Walter , the New Yorker magazine praised it . Oh , I'm too overwhelmed . I'm ... Walter , I'll have to call you back later . - I can't believe it . I can't believe it . - Hello ? My picture has broken box-office records in New York and L.A . - Get him back on this phone . - Variety says that I am the biggest boff in release today . - Princess , I took care of you . - I've got ta go to a clinic for a week . - I delivered my end . - A week or 10 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll have to get him to cover up my tracks these past few weeks in hell . - Get Winchell back on this phone . - What ? Tell him about me ! What ? Tell him about a beach boy that I picked up for pleasure a distraction from panic ? Now ? Now , when the nightmare is over ? And involve my name with the name of a ... A blackmailer . You've just been using me . Using me . When you ran out on me downstairs , you ran out on this contract too . Just a short while ago , I needed you . Oh , how I needed you . Well , now I need nobody . I climbed up alone . And I will climb back alone . Back to where I belong . I will live alone and I will work alone . I know exactly the kind of gold-plated hell I'm going to . But you , you have gone past something you couldn't afford to go past . Your time , your youth . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you've had it ! Look who's talking . Just look at yourself . What do you see in there ? I see me . Alexandra Del Lago , artist and star . Now you look at yourself . What do you see ? What ? A nameless face , that's what you see . Oh , I remember faces like yours . I remember young men with dreams like yours . I remember their eyes , I remember their voices I remember their smiles , I remember their bodies . But their names , their names have gone . They're just nameless bodies . Well , you remind me of one in particular . What was his name ? Franz something . Franz , Franz ... - Albertzart . Yes , Franz Albertzart . - Are you through ? Have you finished ? I saw Franz a few years later in Monte Carlo . He was with a woman of 70 , and his eyes were older than hers . But she held him . She led him by an invisible chain through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedient lap dog . Chance Wayne is Franz Albertzart . Oh , no . Look , I'm not Franz anybody . Princess , I'm your next leading man . Princess , now , look , you've got ta open the right doors for me . I know you're gon na do this for me . I have been knocking on those doors of success till my insides are bloody . That's how I've been knocking on those doors , with my bare insides . You will open only one door : The door to my car as my chauffeur . You will wake me in the morning as my butler or my lover , depending on what I want . In a few years , you will be through with your good looks and I will be through with you . And that is the truth . Can you face the truth ? Are you ready to be my chauffeur ? My next Franz Albertzart ? Oh , don't you know I would die first ? I would . I would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Lord protect him . Our Tom . I am here to answer charges against my good name and character . Thirty years ago , the voice of God told me to save this sweet land from pollution . Well , I am here on the same sacred mission tonight . To save us from outsiders who wan na corrupt our way of life . Boss Finley ! Hey , Boss Finley ! What way of life you talking about ? You mean the way your daughter ... The way your virtuous Miss Heavenly had a secret operation at the hands of Dr . Scudder ? - What are you waiting for ? An illegal operation , performed in your hospital . Aided and abetted by you . - And forced on her without her consent . - That is a dirty , black lie ! - Did God tell you how to rob us blind ? - Show yourself ! - Listen to me , folks ! - How to use your office for gain ? - Listen to me ! - Come on , get him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and country . My life is an open book . Listen to me , folks ! Folks , listen to me ! Chance , we're leaving . Right now . Together . Murderer ! Baby killer ! I'm going to send a boy up for my luggage . You had better come down with my luggage . - I am not part of your luggage . - Chance . Whatever I am , I am not part of your luggage . All right . You know what's going to happen to you if you stay . Goodbye . Chance . Chance , dear , I ... Well , it's ... - You forget something , princess ? - Well , yes . Yes , I did . - These , maybe ? - Oh , yes . Of course , last night they were worthless but now , after my comeback you know , they're worth a small jackpot . - In cash . - On the house . Chance . Please , let me help you . - Goodbye , lover . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good luck . - I'll wait for you in the car . Princess , each of us has his own private hell to go to . - Find your sister . - Take it easy , Pa . She'll run off with that punk . - No , he's gone . Checked out . - That won't stop her . Will you let me handle this ? Mr . Finley . How would you answer the charges ... ? I am shocked , shocked , to find our state overrun by backstabbing Bolsheviki and Red rabble-rousers . Get the governor on the phone . Are you aware it was the Finley Youth Club hoodlums that started that riot ? What riot ? I'm only aware that decent Americans were defending freedom of speech which I have yet to receive the benefit of . Oh , Miss Finley , would you care to make a statement ? - Miss Finley ? - Hasn't enough been said already ? Sure , Aunt Nonnie , folks will think we got something to hide . Sugar ? Heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You came here of your own free will and I hereby give you just as much freedom to speak your piece , right now . Take me home , Papa . Good night , folks . Good night , you-all . Heavenly ! Heavenly ! Mr . Chance , it's me , Charles . Don't stay here , Mr . Chance . Don't ! Don't stay here . Please , Mr . Chance , don't stay here now . Heavenly ! Well , lookie here . Thought you 'd be halfway to California by now with that tramp actress of yours . Heavenly ! Don't you ever speak the name of my sister again . Heavenly ... Heavenly ! - Don't you know ? - Kill him . No . Just gon na take away lover-boy's meal ticket . Put him down there . Chance ? Chance . Bring him over here . Look at yourself . No woman will ever again pay to love that . - Chance ? - Go in the house . Hello ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor calling . - Chance ? - Hello , governor . How's the family ? - Fine , fine . - Night , Aunt Nonnie . Oh , baby , what did we do to you ? Don't cry . Don't cry , baby . It's all right . It's all right . What you heard was lies . Just lies . The press will be here in a moment . I want you here with me to answer questions . He sure busted up that dream of mine . We're leaving . We're leaving here right now . My daughter will be here to answer any and all questions . Heavenly ! Get in the house ! Go . Papa , I'm never coming into that house again . Wait . Hold it , governor . I'll call you back . Come back here ! Come back ! - Nonnie , she can't leave here . Not now . - Why ? - Me . What about me ? - You ? You can go straight to hell . @ @ @ @ @ @

Oui , oui . Et pensez-vous que la campagne est plus tranquille que la ville ? Par exemple . Oui , mais pas assez excitante . - Uh , quand j'ai venu ici ... - Quand je suis venue . Oh , gosh . How many times have I made that mistake ? It's common among my pupils . It's what they most often get wrong . Oh , what's the difference ? If and when I ever get to visit Paris again , I'll have long forgotten all my French . - I must be going . - No ! Stay . It's still early . - I mean , what are you gon na do at home ? - Nothing special . Right . I mean , how many times can you putter around the garden ? God ! I can't believe my mother . She's out there ... She's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write her biography . Her stupid life . "" As told to . "" Oh , come on , now . She'll be gone in a couple of days . Yeah , that's what you said last week . Time passes and she's still here . Oh , look at this . She will not stop picking the flowers , which I asked her not to do . She doesn't even put them in water , so of course they die . Walking around in a snit is not gon na make the time go any faster . When I ask Peter if he wants to go for a drive or walk , he's busy writing his novel . But he's got plenty of time to stroll around the lake with her . - You must admit she tells funny stories . - See ? Men . She certainly hasn't lost her knack . - Somehow I thought Peter 'd be different . - Lane , it's your mother . - Is that when you dated Errol Flynn ? - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , I met him when I was 16 . For Errol , 15 was over the hill . Lane , I invited the Richmonds for drinks tonight . I thought we might have a party . What did you do that for ? Peter and I were supposed to see the new Kurosawa film . - Sorry . Why didn't you say something ? - I did . That's OK . We can catch it another night . OK , but it's only there tonight . - Where was I ? - How we met . Oh ! It was like a bad movie . We both hailed the same taxicab . - We shared a cab and fell in love . - And I know nothing about physics . - So what did you talk about ? - Talk ? By the time the meter hit $3 ... - .. she had her tongue in my ear . - Oh ! Lloyd ! How nice . I drop in to visit my daughter and she has a writer renting her cottage . I'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure-fire bestseller . I know . I remember reading about your exploits in the paper . You're too young , but anything , whatever your dad read , it's all true . No , I remember your picture in the long defunct New York Journal-American ... .. with an actor named Jeff Chandler , who you dated . What a memory . What a memory ! That was Palm Beach ! I love Palm Beach ! That's where Lloyd and I were heading when I decided to stop off to see Lane . Um ... I hadn't seen her , you know , since she ... took the pills . God , that had to be six , eight months ago . Boy , what some people will do for love . Or the lack of it . Of course , I understand . I mean , if you've never had something ... .. and then you experience it and then it's taken away ... Wow . Poor kid . Try and stroke the ball to the rhythm of the music . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the music's so fast . - Keep it rhythmic , and keep your eye ... Steffie , Mrs Mason thinks she's got me an offer on the house . That's great . Congratulations . Two . Not great . But , after everything's paid off , ... .. there 'd be something to put a down payment on an apartment in New York . I can get two for mine , and it's half your acreage . Well , I can't really afford to be choosy . At least I have a customer . I think . I hope , at least . Don't give it away . I can lend you what you need . No , Howard . Oh , God , no . Thank you , though . No . You've been ... You've been incredible to me through all this , ... - .. but I've got ta try and get my own life ... - What can you do in New York ? I don't know . I ... Maybe my photography again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I don't know . It's awful , isn't it , at my age to be floundering around so ? I just ... I don't know what I want . A child . I 'd love to have a child . Lane , did you , by any chance , finish those chapters I gave you ? - Yeah , almost . They're wonderful . - I thought about them . I'm discouraged . - You shouldn't be . You're wrong . - I just wan na start over , again . You can't tear up everything you write , you know . Otherwise of course you have to take tranquillisers to calm down . It seems so futile . I was supposed to be finished by now . Next week is Labor Day . I have to be back at my job the day after . If you wouldn't let my mother seduce you ... Now , her life would make a fascinating book . Why ? What's so fascinating about her frivolous existence ? That she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... .. for a gangster who beat her up ? You think that's compelling ? Was it the shooting ? That wasn't fascinating . That was pathetic . Maybe it's that she's a survivor , and the book I'm writing is about surviving . You're right . She went on with her life , but I get stuck with the nightmares . Excuse me . Uh ... Diane wanted some ice cubes and you seem to be out . Um , there's a ... there's an ice machine just outside the back door . And you're wrong to think your mother didn't suffer terribly over that whole affair . Right . Poor thing She experienced a little hearing loss in her left ear from the gunshot . Noise trauma . The only point I wanted to make - and I didn't mean to upset you - .. is that some people are survivors and some let life's tragedies annihilate them . - This is just one of the cruelties of living . - And in your book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who kills her mother's lover is ... sleazy . And the trial was sleazy and he was sleazy . And my mother was completely unconcerned . I'm sorry . I'm sorry . I'll get you those pages . And they're good , you know , despite what you think . I won't let you tear them up . - Very good . I'm very impressed . - You liked that ? Oh ! I didn't know you were a pool player . Now you know . Did you ever get a chance to play that record I got you ? Yeah . Yeah , I did . I play it all the time . It's so beautiful . I was just listening to it last night . Somehow I knew you 'd like it . Did I hear you say your book was about survival ? Yeah , well , it's not really about survival . It's about , you know . It's about everything . Oh , really ? Like the Encyclopaedia Britannica . Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard , it's so unlike you to be rude . We don't need another book on survival . We already have the Boy Scout manual . Lane says he's talented . Well , if he's such a hotshot , why's he wasting his life on Madison Avenue ? It's because writing beer and deodorant ads is more within his grasp . I'm surprised at you . You're the kindest man , ... .. and you can't bring yourself to say one good word about Peter . He's OK . I don't mean he's a bad person . But I can't stand that Lane gets so moonstruck over his line . - I mean , she blushes when he's around . - Now you sound jealous . What's the difference ? She's going away anyhow . I knew that was bothering you . If you could have seen her at the beginning of the year when she came up . She was in such bad shape . She needed someone to take care of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend long afternoons together , ... .. winter evenings listening to music . It was such a pleasure watching her gain strength and begin to enjoy things more . I remember one night I was home alone after we 'd seen a movie together ... .. and I noticed that I missed her and I couldn't wait to see her the next day . And that's when I realised I never wanted her to leave here . - Oh , Howard . - Thank you . I never said anything . I knew she was through a terrible time and not over it . I didn't think she was ready to hear that someone had become ... .. dependent on her . I didn't want to ... I didn't want to say anything that would frighten her or cause her any confusion . Well , after all , I am much older than she is . So in the end I hedged and procrastinated and ... obsessed over her . And over the right moment to speak . Next thing I knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who suddenly started occupying all her time . Well , ... .. one can see how having Peter on the premises , just ... - - .. just the two of them for seven weeks , ... .. how she could fall very much in love . Never thought I could feel this way after Karen died . Hello ? Steffie ! It's your husband . He says it's important . Lane's changed towards me . She used to get such a kick out of me . She used to laugh at my jokes and tell me how pretty I looked . She's become so angry . What do you think , honey ? This or the pink one , with the jacket ? - This one . - You're the boss . Hey . Hey ! Come here . Where you goin ' , huh ? Boy , oh boy ! Am I lucky I hailed that taxi ! You're the only man I've known worth marrying since Lane's father . The others were just nothin ' ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to marry ' em , I said no . - I'm the lucky one . - You , lucky ? You inherited a machine that's grinding to a halt . Between my ulcers and my gall bladder and my angina ... The whole is greater than the sum of the parts . Remember ? Hm ? Said the bishop to the showgirl . - Sorry . - No , come in . - You wanted to borrow this pin ? - Oh , yeah . But I've decided on a whole other outfit so I don't think I'll need it . - It's lovely . Where 'd you get it ? - You gave it to me . I did ? What taste ! - Doesn't Diane look stunning ? - She looks great . Try to have a good time tonight . You don't wan na turn into a recluse . I just really didn't feel up to having people over tonight . You have to learn to put the past behind you . What's done is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to go to the movies with Peter . Is he a good writer ? I mean , seriously , could he write my biography ? - Oh , Mom , don't be foolish . - Foolish ? I've been offered good money . Peter's trying to write a serious book . You shouldn't be distracting him . God , he's always asking me millions of questions . I don't think your memoirs are something you wan na make public . Really ? I'm not ashamed of my life . Your mother was offered quite an advance . Then she should find somebody else to write it . And leave me and Dad out of it . I can't leave you out of it . That's the part everybody's interested in . You're exploiting an ugly situation . You've become so touchy lately . I mean , if your life hasn't worked out , stop blaming me for it . Take the bull by the horns . Make something happen . I'm sorry . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have remarkable energy . You were such a promising young girl , so bright , and you had my looks . Well , you had better bone structure than I did , but you lacked my height . And you had your father's intelligence . You got ta do something about all that . I mean , you're young , you're lovely . Of course , you dress like a Polish refugee . I don't feel too attractive these days . Peter thinks you're beautiful . And he's right . - Does he ? - He sings your praises . He's probably just being polite . You really like him , don't you ? - I don't know . - You've got ta be a little cool about it . - You shouldn't let your desperation show . - I don't think I have . I always felt there was a fatal element of hunger in your last affair . That's not true . I don't think Jeff would have run quite so quickly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain pressure . I sensed it . His name was Jack . And you were never here , so you don't know what happened . Darling , don't be so defensive . I base this observation on the time I saw you together . And I'm not saying anything different than those high-priced psychiatrists have said . When it comes to men , you're probably doing something to stand in your way . - I probably am . - Yeah . Well , this is out . Looks like I'm going to a luau ! Oh , my God . Look at me . I got ta redo my whole make-up . It's hell , gettin ' older . Especially when you feel 21 inside . All the strengths that sustain you all through your life ... .. just vanish one by one . And you study your face in the mirror and you ... You notice something is missing . And then you realise it's your future . So that's ... That's why I want you to find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . - Hi . - Hi . - I guess I'm early . - The guests haven't arrived yet . Well , you look wonderful , all dressed up . It's starting to rain . Maybe it'll cool things off . Let's hope . Well , you look lovely . I said that ! Thank you . - Did you know the , um ... - Steffie ... - Sorry . What were you gon na say ? - No . What ? - You looked like you were ... - No , nothing . Thunder's getting close . Yeah . So , who's the history professor ? The history professor ? How did you know about that ? Did we talk about that ? Well , you mentioned to me one time that that might be the title of your book . The history professor was my father . He taught at a college in Connecticut and he ... .. he was fired during the McCarthy era . He was blacklisted . He had to do all kinds of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by playing poker and betting the horses . He sounds wonderful . Yeah , he was . I see what you mean by a survivor . This summer went by too fast . I had such high hopes for this book . To tell you the truth , I'm floundering . Is this the first time you've tried to write a book ? Oh , I've published a couple of short stories . Nothing ... Nothing any good . I've never been able to do it full time . I've always been busy with other obligations . You don't want to hear about all this . You know , Lane showed me some of your short stories and ... .. I thought they were wonderful . It's funny . I've wanted to talk to you so often , ... .. but we never seem to be alone . We were alone . We were alone for a whole afternoon . Running into you at the local flea market is not exactly private . Well , we walked around together . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? Well , I felt awkward . At least you liked the record I found you so it wasn't a complete waste of time . It's so funny because I used to be in love with a boy who just idolised Art Tatum . Well , this was years ago on my first visit to Paris . He was a student and he played piano in a jazz club in the student quarter . He didn't speak any English . And we spent a summer trying to make each other understand our feelings . The funny thing was it didn't matter that we only knew a few words . Oh , anyway , that was years ago . I hate thunder . I don't care how harmless it is , I wan na get under the bed ! - The air is full of electricity . - I'm serious ! - Where is everyone ? I heard voices . - Hi . - How do I look ? Don't say "" old and fat "" . - Great . Great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let's get some more lights on . Did Lane make any hors d'oeuvres ? What were you two doing before we came down ? Excuse me ? What ? I hope you weren't out on the porch . That lightning's getting close . - Oh , no . - No . - Let's have some music . - All right . Who wants what ? - Well , you know about me . Peter ? - Vodka . - Stephanie , what do you want ? - Vodka , please . Have you given any more thought about my memoirs ? They deserve better than me . They're too good to waste on a fledgling writer . You're patronising me . - Lane says you think my life is trivial . - I never said that . - Lloyd , come on , dance with me . - Oh , honey , I'm such a stiff . If you can figure out the universe , you can figure out the box step . All right . See , there ? You're terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to say to you . Oh , well , it's , you know ... There are people coming over and people here , so ... - I don't wan na be pushy . - No , you're not pushy . I wish you 'd been here for the whole summer . Yeah , well , I couldn't . I have obligations , too , so ... What is that record ? It's terrific ! It's Art Tatum and Ben Webster . - It's funny . - What ? I made a complete fool out of myself when I met you . - No ! You didn't . - I remember carrying on at great length ... .. about writing and metaphor and choice . - I left no clich� ? unturned . - No . Actually I just ... No , I ... I just thought you were so sweet . You reminded me of Paul , the boy that I knew in Paris . - Really ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - Well , I'm very flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster ? Art Tatum's the piano . See , and I always felt foolish all the time because ... - Why ? - .. I was very taken with you right off . I love all the music from that era . You don't have any Benny Goodman , do you ? Uh , not here . Or Coon-Sanders Nighthawks ? - Now , please don't panic when I say this . - No . I just think that you're incredibly lovely . Peter , don't . Don't , please . Let's just stop this before it's too late . You know , I can't . I just ... I just feel flushed and ... and my heart is pounding . - - Oh , there are the Richmonds . Get it , will you , Lloyd ? - Oh , Howard ! - Oh , it's pouring out there . We were expecting the Richmonds . Let me get you a drink . Hi , Howard . Hi . Oh , the Richmonds must be stuck . You're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Ouija board ! Look ! They take too long . What you want is a computerised Ouija board . That way you can punch up any dead person you wan na talk to . - Howard , you did say Scotch ? - Ask Lane to dance with you . - Me ? - Mm-hm . She'll be thrilled . - She's got a big crush on you . - I don't dance . That's what everybody says . Come on . She's been so blue . - Lane ? - Yes ? Go ahead . Go ahead ! Uh , Lane , uh , Peter was just asking me ... .. if I 'd ask you to dance with him . Oh ! No , thank you . Oh , yes , thank you . That music is fabulous ! I used to go to Harlem to hear music like that . I was dating a disc jockey . He used to call records "" sides "" . - - I have two left feet . I'll get that . I'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bothering you ? - No , not at all . - I like her energy . - It's the record you got at the flea market . - I didn't know you liked jazz . - You like Prokofiev . Yeah , but not to dance to . The Richmonds aren't coming . Their house is flooded . Really ? Then maybe we can go to the Kurosawa film . - In this storm ? - Well , you know , maybe . Let's not let it kill our evening . The Richmonds aren't coming . We're lucky . They're so boring ! - Then why did you invite them ? - Uh-oh . Oh , God ! - This could last for hours . - Lloyd . - Just light some candles . - OK . I'll get some matches . I love walking around in the pitch-black . I think I put my hand in the guacamole . Lloyd ! The Richmonds are flooded , the electricity's gone off . God is testing us and I , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vodka ? O . M . I don't know any Toms . Oh , wait a minute . Are you that dentist in Hackensack that tried to rape me when I was 15 ? No ? OK . OK . One more try . Ooh , I . C . Oh , God . Nick . Wait a minute . Are you in this room ? Is your ghost in this room , bullet hole an ' all ? You were so bad . But so gorgeous . Do you still comb your hair like you were in Sicily ? Well , we had some good times . It was hectic . It was dangerous . And then it ended . I think it's clearing up . Yeah ? Please don't move away from here . I have to . You know , I should never drink . My head really spins . How are you gon na drive home ? Same way I always do : .. thinking about you . You know , in all the time I've known you I don't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the year after my wife died I was never sober . Of course , on the faculty of the school where I work , it's ... hard to tell . I'm gon na miss you so much . I'm gon na miss you , too , ... .. but we'll always stay in touch . You know what I'm saying . Howard , please . I have to ... When you got that offer today to sell the house , I ... .. I realised suddenly ... .. we wouldn't be sharing those winter evenings again . Yeah , but you knew I was only up here to get well , and not permanently . Is the difference in our ages awkward for you ? I'm in love with Peter . Isn't that the most ridiculous thing ? Considering I don't think I even have a chance with him . I did for a while . I keep telling myself that maybe it'll still work out all right somehow . And why Peter and not you ? No reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch you . Please . Please , don't . Now that I've embarrassed us both ... Let me make you some coffee . You're gon na have a terrible hangover tomorrow . I don't play this game that well in the light , let alone the dark . Look how much it's cleared up . You can see a billion stars . It should be nice tomorrow . So tell me , ... .. is it true you worked on the atomic bomb ? No . Did Diane tell you that ? Yes . Not at all . I did one small , unrelated project at Los Alamos many years ago . But when she's describing me to people I'm the father of the A-bomb . What branch of physics are you involved with ? Something much more terrifying than blowing up the planet . Really ? Is there anything more terrifying than the destruction of the world ? Yeah . The knowledge that it doesn't matter one way or the other . That it's all random . Originating aimlessly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm not talking about the world . I'm talking about the universe . All space , all time , just ... .. a temporary convulsion . And I get paid to prove it . You feel sure of that , when you look out on a night like tonight ... .. and see all those millions of stars ? That none of it matters ? I think it's just as beautiful as you do . And vaguely evocative of some deep truth that always just keeps slipping away . But then my professional perspective overcomes me , ... .. a less wishful , more penetrating view of it , ... .. and I understand it for what it truly is . Haphazard , ... .. morally neutral ... .. and unimaginably violent . Look , we shouldn't have this conversation . I have to sleep alone tonight . That's why I cling to Diane ... .. and consider myself very lucky . She's warm and vital and holds me while I sleep . That way I don't have to dream of photons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your daughter hates me . Our daughter ... .. hates me , and I love her . She's my one child , ... .. and I want her to be happy . She never got over the shooting , you know . See , now , I'm a tough cookie . I can file and forget . Rap once if you hear me , Richard . I want her to forgive me . So you speak to her . OK , Richard ? You two were so close . She loved you so much . You rap if you hear me , Richard . Rap , Richard . Rap once . Rap . I love those old songs . Between the music , the candlelight and the drinks , ... .. it feels like we're in some exotic place . Mm . I should never drink . My head swims . What are you doing ? I've wanted to touch your face since the first time we met . What do you want me to say to you ? Soon we'll be going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible . Lane is my best friend . She's crazy about you . I don't think I could ever do that . - And she's become so attached to you . - Please . I already feel guilty enough because I led her on . Not on purpose . I just wasn't thinking about anyone but myself . She's told me about all the time you spent together . I know about all your walks and talks by the lake , under the stars . She's told me all that . I felt very lonely . I needed some company , and my marriage broke up . I was losing confidence that I could write this book . I needed a voice to keep me from panicking . But you made love together . I didn't understand how vulnerable she was until it was too late . I know it's my fault . Would you ... Would you have become serious about her if I hadn't come along ? I don't know . Maybe . You do funny things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm married . You know , my kids come home from camp in a week . I have a life . I know . But is it the life you want ? Is it ? - You've been flirting with me for weeks . - Please , just go away . My husband's a wonderful man . Oh , he's bewildered because I wanted this summer apart . He's a radiologist . He takes X-rays , but ... .. I never let him take them of me because , if he looked inside , he 'd ... .. he 'd see things that he wouldn't understand and he 'd be terribly hurt . Somewhere along the line I just ... .. I just started going through the motions of my life . Steffie ... I've just ... I've just longed so to hear certain things said to me again . I want so much to respond , but I can only run . - Don't run . - I can only run . That's all I can do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn't look at you when you were around because I felt so guilty . I wan na kiss you right now . You can't . You can't because there's too many problems . This is just out of the question . Out of the question . We're gon na be discovered . Just please go away . It's out of the question . Time for me to go home . Sorry about the Kurosawa film . I made some coffee before . D' you want me to heat it up for you ? No , thanks . I 'd rather stay drunk . Maybe you 'd better . I'm supposed to work tomorrow . You've been in such a strange mood all night . Did you know that the universe was haphazard , morally neutral ... .. and unimaginably violent ? Peter ... What happened to us ? What do you mean ? You know , we were getting so close ... .. and we ... we shared all that time ... .. and , um ... .. and that night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I misreading the signs ? Maybe you did . I can't let myself get involved right now . I'm gun-shy from my marriage and ... .. I'm unsettled about my life , my work . Can I help ? They're my problems . I don't wan na cause you any suffering . You're doing so well . You need to think about yourfuture . Yeah , I know . I know you're right . I ... It's silly , but I just ... You know , I have these dreams that , when we're both in New York , ... .. you know , we 'd ... I don't know . You know , we just ... We feel things so similarly so much of the time , ... .. and that's so rare . I don't ... I'm sorry , I'm really tired . I don't know what I'm saying . The funny thing is that I'll probably wind up calling you at 3am in New York ... .. to keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I give you a hand there ? - No , that's OK . Listen , I had a talk with Peter . And he doesn't wan na get involved right now . And that's OK . I understand that . He's ... You know , he's got a lot of problems . But I ... But maybe things will be different later on . You know ? I'm glad that things are out in the open anyway . You know , I do feel better . We'll both be living in New York . Who knows ? You know , anything could happen . Who could that be ? Hello ? Oh , Ken . No , she's right here . One second . Ken , listen . I told you the lights were out and the phone was out . I couldn't call you ! Right . Yes . I still don't know . I'm thinking about spending some time in New York . Please don't bring that up now . It's late and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Oh , God . I didn't know you were still here . I heard your voice . Peter , we're not alone . Steffie , I love you . From the first day . We could be alone . I can't spend the night in the guesthouse . Maybe not the whole night , ... .. but we could have some of it alone together . Oh , God . Would you ? Look , if ... If this means anything to you , ... .. I really want to , but I ... I just love this room . It's just perfect . We could knock this wall out and make one big room . - That's a thought . - It's big enough as it is . I love the size . OK , whatever . - What about fishing ? - The lake has bass , Lane told me . Of course , you can always stock the lake . It seems so inane to dump fish into a lake just to pull ' em back out again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a golfer ! Gim me a break . That's Diane Frazier . I used to have such a crush on her when I 'd see her picture . - Diane Frazier ? Wasn't she ... - She was a model , playgirl . She was always at the Stork Club or El Morocco with some tennis player . - Those people lead such exciting lives . - Yes , don't they ? - It's gon na be great to get out of the city . - I'm so excited about buying a dog . Our co-op doesn't permit dogs and I've always wanted a pit bull . I 'd love to go upstairs and take some measurements . Lane , is it OK to go upstairs ? Oh , well , my mother's still sleeping up there . - Really ? - Yeah . She's a late sleeper . I don't think I ever slept past noon . - She'll be up soon . - Maybe we could see the barn ? Could you show us the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know where it is , don't you ? Just follow that path out of the house . I'll join you in one second . I just wan na finish up . - They gon na buy ? - Looks like it . That's great . Lane , Howard called , and the stand that sells the corn you like is open again . - He's gon na bring some over . - Uh-huh . What's the matter ? Why are you so depressed ? I just think about Peter all the time . Lane , just don't . Don't . I think he's gon na write that book on my mother . God . They're all supposed to go out today together . If she ever gets up . Oh , she's up . She said she 'd be a little late . - Lane , could I speak to you ? - Yes . - We need you to answer some questions . - OK . Their final offer is 175 . 175 ? You said two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This area isn't what it was . But I've really been counting on that money . - Are you sure ? - I'm sorry . - - Yeah ? - Hi . - Hi . Um , Diane said they 'd be a little late . I'll let them know that you're here . You've really been avoiding me . I think you should leave and go back to New York . I 'd like to know what's going on . I'm having a hard time and , even though she tries to hide it , Lane is , too . - Don't say that . - She thinks about you all the time . - And you ? - Naturally , I think about you . And yet you avoid me . - Will you write Diane's biography ? - Believe it or not , I'm thinking about it . Why ? What happened to the book about your father ? I know . I ... It just isn't coming . I told you that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and I ... I don't know . It's lifeless . And then I hear all these sensational anecdotes and stories . You know ? This woman's had an incredible life . I mean , the shooting alone is a book . - Lane doesn't want it written . - I'm not so sure . If I do it , I can protect her . Somebody's gon na write it . Look , Peter , just put yourself in her place for one minute . Here's this 14-year-old girl . Her mother leaves her father , who Lane adored , ... .. and moves in with this thug , who beats up Diane , and Lane ends up shooting him . It's completely wrecked her life . You don't wan na put her through it again . You know , people staring at her as she walks down the street . I don't know . I'm sorry . I'm really sorry . I don't ... I just feel so ... guilt-ridden . I'm just very tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ... Steffie . Let's ... Let's go to Paris together . "" Let's go to Paris together . "" My God . You really are a writer , aren't you ? This is why I have to stay away from you . Because you just make my head ... spin . I just can't ... I can't do this . I can't ... Oh , my God . - I guess we should have knocked . - I always worry about rabies . I read about a woman bitten by a squirrel in Central Park and she got rabies . Nothing like that ever happens up here . What bothers me are not the raccoons but gnats . They drive you crazy . You don't have a big insect problem here , do you , Lane ? Lane ? - But you do have mosquitoes ? - Naturally , with the pond . Well , mosquitoes are rare . Aren't they , Lane ? - Lane ? - It's ... It's usually very pleasant . - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snakes don't eat the frogs ! Is it OK if we go upstairs ? Yes , um ... Sorry . I'm getting a headache . I'll rejoin you in a few minutes . OK , but hurry . There are many questions Mr and Mrs Raines have . Yes . Now , what about hornets and bees ? This is the country , Mrs Raines , not midtown Manhattan . Oh , my God . I just can't believe that happened ! - It was my fault . - Oh , Peter , please ! I just can't handle this ! Lane . Lane , I'm sorry . Lane . Lane , I'm sorry . Please forgive me . - Lane ! - Has this been going on long ? No . No ! Please . Jesus . - Are you in love with him ? - It's not what you think . - What do you mean ? - Lane , I just don't know what I've done . - I just don't know what I've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There's nothing to make sense . Absolutely nothing to make sense . So many times I saw you and Peter looking at each other . No , don't do that . Just don't do that . This is my fault . Stephanie's not to blame . - Leave us alone . - I'm sorry you found out like this . There's nothing to find out . You're making it worse . There's not nothing . Let's get this out on the table . I want Steffie to go with me to New York or Paris . Peter , the summer's over . I'm going back to Philadelphia . I miss my children . I can't play these games . I've been married too long . I just ... I don't know what I am . I don't know what I've done . I just ... I'm not who I thought I was . I'm beginning to think that antique fair will be too crowded . You're getting cold feet about driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought today's the wrong day . We could postpone it . You and Peter could work on the book around here . You know , Peter , I think we could do a whole section on Las Vegas . I know so many great Sammy Davis stories . He's the best . - Did ya tell Lane about our conversation ? - Oh , yeah . Listen , darling . Lloyd and I have decided that we wan na live here . This house is our idea of heaven . I fell in love with it the moment I stepped inside . It was like coming home . I know you're off back to the city , but whenever you wan na use it , it's yours . You know , weekends or the summertime . Whenever . You're gon na need a sweater . I better go up and get one . I don't understand . You know one of my first projects ? I'm gon na put in a pool . I never , ever liked the pond because there's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer . I took her swimming in Santa Fe . She outdid everybody . - She's got perfect legs for a bathing suit . - What are you talking about ? We're gon na move back here . We've discussed it and decided to move back here . Lloyd loves Vermont and I have always loved this house . - And if ... - You can't move back here . - Why not ? - Because I'm about to sell this place . - You're selling it ? - I told you ... - Wait a minute . Since when ? - I've mentioned this three times at least . - You have ? - Don't you ever listen to me when I talk ? Do you only care about what you have to say ? Why are you getting so nasty ? I got people here right now - buyers . They're looking at it . Well , Jesus , wherever they are , just go and find them and tell them the sale is off . - What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be our home . You can't tell me that now . What are you talking about ? This is the family house . How can you sell this place ? You don't own it . - Well , who owns it ? - Uh ... . I do . Well , I mean , we do . You and me . Your father and I bought it . But you gave it to me years ago . I told you then I might sell it and divide the money . - You said great , you could use the cash . - Was I sober when I gave it to you ? - You said it was mine . - To live in , darling , but not to sell . To live in ? What does that mean ? To maintain ? To repair ? To keep up ? Am I the caretaker ? I've said a lot of things in haste . When it comes to practical matters , I'm a dodo . I can't afford to move without selling this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s expensive being sick . - Nobody's throwing you out in the cold . - I've been counting on this money . I haven't been working in two years . I've used up everything . I've borrowed . Darling , it's as simple as this : my plans have changed . - What ? ! - We want to settle here . Your father and I bought this house . He 'd have wanted it to stay in the family . - Can't we discuss this later ? - You're such a phoney ! He bought the house , not you , and I've kept it going ! - Lane ! - Couldn't you have just stayed away ? Lloyd and I are not young . We wan na settle . Who knows ? Maybe we'll hate it and in a year we'll move . My life is just not worth all the trouble ! Everyone , just stop it ! Diane , Lane has been through so much . - Don't get angry , sweetheart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Like I'm to blame for everything . - You are ! - OK , calm down . - I'm calm , Lloyd . I am calm . We all make mistakes , but what's done is done . And if your life didn't turn out , don't keep accusing me ! You're the one who pulled the trigger ! I only said what the lawyers told me to . - What an absurd thing to say . - It's not absurd . It's the truth ! I don't think this is the place to have that discussion . I'm just wrecked ! And you come and go with no guilt ! I don't wan na hear any more of this . Stop it right now . It's her excuse for a life wasted , thrown away to spite me . - That's not true ! - Yes ! Out of spite ! Pure spite ! Maybe things could have been different for me if I didn't have to go through that ! - Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ! - Pardon me ? - Get out of here ! Please , just leave ! - Diane ! Relax ! - Get out of here now ! - Diane , just relax . - OK , take the house . - I didn't realise it meant that much to you . - That's enough . I said she could have the house ! Now can we go ? That's enough ! There are things I might do differently if I had them to do over , but I don't . My head is splitting open ! OK , I'm sorry for all the fuss . We all make mistakes . Lane , can I have the sleeping pills back ? - I don't know where they are . - They're not in the medicine cabinet . - What's the difference ? - That's the stupidest thing I ever heard . What are you talking about , "" what's the difference "" ? Where are they ? I have no reason to get up tomorrow . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . What about your plans to move to New York and set up a photography studio ? You're so damn angry . If I haven't made it as a photographer by now , why would I ? I don't know . You'll just have to try harder , won't you ? So ... .. you and Peter are in love with each other ? We just became very attracted to each other . These things happen . - You knew how much I cared about him . - It happened by itself . I didn't instigate it . You know , we're all up here isolated from the world . Unpredictable things happen . The truth is ... .. I flirted with Peter , ... .. I wanted him to want me , ... .. but I didn't think it would go very far . I just wanted to know that I could be wanted . And he seemed very challenging . You know , he's very clever and busy with his novel . And he's charming and smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. very vulnerable he is and ... .. he's so uncertain . And my heart went out to him . And I began dreaming about him . What's gon na happen ? Are you gon na go away with him ? I can't . No , I can't do that . It's ... It's not so easy when you're married with ... kids . That's something I wouldn't know . Now give me those pills . Tomorrow will come and you'll find some distractions . You'll get rid of this place . You'll move back to the city . You'll work . You'll fall in love . And maybe it'll work out and maybe it won't . But you'll find a million petty things to keep you going , ... .. and distractions to keep you from focusing on the ... On the truth . I don't know what the truth is and you don't either . I just wan na swallow all of this Valium . Well , it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . - I'll take ' em all . - Stop it . Stop it . You're behaving like a petulant child . If you really wanted to die , you would have done that the last time . I'm so lonely . OK , stop it , and just give me the pills . You really wan na die ? No . No . That's my problem . I ... I always wanted to live . Where the hell is everybody ? Where is everybody ? Boy , the going gets rough and everybody vanishes . Lane , we're leaving ! Lane ! God , I hate this outfit . I look like one of the Hundred Neediest Cases . You look beautiful . You know , I'm gon na miss this place . Hadn't realised how pretty it was up here . It's so tranquil . And it's been in the family for so long . It's the closest thing I can think of to roots . It might have been nice . Dear , it's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not in the cards . Palm Beach will be fine . The place is unimportant as long as we're together . Oh , Lloyd . Lane , we're leaving for Palm Beach . If you need me , we're staying with the Chasens . And let's not have a wake over what happened before . It's over and done with . Life's too short to dwell on our tragedies . Right ? Besides , I'm sure we all said things we're sorry for . We're all temperamental . Otherwise , we wouldn't all be so fascinating . I'm sorry if I caused you any grief . OK ? I wasn't thinking . Oh , well . It's over now . Lane , ... .. you always liked this , ... .. and I want you to keep it . Stephanie , ... .. this is for you . I saw you admiring it and I 'd love you to have it . Thank you . Jesus ! Look at my hands . Now , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could merge them into a tan . What do you think ? - Can I help with the bags ? - Oh , my God ! I forgot . Howard , just in time to say goodbye and help with the luggage . I'll get the door . Lloyd , put that hanging piece on top , I beg you . Everything'll be mussed . Thanks , Howard . Terrific . The door's open . Lane , let them get it , honey . Come here . Come here . Now ... No , never mind . You know where we're gon na be , with the Chasens , ... .. so if you need me for anything - your hair looks just darling down like that - .. you call me . D' you hear me ? OK . And tell Peter that I've got to rethink my memoirs . If I come up with a fresh approach , then I'll call him . Goodbye . Be a good girl . Oh , God . Have you got my make-up kit ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly ? I still travel with it . It's like a lucky charm . Maybe I should donate it to the antique fair ! Will I see you again ? I think you should leave . I'm going to stay with Lane and then go back home . It's funny . You meet somebody under strange circumstances . You fall in love and then you go off in separate directions . Peter , please don't make this hard for me . - Please . - I feel so empty . You haven't even gone yet and I feel like I've lost something I'll never find again . I'm so disappointed in myself . Steffie . Time will pass and you'll forget this summer . And you ? Will you forget it ? I'll try . It won't be easy , but I'll try . Now she's off to Palm Beach as though nothing had happened . Well , I really should be going , too . My debts . I have to manage the final sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you not to worry . Howard . And that I'll take care of you , that nothing would make me happier . I've gotten so used to having you in my life . - You're all that gives it meaning now . - Howard , don't . Don't . - I'm sure that ... - I can't . .. when you leave here ... .. I'll never see you again . But I really did grow to love you . Lane . I came to say goodbye . I think it's better if I head back to the city tonight . You haven't finished your book . It's finished . What a sad tone in your voice . I loved all the time we spent together . And I appreciate your faith in me and ... .. the encouragement . I'm sorry I couldn't live up to it . Well ... Take care of her , Howard . - Hi . - Hi . Would you like some tea ? No . - It's chilly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . In a few days it'll be September . I know . There are so many things to do , selling a house . It'll keep you busy . That's good . When do you have to go home ? In a couple of days I'll go back . The kids need school supplies and new shoes . - Sweet kids . - Yeah . Oh , Steffie . Soon you'll leave here and you'll start all over again in

A Class C felony . Second degree manslaughter . I don't make the law , but it's the law . there is no law when it comes to dieing that way . That's where you're wrong . There are a lot of laws when it comes to dieing . Others knew that he was going to kill himself , and they did nothing . Hey man , this is Rory's psychic hotline I see your future ...

You lied to me . Never misuse a woman . - I'm warning you . I'm a cop . Yes , you're right and I'm warning you , never fuck with a drag queen . Oh , oh ! Easy , easy ! . I could charge them , you know . I could put their asses in jail if I wanted to . That's a great idea . You think sarge would give my stripes for getting my ass kicked by a drag queen ? A cold beer would help . Thank you . Smells good , mom . Tell me again about you let my baby get beat up in a gay bar . I got carried away . - Oh ... You never give up . You're so stubborn , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to you about something . Did Dad ever er ... Consider suicide ? - Who doesn't ?

Isn't that cute ? Brownie Mary . They're not bad . My brownies always turn out so dreadful . Where did you get pot ? - Cousin Stevie . I think he sells it . I bought a pound . Very cheap . I'm so thirsty . I'm dieing , mom . I know . I don't want to wait . I want to do it now . What are you saying ? I can feel it getting closer , Mamma . Everyday is harder and harder . What if I wake up one morning and I can't recognize you , you know ... You remember the way it was with grandpa , he didn't know who we were . I don't want to end like that . I don't want to ... I want to do it my own way . No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... You don't want ... You don't want ... Suicide , mom . These chocolates of Gordon's are outrageous . This is a friend of Matt . Your name ? No comment . You don't have to show my face ... Punk ! To be honest with you Mr Campbell . Given the circumstances , a jury would question that kind of behavior , don't you think ? I didn't even want to be there . She made me do it . All that we're trying to do here is establish exactly what happened that night . I want you to tell me what part you played . Mr Matlin , Matt said he wanted this to be special . Immediately I thought of a buffet . - A buffet ? You made a buffet ? You catered a suicide . - Shut up , Judy . Who do you think had the most to gain from Matt's death ? I 'd say Matt . I'm talking about his estate . He left some life insurance to his nieces ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Greedy sons of bitches , Welcome to my will signing . Come on , people we got a lot of work here to do today . My relatives are coming over at 2-00 PM . And my Uncle Leo does not need to know that I have a big , purple bong ... . Dana . Which will be the first item up for grabs ... - The Master Blaster . What's it gon na do ? Kill me ? Actually , I've been feeling a lot better lately . Possibly the anticipation . - Why are you doing that ? Because I want to die while I can still wipe my own ass . And always leave the party while you're still having a good time . Yeah ... Hello . I got the TV , so don't even think about it . - I get the VCR . Anyone ? I got two Stevie Nicks albums and a microwave . Mona got some ice tongs and a feather boa . We were not into Mattie for his inheritance . - Miss Eisner ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious matter . A lot of Matt's friends were at that party . He didn't act alone . I helped Matt . November 2001 Aids Treatment . Can I help you ? Oh , Hi , Jackie . A dentist ? Great . Dr Faluti . ... 878 Great . Thanks . Oh , and call me when you get the Tuinal from your your mom's Doctor . Great , ' bye . Hi . This is Amy Eisner . I'm a friend of Jackie Dowling's . I have this impacted tooth and my dentist is out of town . How's it looking for prescription drugs ? Oh , Mona has a junkie friend who might be able to get us morphine . A junkie friend ... Oh , that's good . Take the refills from my doctor ... and make sure you use different pharmacies . Good . Do you think I need a disguise ? No . So tell me , do you have a departure date planned ? I didn't know that undertakers made house calls . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? - I fell off a friend's trampoline . This prescription is for Par ? gorique . It's an opium based anti-diarrhoeal . All that jumping gave her diarrhoea . You are big boy ... I 'd go extra large . Thank you . I could lose my license over this , you know . Look , you can have the rest of them . But keep me out of this . You are part of this , Mrs Snell , whether you like it or not . Look , I wasn't even at the stupid party . I wasn't invited . Thanksgiving Evening , 2001 Have you lost your mind ? - Why ? Have you found one ? Who's that ? You ? You know it is ? - No . Me neither . This is big one in any case . What you are planning to do , man ... It doesn't make sense to me . How do you not know ... It doesn't make sense to me either . Well , why don't you stop moping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another doctor . What do you think I've been doing the last 7 years ? Nothing works anymore . Have you thought about these girls ? They love you . Their first date , their weddings ? I love the girls , you know that . They told me the last 6 weeks that I was gon na die . And what I've gone through since then , I can't do again . Well , I don't know what you are planning to do , Mattie . But you do not include me or mom . Do you hear me ? . Mommie is talking to Uncle Matt right now , sweetheart . You keep mom out of this . For once , think of her . I only hope that my daughters will be that kind for me . You don't have to go , mom . You don't . I keep imagining his face ... What he'll look like when it's over . When he's dead . - Okay , Mom . Stop it . That's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done this a long time ago . Gaby , it's what he wants , okay ? Just sit down somewhere . I think he'll look peaceful ... like he's sleeping . What is wrong with you ? Act like a mother . You lay off of her ! Sometimes the only way to protect a defenseless child is to ... Let him go back to God . I'm nott promising anything . That I'll be like Shirley MacLaine at his death bed . Remember Terms of Endearment ? Uh-huh .. She the Academy Award for that . What a perfect outfit . This sort of brings out the Sean Connery in you . You get out much ? - What happened the night Matthew Schapiro died ? He had a fucking blast ! Welcome viewers to a very special show . We are at Matt Shapiro's "" Event "" . The first time anyone's been inside one of these gatherings with a camera . Tell me who you are . - I'm Jodi , this is Alex , my boyfriend . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What's the celebration ? You don't know ? - No , I don't know . Oops ! Be selective . Be pleasant . Be firm . Ther's no reason for things to get physical . Okay ? Michael Musto is definitely an A . As for the rest , decide for yourself . Is Ru Paul on the A list or B list ? - If she's in drag then , A . If not , then , B . I'm trusting in you . Listen , later on I might not get the chance to say goodbye , so ... Laurie Anderson is definitely a B now . It's so much more ... ... . .. I'm gon na be all rigt ... . - Promise me you'll get some therapy . Oh , Fuck Off ! Why I have'nt I got one ? - Why , of course , you can have a VIP pass . Good . I was always at my best with you . But get a vocal coach before you screw up . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurting people . Count age by friends , and not in years . Count your days smiles and not your tears . That's the last thing you're gon na say to me ? That , and that I'm in love with you . Ever since I've known you . Marry me ... HELLO ... EXCUSE ME ... Could I have your attention for a moment please ? Could we have a moment of silence ... For Matt . Ten minutes and then , to bed . And then The Simpsons ended . See ya . there was so much ... love in that room . Sometimes people die alone .. But ... this , this ... This was beautiful . That was it .. I hooked up the IV and watched the liquid flow down the tube and into his veins . You know ... That second , when I realized he was dead ... You feel so bad ... ' Cos then I was dead . Is there anything else you want to add to your confession ? They all killed themselves . Eddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wasn't there , but I know it ... See , all my clients die , but half of them won't wait . And sometimes ... they have parties ... to say goodbye . And , whether you like it or not , unless you can cure them they're just gon na keep on doing it . Stand up and put your hands on the table . I 'd like to add something to my statement . All right . Go ahead . It took a few tries to get a vein . I don't know why Matt asked me to do it . I hate needles . But how could I say no ? After I got it in , it was easy to connect the IV line . You're telling me that you assisted a man's suicide . - Yeah , that's right . I hooked up the bag of Dilotit . - Dilaudid . The drip was so slow that I had to squeeze the bag to empty it . It got all over his shirt . He breathing became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he opened his eyes wide and he was gone . You're really good . Really thorough Your mother must be proud of him . - She is ... Thank you . And your father ? - He passed away . Oh , I'm sorry . How did he die ? - He didn't die , he was a police officer . He died in the line of duty . Your father was a hero . To me , my son was a hero . He had tumors growing on his brain . Terrible seizures , and there was no way to help him . Mrs Schapiro , it is unfair to lose someone you love , but there has to be laws . When your father was laying there , suffering ... Did any lawyer's opinion matter more than the his ? What are you going to do to me ? My son is gone ... In my world , love .. is above the law . How many of them confessed ? Six . That would be sick if all of them did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them ? God damn it .. There was one night , when the pain was unbearable ... The morphine wasn't doing enough . So he asked me if I would give him a bunch of sleeping pills so he could end it . He said that nobody would have to know . Oh God , Nick . I told him I wouldn't do it . He was begging me , mom . I just don't know if I did the right thing . So , I followed your trail . Did it lead you to the killers ? It scattered in the wind around Union Square . I'm sorry about arresting you . Now you have a record . I went a little too far . And I'm sorry ... about your loss . You think you know how you're gon na react , but you ... we fool ourselves . Want to know what happened ? I love you . I can stop this , lila . He'll wake up tomorrow and be pissed off but er ... He'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please , don't let all this be in vain . Please ... That's all I ask . Oh My God Oh God , we're gon na do this one does it . We're actually doing this . Mattie , wake up you son of a bitch . Wake up you son of a bitch . Oh Fuck ! Fuck , Fuck , Fuck ! He's thrown up all the pills . - What does that mean ? Maybe you should leave . - No . I can't . I can't . Hi , Bri . If you're playing this , then that means it's over ... I wanted to thank you ... and tell you not to feel bad or carry what I did around , like it's some big secret . You can tell whoever you need to ' cos that's your job . It's the survivor's jog to tell the story . Anyway , I wrote a little piece for you . I hope you like it . Take care of mom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I give you this ? The Aids crisis is not over . - Thank you very much . Can I give you some information on Aids ? Okay , that's good . May I give you this ? May I give you this ? Hi this is Matt , I'm in heaven now . Leave your message and someone else will get back to you . Hi , Mattie . It's your mother . I know it's silly but silly , but this is the only way I can still hear your voice . I love you .

Besides , we need to take the "" in "" good times and bad "" vow , right ? This is gon na be great practice for the bad . My name is father heery , and welcome to your engagement encounter . I know that some of you are here only because this program is a prerequisite for being married in the catholic church . The church , who I represent , has gotten many things wrong in its past . This , I think , is one of the things that we've gotten right . [Laughing] Oh , wow . Wow , she set everything up without me . Huh . [Laughs] Cool . Hello , you two . [Laughs] Come inside . I have champagne . [Laughs] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe . [Laughs] [Indistinct_conversation] Yes ? Yeah . Great . [Laughs] More ? Yeah . Okay , that's good . All right . Thank you . [Laughter] Let me see that . Oh . Oh . I know . It was burning hole in my pocket . Could not wait until Christmas Eve . And you never know if another guy was gon na swoop in and ask her first . [Laughs] I 'd have to start throwing punches , just like you taught me . Oh , yeah ... stomach , chin , nose . [Both_laugh] Oh , Deb , I'm so glad that you're with us for the holidays . Now , if there are any special traditions or foods that remind you of Christmas at your folks's house , please tell me . Everything pastry . Deb doesn't even need a reminder of Christmas . Yeah , just put it out . I will inhale . [Laughter] I'm gon na balloon this weekend . Oh , please . There's plenty of time before you have to slip into that wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rehearsal dinner . Just find a church with a really long aisle . [Laughter] Good idea . So , you're getting married in the church ? We've been engaged for five hours , mom . Okay . Nice . Debbie , I don't know what your family traditions are for Christmas Eve , but Melissa and roddy and I go to midnight mass . Maybe you can get this guy to join us ? For old time's sake ? I'm gon na go get the luggage . Especially since it's being offered in his father's honor . You know , it's 15 years this year ? I don't need a mass to remind me . I was saying that to Debbie . Why don't you think of it as a celebration ? It's not an occasion I feel like celebrating . How much did they charge you to say the mass in dad's memory , by the way ? It's a suggested donation , and I gave more than they suggested , ' cause I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me lobby for your salvation . Oh , how the song remains the same . Okay , time for bed . We have a party tomorrow . Mwah ! [Laughs] Honey , I understand how someone can lose their faith in this day and age , but you get older , and it can ... mom . Oh , honey , I'm sorry . Yes . Too much champagne . Uh , I'm sorry for bringing all this up on your big night . I-I was just trying to ... you were just talking about the weekend . [Laughs] Yeah . The weekend . [Laughs] Oh , I'm so glad you're here , both of you . And I am overtired , so I'm gon na go up , say my prayers , and thank God that you two found one another and that you decided to do something about it . [Laughs] We were the same age you are now ... now . Too many people your age wait too long . But I always thought that if you find the right person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life gets in the way and messes things up . Mom , I love you . Oh . I know . I love you , honey . He would have been so happy for you . [Laughs] I know . Really , good night . Let me assure you that this weekend is not for the church . It's for you ... the couple as a couple . If you immerse yourself in the work of this weekend , it can be the greatest experience of your relationship so far . Who here can say that their fianc ? is the first person to whom they've said "" I love you "" in an adult , romantic way ? Thank you . By most of you not raising your hand , you've admitted that your fianc ? is not the first person you've loved . And that's not surprising . People get married later nowadays , but what it does suggest is that this thing that we call love is not the only thing that makes a marriage last . I mean , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feeling would be enough . Ladies and gentlemen , the road to marriage is littered with the broken plans of many wonderful couples who , with full-throated conviction , stepped to the altar and vowed the most serious of promises but then , for , oh , a variety of reasons , decided to separate . What's with father doomsday ? Shh . And yet , you are convinced your marriage will be different . Your workbooks are for a process called t.W.O.S ... Talking , writing , openness , and sharing . And you'll be led in some exercises by our married couple , Theresa and Mike . [Applause] All right . * let's get this party started [laughs] All right , we 'd like you each to write down your fianc ? ' s most endearing quality and then turn and tell them . Come on . You're an amazing friend . Your kindness . Oh , you're actually doing this ? Two seconds . You are the most unselfish person I know . I don't come close to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Both_laugh] You're a great lay . [Chuckles] What ? Your dedication to your work . You're good at organizing clutter . I don't think I heard the question right . Yeah ... No . Your sense of humor . I mean , cook . Good cook . Yummy stuff always . Okay . I'm changing mine . Everything . That can't be true . That can't be true . I knew you 'd say that , so I started a footnoted list underneath "" everything , "" like your smile , which conveys your deep reserves of kindness , your willingness to believe the best about people , uh , your generosity of spirit , of [laughter] , the way you focus your eyes when you're really listening , the sigh you make after we make love ... Okay , okay . Your total determination to achieve every position from that "" position of the day "" desk calendar you bought me . [Laughing] We're in a church . Look , God is all-knowing . I mean , your flexibility is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so try , while you're here , to get your mind off your wedding plans ... the bridesmaid who hates her dress , the groomsman who still hasn't given you his tuxedo sizes . [Laughs] Clear your head of all the expectations , all the worries , and relax . Close your eyes . Come on , come on . Close your eyes and think about the early moments right after you got engaged . Close my eyes with a priest in the room ? [Laughs] No , sir . Think about the early moments after you said "" yes , "" the moment after you've leaped from hope into faith and the journey toward matrimony began . I love that we live together in New York , and yet , my mother puts us in separate bedrooms . It's fun . You get to sneak in later . Mm-hmm . Honey , what is with the cowboy hat ? Kevin henges shaved half my head . I think I chose wisely . Are you gon na ask Kevin to be your best man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dawn . "" Junior class writing award "" ? How come I don't know about this ? Two guys entered the contest . I wrote about my dead dad . He wrote about the virtues of cuervo . It was your first award as a writer . And my last . Doesn't mean there won't be a next . No . No , no . We should wait until Christmas . You didn't . [Laughs] I saw you pick it up at the store that time , and you looked at it for a while . Thank you . I love it . [Both_laugh] No . Come on . The journal's enough . "" The artist's way . "" It says that if you write three pages every morning , just whatever's on your mind , it inspires stuff , and it lets your imagination run wild . I've become less intrigued with my imagination .

I've read your stories , and I love your stories . You moved to New York to become a writer . You know what my dream is ? You and me and our family-to-be .

[Indistinct_conversations] Mary ... [Laughs] Who do you think has played "" margaritaville "" more ? Me or Jimmy buffett ? [Both_laugh] I never really liked doing drugs till I met you . Mm-hmm . Aww . [Laughs] Wait till I introduce you to cannibalism . [Laughing] What ? [Laughs] Are you kidding ? [Both_laugh] I've never seen people eat so many cold cuts . Your platter design was irresistible . I found that meat like a caterer . Mm , mm . I'm thinking of moving out here and starting my own business . You only got laid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better situation . Look , I e-mailed Dave your r ? sum ? . He's gon na get it to people . I'm not asking you to fix it .

[Laughing] Yes . Mcguire . Oh ! Hey , hey ! [Laughs] Kevin , you stinker . Oh , has that nativity scene ever looked better ? Yes , in 1993 , just before you drop-kicked the bear . There were no bears in Bethlehem . Mrs . mcguire , time to face the facts , huh ? I like chipmunks . Well , where is your drunken son ? In the backyard , canoodling with his fianc ? e . His what ? ! [Laughs] So ... What the fuck ? ! Merry Christmas . What the fuck ? ! [Both_laugh] Hey , kids , Santa claus is here . Hey , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right now ? Am I that out of the loop ? No , man , no loop . Don't tell me that there is some New York imposter best friend that you conferred with instead of me . I didn't need to confer . I just needed to do it . Kev , where's your new girlfriend ? Uh , date . Oh , I'm sorry . Where's your date ? Inside bothering your mom . [Laughs] I'll go save her . All right . Uh ... Glassy eyes , tight jeans . Oh , just my type . Mm-hmm . [Both_laugh] I'll see you after church . Mwah ! You don't need to represent . [Laughs] No , it'll make your mom happy . Oh . All right . I think he'll be a good best man . Fun best man . Yeah . [Both_laugh] I got it . Shut up . [Laughs] Cheers , asshole . Cheers , you fuck-wad .

I'm never gon na find any better . That's no reason to stop exploring the nether regions of all the rest of womankind . You are 28 years old , sir . Old enough to start living my life with someone else . Oh , hey , Andy Rooney , drink a beer , huh ? [Laughs] [Groans] God , global warming , huh ? I love it . [Laughs] [Laughs] Hey , I got to ask you something . If I'm shocked ? Yes . What ? Spill it . I knew you dug her . She seems cool . But you've only brought her back home like twice , and , yeah , I was a little buzzed both times . Yes . And , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% fuckable ... whoa ! You were a well-traveled connoisseur of numerous vaginas before you met her . Oh , let's don't exaggerate . And as a fellow fan of vaginas ... can you quiet down , please ? I came out of one . I'm allowed to use the word . [Chuckles] I'm just saying ... to see an enthusiastic vaginal aficionado veer off course and , without warning , settle on just one , well , it is quite ... you might as admit ... portentous . Are you done ? Well ... It's as it should be . For some sorry bastards . So , how 'd you finally know ? You know , deep down , you know pretty quickly . You just don't admit you know because ... I don't know ... you wait until you feel like you're the type of man who's worthy to ask someone to say "" yes . "" Who are you ? The fucking riddler ? Tell me about a blinding white light . There's no lights . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the rest of your life with someone else , and it's picking that someone else .

I wanted to tell you in person . Oh ! Oh , Kevin , merry Christmas . And to you , man . It's roddy , for probably like the fifth time . [Laughs] Yeah , yeah . Sorry . I spaced my contact . Yeah , that's what you said last year , but whatever , man . I'll let it slip because right now , my brother-in-law's finally getting engaged ! Oh , fantastic ! Man , you are gon na love it . It's work , but it's ... but it's great . And you're great , dom , ' cause I got the bonus . Well done . You well done , you . [Laughs] You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have just lamed out and not gone in and got what I deserved . But I thought about what you said and I said , "" dom didn't "" give me this advice to make me crumble . He gave me this advice so I "" could soar .

He cut my bonus check right there . Oh , I'm sorry ... right here . Nicely done . Bank that . Well , most of it . Uh , when Melissa's "" acting "" "" class "" is over , we're gon na splurge and hit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole deal ... my treat . No , you and Melissa spend it on yourselves . No , no .

Please , let me just give something back . We'll get out the calendars . Yeah , we will . Oh , my God , I am so lucky I married into this family . Come here , man . I love you . Oh , I love you , too . [Laughs] I guess I'll have to console Deb when she finds out what you're really like . Shut up . [Laughs] How are you ? Oh , little brother , you did good . Oh , hey , Kevin . Melissa , sorry . Wow . I didn't even ... uh , holy shit , uh , you look incredible . What the hell ? Did you get lap-band surgery or something ? You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh . Okay . Sister . Wife . [Both_laugh] Hey , roddy , you want a beer ? No , I got to go to church . I'm gon na need hard alcohol . No shots . Oh , for you , my dear , the world and more . Mwah ! [Laughs] Look at the two of us ... the troll and the supermodel . It's almost as if my reward , for the punishment of me having to be me , is marrying you and then having you transform into this . [Laughs] All right , you Saint Bernard , stop slobbering . So , mom wanted me to come out here to see if you're gon na come to midnight mass . She wants to leave early to get a good seat . Well , no . I am in too good a mood to relocate to a place that will alter that mood , thank you . Are you about to reveal a priestly molestation story ? Uh , I will if it means I don't have to go . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shit out of you . Dare you . [Laughs] We're leaving in 15 . Uh , I don't even ... How ? The hard way ... diet and dedication . She just got tired of carrying around the extra pounds . Extra pounds ? Extra person . Dude , it's my sister . No , I grew up with your sister . That person who was just here I have never met . I mean , she weighed two bills in junior high . Now she's like the female subway sandwich guy . Do not say that to her . [Clears_throat] Say what you will , you can't stop me from fucking her in my mind . Oh , God . Melissa looks great . How's her acting classes going ? Ugh . Unfortunately , no one's ever written a book called "" don't follow your dreams . "" [Laughter] I'm gon na . That book will fucking change the world . Chapter 1 ... choosing the wrong dream will just fuck you up . [Laughs] You know , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to football camp for two weeks every summer to get better ? Yes . Did my dad run drills with me before going to work ? Yes . Did my mom make special meals to help me manage my weight ? Yes . And did I make the football team ? No , and it crushed me . It ... it crushed me , and I-i just don't want her to be crushed . I think it's great that she's found something that makes her feel useful . Walk a mile , Deb . Walk a mile in my timberlands and then report back . [Bell_tolling] I thought I was marrying a size-12 retail buyer , and then , out of nowhere , at 33 years old , just some hibernating acting dream just sprouts up out of nowhere ? I mean , I'm glad she got into shape , but , seriously , this delusion that she's gon na be an actress has just taken ahold of her like some insatiable fungus that is devouring the common-sense part of her brain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You'll see . Why does this news make me sad ? For myself , not you . When you find a girl you want to spend the rest of your life with , you'll ask her . Dom . D-d-dom . D-d-dom . No . Thank you . Well , what if I already found her and she wanted no part of me ? Well , you write some songs and you move on . In theory . I remember last summer , we talked on the phone for an hour about what you were gon na do when you saw her at your buddy heisner's wedding . Oh , yeah , that wedding got moved to Montana . My credit cards are all maxed out . I never got to go , never got to confront . Well , give it another nine years . That's the plan . Isn't she married ? Like that matters . Yeah . Burn it . It's salvageable . What about this date you got wandering around my mother's kitchen on Christmas Eve ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , luckily , I'm still in the enigma phase with her . She hasn't caught on to how useless I am as a man . Not that I'm gon na clue her in just yet . The sex is too good . Yeah , that is when I close my eyes and can't see her looking back at me chock-full of expectation and hope . [Indistinct_conversations] It's beautiful . [Laughs] Can I ask you something ? When did you know that my brother was the right one for you ? You mean when did I fall in love with him ? No , that's not always the same thing . For me , it was . He let my father's barbershop quartet teach him to sing . [Laughs] No . Dom has a horrible voice . Yeah , I know . He knows . But it was so important to my dad , it's like the one important thing , and dom recognized that . So , there he was in the kitchen with my father's barbershop-quartet friends , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause it's the one low voice that you could possibly get away with . Not if you're tone-deaf . [Both_laugh] I know . And I just stood there baffled at my good fortune . And I thought , "" I'm really in "" love with this guy . "" That's so sweet ... And specific . What about you and roddy ? Oh , I don't know . I was smoking so much pot back then , I can't remember . No , we , uh ... we met at this weight-loss thing , and he was all goofy and persistent . And I don't know . Well , you know , if there's any true tradition on the guy's part , for the girl , the whole proposal thing is kind of like a sneak attack . They know they're gon na do it , but you don't know they're gon na do it , and then they do it and it's great , but you're ... You're , like , all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roddy and I were engaged , she sighed . Right before , "" honey "" , "" congratulations , "" it was , like , this slight-yet-audible sigh , as if to say , "" thank God my fat "" daughter squeaked in . "" [Laughs] Your mother adores you . Oh , no , I know . I'm fine . I don't think about it . That's a line . [Laughs] That's just my mom . That's how she reacted , bless her heart . To mom , marriage equals happiness . Oh . Mom , what's wrong ? I forgot to hang dad's stocking . Santa doesn't come till we're asleep . [Sighing] Oh . Nothing like the nurturing smell of Providence back in your nasal passages , huh ? The wafting stench of the broken dreams of losers , like myself , stuck here , incapable of leaving this shithole . Still love Rhode island , huh ? Ugh ! Why don't you pack up the truck and drive yourself across state lines . It's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big apple , where I'll find true love and artistic reward ? Anything but this . Because I know a guy who moved away six years ago with Hemingway aspirations , who took a dive and became a physical therapist . There you go . There's a dig . You know what , kev ? Every Christmas for the last seven years , we have the same conversation . We have some beers , we have some [laughs] , and then without fail , you start bitching about being stuck here like you're on Alcatraz . Oh , Mr . getting-married-guy has finished all his thinking on all the big thoughts . He's got his how-to guidebook on how things work ? And he's got a few tips , huh ? Yeah . Watch what you say about my fianc ? e and watch what you say about my sister . They were compliments . You know , you come in here and you dismiss my engagement with some "" are you sure ? "" Bullshit . You make some crude comments about the fuckability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister ? I was joking . Find another way to joke . It's not funny anymore . Walk it off , dom . Dude , look at yourself ... Shit-faced and stoned . It's Christmas ! Burying your talent , dragging around some poor girl who you're gon na give the boot to with your well-rehearsed , fake sorry . "" You're too good for me . "" Congratulations . You've gotten back all of womankind for the one that you didn't get . Do you know what friends do ? Bitching is what friends do together . May I remind you that your first and only published short story is entitled "" Providence sucks "" ? You're being a fucking asshole . That's why I came over ! The pleasure of your company has always been that I could act like an asshole without getting reamed for it . All good times have to come to an end , right ? Oh . Hmm . Awesome , dude . Hey ! Put in that your book . I'm glad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m glad that you're so fucking complete that my meaningless bitches now bore you . Good luck with your speaking tour . Merry fucking Christmas . [Sighs] Mary , wake up ! We're leaving ! All : * sing in exultation * word of the father * now in flesh appearing * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * Christ the lord feel free to spread out all over the grounds while you write . Just be in hearing range . When I ring this bell , you should make your way back here for our next talk . Tell one another your vision of what you want your shared future to be . Okay . I know you're gon na make a great dad . I like thinking about that ... How you'll create a home where our kids will prosper . And you'll love them and teach them and provide for them , and it's powerful thinking about that and watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . I-I'm not finished . Oh . I want to be a mom . You'll be an amazing mom . Sometimes , I feel like I won't be the kind of great mom that I want to be ... I disagree . And like I won't be the kind of mom that can constantly get on top of things and , you know , to be a mom that doesn't lose my mind . We'll get you some valium . [Laughs] You know , it worked for my mother . Did it ? [Laughs] Not really . I don't know . I just ... I see my cousin so stressed and snippy with tom ... yeah , that's different people . That's different situations . Yeah , but do you remember that time when she was loading Lucy and Brian into the van at hersheypark ? Yeah . [Laughs] Yeah . I mean , she was ... she was screaming at them and ... and they weren't listening and they were all over the place and she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired and overwhelmed . She was wild , like ferocious wild , like ... like some instinctual altered state that must have been induced by childbearing . You're ... you're not your cousin . Yeah , but she wasn't always like that . I'm not tom . You are Debbie . I'm ... trying to change the subject . No . I'm trying to end the comparison . I mean , they are they , and we are we . * you are not your cousin please don't sing . * and I am not tom [bell_ringing] Never too late to be saved by a bell . * you , my dear Debbie , will be a great mom * you didn't read yours . I basically wrote everything I just said ... Up until the singing , of course . [All_scatting] Man , you got it . You got it ! You still want me to sing with you guys ? Yes ! You're incredible . Gentlemen ... No more . We've got a wedding to plan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deejay over here on the stage . Or ... If you want , uh , Maggie row's son is in a band called destiny that plays all over Syracuse . Yeah , I-i don't want Steve row playing at wedding . No , I don't know . We could go hear him , you know . No , Steve row gave me a wedgie in the fifth grade . What ? He was flirting with you . Yeah , I'll go give his old man a wedgie right now . What ? With your barbershop quartet ? If needs be . You know , Harry can rumble . No , if you did the lighting in here , this place could be awesome . That's what we thought . Yeah , I was in charge of my senior prom . We turned , uh , the gym into a 1920s jazz hall . I always thought that this place would make a great speakeasy . The bridesmaids could be flappers ! Hey , wait a minute . Johnny marr has a bubble machine ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Definitely doable . Their pensions got decimated . I can't take their money . I need to generate more income . Hey , you're gon na get that job on Tuesday , okay ? I know it . [Both_laugh] Part of the reason that our church does this program is our experience with couples who get challenged by the shift between marriage as an idea and marriage as a relationship . 1-in-10 couples who participate in this decide not to move forward with their wedding because of issues that come up over this weekend . And you know what ? That's okay , because this weekend is about exploring one thing ... what makes this love you have for the person you sit next to a love that will thrive ? What ... what makes this love that ... that you bring to the marriage table one that will conquer all ? Yes ! Uh , high score . [Laughter] We here at the engagement encounter believe that communication is not just saying what you want and demanding that the other person agree . When we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of being a mom , but I had difficulty letting go of my career . Mike was gone for long stretches , and I used to think to myself , "" well , this isn't "" what I thought it would be like ... waiting around for a five-minute phone call every couple of days or shuttling the kids around while he was off in Chicago or Kansas City or Boston , meeting interesting "" people . "" Pharmaceutical reps aren't interesting . [Laughter] Don't let things fester . This is the time for really taking off the masks and showing who you really are . Boo . Can I read this thing I didn't read a second ago ? Of course . I don't know why I didn't read it . I-I ... I guess I'm embarrassed . I , um ... about what ? About how un-useful so much of what I'm ... I'm skilled at has turned out to be . Deb , you're not your job . You talk about being a physical therapist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and ... and you're right . I'm a physical therapist . I have a degree in marketing . Which has gotten you good jobs and good benefits . Job benefits aren't life benefits . Sure they are . Before I got laid off , I never really had to examine what I was doing to define my life . You know , I-i ... I don't know . I moved to New York to work in publishing . Publishing ... a dying industry . And ... and , you know , and I took these jobs tangentially related to that because I thought I was gon na ... I was gon na pay my dues , and I did . You're 25 years old . Exactly . I'm 25 years old . I'm ... I'm four years out of college . Maybe I should work in the red cross or something like you talk about . I just don't want to feel like I'm stuck somewhere with nothing to offer . I'm not gon na let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really nice , but , uh ... but there's nothing . Okay . I appreciate your time . Uh , do you know who might be hiring ? I mean , I check the online boards , and everything looks so crappy . I-I thought you were hiring . [Laughs] Interviewing . We just have a hiring freeze . When there's an interview freeze , that's when things get really bad ... not just bad-bad , but really bad . But some people say that things are turning around . Others say that it's going back in the dumper and that this recent rally was just a trap , and we may have to gnaw off our limbs just to survive . I mean , metaphorical limbs , but real enough to hurt . I just keep reassuring myself that somebody needs me . But do you ever feel that what you have to offer just isn't enough ? Not until recently . Hmm . Thank you for your time . [Siren_walls] You feel all right ? Good . Paging Dr . menter . Paging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving . I hate it . I hate coming here . I hate seeing you . Well , the day after tomorrow , we'll hate some more . If I don't kill myself first . [Laughs] I'll call to confirm . Hold her head underwater next time . I promise I won't tell . I heard that . My lungs are better than yours , Freddy , you cigarette-smoking prick . [Indistinct_conversations] , [horns_honking] Sister Mary Roberts ! It's me , Christine . Oh , sister Mary Roberts , you look great . I'm sorry . I'm not ... how was your mission in Guatemala ? Uh , still a lot of pagans there , I believe , right ? The ... the numbers have dwindled , but we're ... we're making progress . Oh , people would worship anything , wouldn't they ? Look at us here . Look at all the odd stuff . But still , it is comforting . Besides , you have to bet on something , especially at my age . [Chuckles] I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s so nice to see you back at our parish . We need more people here with your devotion . God bless . Oh ! Seriously , stop . Come on . Give it back . Jennifer , if he hurts me , I want you to be my therapist .

Oh , hey , tonight , at the therapy pool , annual naked cannonball competition . Who's in ? Besides Jen . Look , this is an annual thing , Jen , where you get in the pool where we heal people and turn it into a cannonball frolic . [Laughs] Dom , you take it easy . You take a load off .

It was a bad way to be introduced , stumbling across me crying in a stairwell . Hey , it's a hospital . We're used to people crying . Not some silly girl weeping over some dumb dude I fell in love with . Yeah . Has he called back yet ? He says he's still confused . Screw him . That was the goal , at least one last time . [Both_laugh] Well , it's a half day for me . I got to go pick out a wedding cake . Oh , don't get one with a lot of flowers . That's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosting petals . My sister got real flowers to sprinkle on top . It looked just as nice . Cost less . Good tip . [Both_laugh] Uh , more people like chocolate than vanilla . Keep the tips coming . Much obliged . [Indistinct_conversations] [Siren_walls] [Door_opens] Hey ! Hi . You're home early . Took a half day from work to meet you at turnover's . Remember ? Oh , my God . I left you a bunch of messages . I just figured your phone died . I'm so sorry . I-I turned off my phone , and then I guess I forgot I turned off my phone . It's okay . I'm sorry , dom . You've got to try this , okay ? Oh , my God . You're not mad at me ? No . I'm saving my anger for something ... Important . [Both_laugh] Oh , my God , that's really good . Isn't that incredible ? [Laughs] How much ? Well , they're $600 or we can get the same cake . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , less sugar . That's right . I've seen that . Haven't you ? Where do you come up with these amazing ideas ? [Laughs] You taste like cake . So do you . [Laughs] Ah , leave it . How do I make you see what I see ? How do I make you want what I want ? That door . That door you're thinking about going through ... it's a real door . It's a real door that will shut all by itself once you go through it . Can't you see that ? You can make the wrong move . You can twist your fate . You can take a road that you think is right and awaken and find that it's all wrong . It's all ... Wrong . Don't you understand what I'm saying ? Love me . Love me . [Crying] Love me . [Cheers_and_applause] Easy on the applause . We're trying to stay in the scene and do strong work , not perform for results or applause . Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments you were pushing . I just got a little caught up . [Laughs] If you're gon na do all the feeling for us , we don't have to feel at all , right ? We can just kick back and detach . We don't have to participate , right ? We can just judge whether or not your display of emotion is authentic . And we're gon na do that regardless . [Laughter] But there's mystery if you give us room to lean in a little , to participate , to wonder . At the moment when your heart is breaking , I want to see you trying desperately to not cry . I won't make that mistake again . [Laughs] Class is the place for mistakes . Mistakes lead us to deeper truths . You dug deep . Nice work . See you all Friday . [Indistinct_conversations] [Sniffles] Oh . What a nice surprise ! I texted you . I was looking for tuxedos a few blocks from here . I thought you could come along , help make sure I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone off in class . I didn't get the text . I'm sorry . Hey , this is my class . Yeah . This is my teacher , James . James , this is dom , my brother . I was telling him about you . Oh , hey , man . Nice to meet you . Yeah , you too . You're the reason she got started here , right ? Yeah , I bought her a birthday present of some acting classes , you know , wherever she wanted to take them . Well , we're glad she chose here . Did you catch that last scene ? Yeah , I caught the end , and I got to tell you ... I was not detached at all . I was absorbed and fully into it . Good . That's what we're going for . But nice to meet you . We shall see you Friday . Okay . Incredible . Thanks . Your teacher's taken quite a shine to you . He's proud . Proud and grabby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . You ? My showcase is coming up . James thinks I'm gon na get an agent . I can't go . We got to get mom to move here . Yeah , she can chaperone you in acting class . It's good . He's like that with everyone . It's more ironic than actual . I don't know what that means . Well , I can't explain it then . Yeah . Just watch out , okay ? I think I saw him trying to undo your bra strap . [Both_laugh] You know , would it kill you to let me be the pretty girl for once ? Okay .

Uh , you mean , uh , do I want to be cooped up in a tiny apartment , which I can't afford , in a city without friends , while my two adult children are busy with their lives ? No . I'm never too busy for you . Oh , yes , you are , and it's okay . You've got your own life . I do miss you and your sister and I wish you lived closer . I miss being a parent and , you know , having influence in your lives . I think I would be so much better at it now . Yeah , I-i know more . Mom , stop . That conversation that we had at Christmas ? I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how I handled ... you handled it as well as you could have . I did it badly . No . Trying to get you to feel joy about some idea about ultimately being reunited with daddy in heaven . There's nothing joyful about a boy losing his father . You did great . Seriously . We were all in the same boat , and we did great . I mean it . I couldn't have landed a girl like Deb without being raised by a mom like you , could I ? You sweetie . Want some fluff ? No . Some cocoa ? * I can't be clear , but all I want to say * * I'm a wreck since the day you've gone * * I try to fit things together , and it seeps through * * it doesn't seem to matter what I do * * I'm useless without you , dear * * I'm useless without you * my dear [cheers_and_applause] Great show , man . Thanks . I should have minded my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . You should play that last one at our reception . I'm invited ? Yeah , if you be my best man . You got really low standards , you know ? Yeah , I do . Hey , don't go wasting your vow on me . [Laughs] To friendship and longevity , to forgiveness and to an elimination of jackassery , except for occasional glimpses that harm no one . Cheers . Cheers . Mary ? [Laughs] What ? Is that Mary ? Yes . Things sort of fell apart after Christmas . So , I get to host the bachelor party . Oh . Seriously . Oh , rest yourself . Rest yourself , son . It's gon na be all taken care of . Don't you think about a thing . There will be no shenanigans . There may be drunken ... there will be drunkenness , but there will be no shenanigans . Do you understand ? There ... there's gon na be drunkenness . I got you . Your voice sounded great tonight , by the way , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no tobacco . Nice ! Good for you . That's good . Yeah . Well , this is my problem . I never thought I was designing a wee little life with tiny victories like not smoking pot for consecutive days or finally posting my songs on a website for people to disparage . Your songs about Betsy kill me . [Chuckles] I'm serious . You know , that song you wrote about sister Julie's English class says more in three minutes about growing up than I ever could in a novel . Oh ... No , no , no . Maybe ... maybe a song you write helps someone ... Miserable existence . Make sense out of their life , you know ? Mm . You just ... you got to ... you got to just progress with that in your mind , you know ? Maybe it's time I came down to New York . There you go . Betsy just got divorced . Congratulations . [Both_laugh] Okay . Wow . We continue with an exercise called awareness . It's designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have differences in . As we read off some statements , we want you to move to the other side of the lawn if you agree with what that statement says . If you disagree , stay put . Mike , you want to kick us off ? Thank you , father . You ready ? "" I always squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom of the tube . "" [Both_laugh] I guess . Uh , what if you buy toothpaste that comes in that upright pump thingy ? Well , be thankful that you have one less thing to argue about . Okay , you can go back to your starting point . "" I prefer red wine to white wine . "" "" I like to vacation alone sometimes . "" "" I would be willing to move "" "" to advance my spouse's career . "" Where are you going ? With you . Injured people are everywhere . "" I would like to have kids . "" [Laughter] "" I would like to have more "" "" than two kids . "" Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoping yours , but I'm open . [Laughs] Okay . [Laughs] Let's do another one . "" Going to church regularly is important to me . "" Okay , try and recall when you and your fianc ? are on opposite sides . Those may be areas to discuss . I mean , obviously , toothpaste is not as important as how many kids you want . Okay , that'll be it for today . I've been going to church . [Birds_squawking] Hi , Emma . [Chuckles] Oh , thank you for the invite tonight , but , um , I'm actually meeting up with this guy I went to college with . My mother thinks I should go . She said it would be good medicine for me to talk to somebody who knew me way back when . [Chuckles] I don't know . I should probably just blow it off . I don't really feel like good company these days , and from what I recall , neither was he . Oh , yeah , good idea . [Laughs] Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Okay . Talk to you tomorrow . Bye . [Ringing] [Beep] Dom , it's roddy , man . I don't even know where the hell I am right now . I was at the javits center doing demos , and my bag with all my shit got ripped off . My fucking wallet , my keys , my laptop just gone . Uh , I was doing a demo for that douche-bag sales guy Craig derno . He said he was gon na watch my bag , but he did not , and now I'm stranded . So , please . Uh , I've tried to call Melissa , but she's at class till late night , so I'm walking to your place , man . Deb , I've been with you every Sunday for the last year and a half . During the week . I've been going during the week . When ? Most days . Most ? Yeah , lately . For how long have you been doing this ? About six ... about eight weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . [Hard-rock_music_playing] [Knock_on_door] Yeah ! Coming ! Oh , Kevin . Roddy . Hey . Oh , you making lasagna ? Uh ... R-roddy ? So , dom just lent you his keys , even after the Christmas dust-up ? I'm helping a friend lay down some demos in Brooklyn . You don't have one of those fake rocks that you hide a key in ? No . Uh , I have a brother-in-law who has a spare key somewhere , but at this point , I'll probably just wait till Melissa's acting class lets out and then head back with her . Yeah , what time is that ? 11:00 . Mm . On a Friday night ? Dude , don't poke the bear . Trust me ... I am already overchafed about the situation . Hey , who's that chippy you got coming over ? Just a friend from college . I'll lend you 20 bucks for a bus back to Jersey . I 'd have you stay , but I'm just not sure that I got enough for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , every day that I asked you how your day was , never once did you say , "" I spent "" it in church . "" I don't spend the day . I-I go to mass . I-I walked by the church one day and I went in and I found something about the ritual that I really missed , something that I had when I was a kid and a teenager . I went to a jesuit college even . Yeah , but hold on . This might be all easier to choke down if I 'd observed your religious re-awakening in incremental portions , instead of having it , you know , thrust on me here at catholic camp . I mean , come on , Deb . I thought we were on the same page . I'm sorry I sprung it on you . I ... Do you want to leave ? Not without you . Are you sure ? Deb , stop saying that , okay ? I'm here , I'm participating , I'm doing all the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m reading what I wrote , am I not ? You are . I want to go to bed on my deluxe 3-inch mattress in my warm and cozy four-star dormitory . Hey . Man . What ? She was finished . Look , I'm sorry about your divorce . Well , you can't convince someone to fix a mistake if they don't think that they've made one . Debatable . You know why my marriage works ? I-I'm becoming more and more intrigued . Because I am blind to the alternative . Still here , still here , still here , still here , still here . I love you . [Beep] You see , it's way too easy to leave somebody nowadays , you know ? Friends of friends , families , everyone everywhere ... everyone is way too understanding of other people's , you know , reasons to leave . You can't judge other people's ... oh , sure you can . You do . We all do . Most people just don't do it out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a good old dosage of some out-loud , full-frontal condemnation in this world . It works . Take my buddy freitsel from umass . He got married a while ago . I went , you know , and I listened to the priest give a homily about how the guests at the wedding were witnesses , but , more importantly , they were sentinels . You know , we are standing guard over that wedded couple . You know , we got the watch , and we are on watch forever . So , last summer , freitsel calls . You know , he says he's having some trouble with bridget ... That's his wife's name ... you know , and ... but , you know , friction , you know , kind of hinting that it might be unfixable . So I'm like , "" oh , buddy , you "" know , hang in there , man . "" It's gon na be all right . "" You know , the usual . But I told dom , and dom's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm like , "" why ? "" And he said , "" go be a sentinel . "" And he was right . Boom ! I drive over to freitsel's place , I sit him down , and I said , "" I can not let you do this . "" You can not give up . "" I owe you this . "" Who wants coffee ? I'll get it . And he's like ... he's like , "" hey , roddy , lay off , man . I'm only human . "" I'm like , "" you're only human ? ! "" So what ? You're only required to work it out if you're a klingon ? Only Mr . Spock's got to dig "" deep ? "" I says , "" guy , your humanity is "" not in dispute here . "" Your humanity is the problem . "" You really got this judging thing down . Look , I'm just saying ... you know , at first , he was resistant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stayed . And now they are thriving . Thriving . [Echoing] Thriving . Hey , uh , are you getting a wi-fi signal down here ? Nope . I'm typing some notes out tonight . Is ... is there gon na be a test ? That is a cool blouse . Oh , thank you . I wasn't sure how to dress . Yeah , I thought it might be dressy , but it's kind of like summer camp . For Jesus freaks . I like it . I mean , some of it's kind of hard , but I feel like it's making us closer . Well , I feel like I'm a grown-up , and it's all a little too instructive and rah-rah for me . Oh , could I borrow some of your ... Yeah . Mm-hmm . Dental floss . Thank you . You're welcome . You know , I'm getting a lot out of it , too . I feel closer to my fianc ? . Hey , uh , dom ? Philip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , thanks . We could really take some money from these jokers . I'm good . Okay . [Chuckles] Are you catholic ? No , but my fianc ? is , so I'm dealing . He promised me reciprocity-free oral if I made it through . Whatever . Forced conversation is not my bag . And neither are these Halloween decorations hanging everywhere . I mean , what kind of sick shit is this ? I get it ... he ... he died on the cross for our sins . Awesome . I don't need to be haunted by his blood and guts hanging out everywhere . [Knock_on_door] Tracy , are you in there ? I'll be there in a second , Chad . Geez ! I'll be in the car . Are you okay ? What happened ? [Sighs] My fianc ? keeps saying he doesn't know why he signed up for this . He doesn't know why we can't sleep in the same bed . We're both adults . And he is miserable . [Breathes_deeply] And so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from okay . We can leave if we want to ? [Snoring] There's a church on 82nd street that Lindsay told me about . Wait , wait , wait . When did church come back into the equation ? You've suffered through enough of our friends's weddings in churches . What's one more ? Especially if it's gon na alleviate some of the stress of planning . Look , it's not as easy as , "" hey , let us use your church for free . "" There are rules . I mean , they have this program called pre-cana , where they ... They basically need to approve you . It actually sounded kind of nice . They ... they have this retreat called engagement encounter . [Chuckles] We get to go away for the weekend . An entire weekend ? [Snoring_continues] [Sighs] [Crickets_chirping] [Snoring_continues] Dom . I went to leave you a note , and , um ... You found my journal and you asked , "" what would Jesus do ? "" Do you want to be with her instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word "" could . "" "" Could "" as in you wanted to or "" could "" as in if the circumstances were different ? Unbelievable . Do you want the circumstances to be different ? No . You can be honest with me . When have I not been honest with you ? These things that you wrote ... I was doing my three pages a day . I was flushing it out . I was putting it on the page unfiltered , like the book that you gave me suggested . I'm just interested where these thoughts about her came along and when you thought it was okay to write them in your journal ? ! Look , I'm here with you , okay ? What good is being here with me when you're writing about some slut you work with . She's not a slut . You're defending her ? No . I'm being honest . She made a pass at you . She tried to . I wasn't there . Well , it seems like you were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I don't know . You tell me , Nancy drew . Just before easter . Okay , can we step ... it's documented , babe ! Can we just move away from the building ? No , it is documented , okay ? Everybody from work had Thursday night drinks . I pushed her away . After you lured her to make a move . What are you talking about ? You made her a mix . Yes , I made her a mix of tunes that I listen to at work . Don't you see how I can interpret that as cultivating intimacy ? No , I didn't think of your interpretation , because I was like , "" here are those tunes . "" And she was like , "" thanks . "" So , while I'm at home trying to find my next shitty temp job , you're off ... what ? Road-testing my replacement ? I'm telling you ... I'm not . Then what was with the bath oils ? Oh , this is insane ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see how that's kind of fucked up ? I was her secret Santa . So buy her a pad of post-it notes , buy her , you know , a new ace bandage , something that ... That physical therapists buy for one another , not some Spanish-fly sex kit for her to rub all over her breasts . I thought it was a nice gift . You liked the one's my mom bought for you . You bought some for Karen . You talked about it for 15 minutes over dinner with Bob and Stacy . You said you loved it . So ? Yeah , I loved it because I was amazed at how something so simple could make me feel so relaxed and cared for and girly . And then we had an amazing night of lovemaking after you drew a bath for me to try the bath oils in . And then you go and buy her the same fucking bath oils ? ! She ... she just started working there , okay ? I found her in the stairwell crying because her boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you to marry me . I was feeling so lucky . But for her , it was shaping up to be a pretty shitty holiday season . So when I picked her name out of a hat the next day , I decided it would be nice for me to buy her something nice . So I went to Duane reade and dropped $12 and spread some holiday cheer . So you gave her a shoulder to cry on , some advice on love , a mix tape to listen to while she rubs her bath oils all over her naked body , and she adds up these gestures as an invitation to fall for you , which she does , and then she lets this be known , all gooey-eyed and ... and gushy with her lips parted , which sends you swooning and swirling and ... she was crying in the stairwell . Oh , my God ! And I bet she was all "" sniffle "" , "" sniffle , "" and you were all , "" there , there . "" Okay , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You're putting things together , and they don't go together that way . But things you wrote ! Yes , the things I wrote ! Whatever was in my journal had a right to be there , and you had none . Uh ... Take $20 . No , man . I don't want to take your strip-club stash . [Both_laugh] All right , seriously , we're just gon na go for a walk . You okay ? I'm fine . I'm gon na go down to where her acting classes are . She usually gets ... [Yawning] Coffee around the corner . Um ... Her friends ... oh , God , her friends . [Chuckles] They're so self-centered . They never ask me a question about how I am doing , but alas , yet again , I am in a situation where I have to suck it up and deal , so ... Thank you for dinner . Yeah . And thank you for conversation . Sometimes misfortune leads to a nice night , right ? That's a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful people . Oh . You're adorable . You're the most adorable of the two . Okay , bye . [Crickets_chirping] You still wear that necklace what's-his-fuck gave you , right ? What has that got to ... because we're discussing cultivating thoughts of intimacy . My wearing this necklace is not cultivating thoughts of intimacy with Gary Thompson . Talk to Gary Thompson ? I saw him a couple months ago . Oh , really ? Where ? Church ? I saw him outside a diner . So , why didn't you mention that to me ? "" Oh , hey , I had lunch with Gary Thompson . "" We didn't have lunch . Oh , have lunch , split a burger , throw back some brews , have a soulful visit . I had a coffee . He's still friends with a bunch of my friends from Georgetown . He is a dirtbag who stole money from you , and yet , you still feel the need to cozy up and reminisce . Hey , congratulations , by the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here doing a recording . Oh , for a friend for free . What ? Like I'm painting ? For years of art classes , preparing me for anything but a desk job , and what am I doing ? You're in human resource . You are a resource for humans to reference their humanity . Yeah , well , I thought it was just a phase , and now , seven years later , somehow a phase has become my life . You've been through a lot . Other people have been through worse . It matches the bracelet you bought for me . Before I knew fuck-face bought it for you five years ago . It's just a necklace . And it's just a journal , thoughts . Thoughts come and go . I mean , do you pray out loud at the kitchen table for me to listen in ? No ? Why ? Why all the secrets , huh ? This is different . This is different . If you think this matters to me ... I mean , you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could give a shit . It's fake ! Well , don't Chuck the bracelet , ' cause that's real . How real are your feelings for her ? Words on a page . Words buried by other words , words you may not have had a chance to get to tonight , words about us , about our wedding , about how much of a good thing I have with you . Did you read that ? That's in there , too . Did you read what I wrote yesterday before we came to this godforsaken place ? Didn't you read all the things I wrote about you ? How we doing over here ? Oh , fucking phenomenal , father . Thank you . Nine years . Back of a burger king . I welled up . You walked off . Back of a burger king . How sad is that ? It was a long time ago . It was a nightmare . Torch-carrying fool . I had a boyfriend . You always had a boyfriend . [Laughs] We were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is my one-step recovery program , apologizing to you face-to-face for putting you in that situation ... And then abandoning our friendship when I didn't get what I wanted in return . And ... I was an ass . It has impacted me more than you could possibly know . And ... Still . I'm sorry . There . I said it . God . Of course , it took me nine years . I was married for half of those nine years . I wasn't always up for chatting , especially about the past . Hey , should we get more alcohol ? Actually , I'm trying to cut back . Ugh . I tried to keep a straight face . [Laughs] But I really like alcohol . [Laughs] Can we start with a prayer ? No , I'm not in the mood for praying . And , honestly , father ... You ... I mean , not you personally , but the collective you ... have been fucking up my shit for a long fucking time . I'm really sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I'm sorry . I'm sorry for swearing . I-I-i don't mean any disrespect . Thank you for taking some time . How have we been fucking up your shit ? Making me go to confession when I was 8 . Let's start there . What sin does an 8-year-old need to confess ? You 'd be surprised . When I was an altar boy , I dropped a communion wafer and got cuffed so hard by the priest that my ear rang for two days . Dom , he's trying to help . No , just ... just ... just so we're clear . You can't drop them , but you can put them in your mouth and chew them . I can understand how bewildering that could be ... no , no , no . Bewildering is our parish priest telling me , when I was 12 , that my father's death was my cross to bear for the rest of my life . Jesus only had to carry the cross for a couple hours , and he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like that prize package . Faith is a struggle . Thi is a struggle . This is a struggle . I-I-i came here because I thought it was the right thing to do , but now it is clear that it was absolutely the wrong thing to do , because we were getting along great before the church came into it . And you people , with your , uh ... Identifying of obstacles . You fucking create obstacles . I left a note in his journal . It was supposed to be a surprise . Oh , yeah , it was a real surprise , all right . [Sighs] You know , father , I had faith when I was a kid ' cause I ate what was put on my plate . And then , well , you know , loved one gets struck down by a Chevy impala , and you don't even get a drunk driver to blame . Just some icy roads , bad luck , and a dead dad . And it makes no sense . But you people tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in paradise , that he planned it that way . You told me to find purpose in the pain . Losing a parent can be painful . And I didn't tell you this to give you some sort of "" aha "" moment , some revelation to unlock the mystery of me . My dad died . I bummed out . I got over it . Losing your faith is not uncommon ... I didn't lose my faith . It didn't deliver what it said it would . And upon further reflection , I decided to treat it the same way it treated me ... with contempt . You tell me to pray to God when things are good , pray to God when things are bad , and be happy with whatever answer he gives you . Here's what I've learned so far . Everything is arbitrary . Most things aren't easy . Fucked-up shit happens to a lot of people , so just pray it doesn't happen to you . But what does all this have to do with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in an ever-changing religion that has cut and pasted as it sees fit , but she can't place her faith in me . And all I've done to prove to you that I am dedicated , to show you that my actions speak louder than words . Why can't she ... why can't she have faith in me ? I just don't know when I became the type of person who gets in these situations . You felt something real and you followed it . I know that sounds like acting-school garbage , but it just happens to be true . What this is , what we have ... I've never had it before . Everything you say makes him sound like a jerk . I haven't told you the ways in which he's been nice . When has he ever been nice ? He loved me when I was ugly . How many TV shows do you think you need to see to know that you shouldn't cheat on your wife at home , because she just might walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and they're going at it . And at first , I couldn't even assemble the pictures . Then I screamed , made a scene , took all of her things , and threw them in the hallway . I smashed his laptop on the floor , and I knew he didn't back that shit up , like , ever . And then I was like , "" what the "" fuck ? "" That was my moment of eloquence . My entire marriage had been upended , and all I could come up with was , "" what the fuck ? "" What 'd he say ? He shrugged . How do you go from a vow to a shrug ? I can hardly profess to know you both . The fact that you're here , talking this out , even shouting this out , rather than running ... Well , that , to me , is a manifestation of God's presence . Rely on it . There's a lot of muscularity to your words ... from both of you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , you know , sometimes it is . Be gentle with one another , look for the good and noble in one another , look for the reason why you want to get married . Write it out , shout it out , share it . It's okay to try hard . It's okay to feel like you're trying hard . You know , in the mass , we talk about how Jesus wanted to carry some of our struggle and our hurt . Invite him to do so . I hope I see you tomorrow . [Door_opens] , closes Debbie . [Paper_thuds] I'm sorry . I'm dragging down the whole night . Oh , but you're doing it so well . [Laughs] My mom says that I have to stop it with the angst . She considers anything that she doesn't want to have to listen to as angst . Your husband betrayed you . [Chuckles] If processing a heartbreak's now considered angst , then there's no hope for any of us . [Laughs] But , uh ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid shit that I need to deal with . Love ain't stupid shit . Wanting something with another person that is lasting and true is an elemental yearning . I think a friend of mine told me that , recently , even . But it's true , right ? It's not stupid shit . I just want to meet a good guy . Like , it doesn't matter if he's from a good family . I'll start my own good family , but I can't start without the guy . [Chuckles] And I'm not saying that I only identify myself in juxtaposition to a guy . I just ... I like guys . [Laughs] I-I'm a fan of the whole guy-girl thing . [Both_laugh] I'm not , like , trolling for a rhodes scholar ... just a guy , just a grown-man guy , a guy that I don't have to support and pay his student loans while he flakes out and has sex with other people , a consistent guy who does his guy thing and doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy who's nice and ... Occasionally attentive . Hi . [Chuckles] I am so in love with you . I am so fucking in love with you that I can not contain myself . And I know that you are wounded and hurting and fucked up still over this guy , but I have spent the whole entire night staring at you , and the only reason that I came down here was to get lost in your face and try to do what I just did . So if you think that I'm an ass for doing that , I will totally understand . * blow out the candles on your cake , little darling * * mother is here now don't you shake , little darling * * ain't no bad girl gon na take my little darling from where he belongs * * ooh , ooh-ooh , ooh . Debbie ... Baby , I love you . Despite above and beyond all this , I love you . Let's go home . Let's just get out of here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started going to church "" because I had doubts about marrying you , doubts about myself in a marriage , bringing into it what's needed , doubts about this being the right thing , if we're right together . And I read your journal because I wanted to know if you had the same doubts , because maybe if you did , I-I 'd know that we 'd be okay because we 'd need each other to build on what we love about one another and ... and cast any doubts away . I'm all upside down and I couldn't decipher whether that was ... that was real fear or just jitters , and ... and I "" didn't know how to say that . "" You wanted ... you wanted confirmation on your doubt ? To see if it was shared ? That's why you read it ? Just to see if you were scared or uncertain at all . You started praying because , some months ago , you realized that you might not love me ? I prayed because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fairy godmother . If you don't love me , you can't pray yourself into it . I wasn't trying to do that . I know that I'm not the only one that you might think is awesome , and maybe she was more awesome ... oh , she's not more awesome than you . [Laughs] This stupid book . This stupid fucking book is not me . What have I not done ? Tell me . What am I not showing you ? I have a good job . I have a good place for us . I have good plans . I have a good heart . Just tell me . You doubt us . You doubt us and you took this journal and you used to hang the responsibility on my shoulders . You wanted to know if I have doubts , so you go looking for doubt and you ... you find some ramblings and you call those ramblings truth and you dismiss the truth that I pledged to you . And then you have this ... this weepy revelation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what ? Take the car . [Keys_jingle] I'll find my own way home . [Crying] [Door_slams] Dom . Uh , I'm sorry about last night . Oh , it's cool . I wish I could say it was the alcohol , but it isn't . It's ... no , I-it's fine . Really . Okay . [Both_laugh] Let's get this shit over with . [Crickets_chirping] [Knock_on_door] [Knocking_continues] Hey , dom . Thank God . I wasn't expecting you . Uh ... What is he doing here ? His stuff got stolen . But I need to crash . Where's Deb ? Dom , hi . It's been a while . Hey , congratulations . It's really exciting . Oh . Hi . Oh , I'm sorry . Did I wake you ? No . Kevin , what are you doing in . New York City ? Hey , Melissa . Um , doing some demos with a friend , the music thing . Oh . Hi . Hi . Uh , I 'd like to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I know . I ... we have to keep our phones off in class . We can't even put it on vibrator , so I forgot to put it back on . And then I went to a friend's house and fell asleep . You know , just a really rough week . Rehearsing . I'm exhausted . But I woke up . Here I am . Don't do this , Mel . I would have called to tell you I was coming , but my phone died . Uh , we're gon na head to . Betsy's . Uh , it was nice meeting you .

"@@3338333 So this is it . The end of the world . Hundreds of comets ... each the size of a small island ... each carrying the force of 1,000 nuclear warheads ... are about to come crashing ... on to the earth . We only have ourselves to blame . My name is ... Professor Neil Gant , ... I work for N.E.O . , ... NASA 'S Near Earth Object Programme . We track the debris of creation , ... the billions of comets and asteroids ... that still orbit our sun . And you'll see that America's very much in the line of fire ... Ourjob is to give advance warning of potential earth impacts . I can't sell your solution to the President and he can't sell it to the American people . I already let one disaster happen ... and now we face annihilation . I do not know how this story will end but it began a year ago , How do you do little Princess ? How do you do Mr . Kelly ? Ladies and gentlemen this is the Captain , we hope you've enjoyed yourflight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten minutes . I'm the Queen of the Beach today , all the Lords and Ladies said ... Ladies and gentlemen , the fasten your seatbelts sign is on , please remain in your seats while we await informa of a change in weather conditions . Please do not be alarmed . Ladies and gentlemen , we will shortly begin ... our descent into Shannon Airport . Please remain in your seats at all times . You need to adopt the brace position immediately in preparation for emergency landing . Abort landing , pull up , pull up ! This is it , the epicentre . You've been a participant in the biggest inter-dimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska blast in 1908 . I 'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue . Come on guys , you know the movie , who you gon na call ? Come on guys , i ? s a big movie , this is a great movie , i ? s Bill Murray . ' Lost In Translation ' ' Ghostbusters ' , i ? s , i ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourtime . Right ... ready ? Listen up . Three , two , one ... 7.17 am , June 30th 1908 . Three to five miles up directly above our heads ... there was an airburst ... here trees ... were incinerated , stripped to the bone as the blast wave , ... moved vertically downwards . Identical patterning was replicated in the 1950's . ... during atmospheric nucleartests . Are you saying the event was nuclear ? No , no , but the effects were caused by similar shockwaves . Further out trees were felled because ... the blast wave was moving closer to the horizontal when it reached them . So what happened ? This is the expert . Some people think it was an asteroid made of rock or metal . Some say it was a comet made of dust and ice . Just a couple of hours later it would have destroyed Moscow or St . Petersburg . Every living being in a 25 mile radiusjust would have been killed instantly . Yeah . In living history this , the Tunguska event , stands out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the human race ... well i ? s a real possibility . This is Gant , yeah . Hey Frank ... I ? s NASA . No we've been out in the woods for the last three days , we haven't heard of anything , why , what happened ? I need you to contact my boyfriend , I can't get through to him on his mobile . He was meant to meet me at Shannon Airport . Well ... maybe the networks are_just down , so ... No , my mobile works , so does hers . We were ten feet above the runway when the wave hit . We could have aquaplaned into Shannon . - Are you okay to report ? - Yeah . Well they evacuated the airport didn't they ? Look I , I'm sure that he , he got out in time . Really I ... I'm sorry , excuse me . No , no , I'm going , I'm gon na try and get back out there today . We'll get a camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean at speeds of over 500 miles per hour . ... slamming into coastal areas and racing inland with little or no warning . The wave heights have been reported as high as 120 feet , ... a surging mass of water engulfing an area over 3,000 square miles . Officials in Dublin have estimated the initial death toll ... at over 10,000 . The President will be issuing a full statement in the next few hours . Our initial data strongly suggests that the Tsunami was caused by a near earth object ... impacting into the Atlantic Ocean ... 300 miles off the Irish Coast . Over 30,000 people are now homeless and hundreds of thousands of people remain missing . NASAwill be launching a full enquiry into this event . We're sending out a specialist team from ... N.E.O . , our Near Earth Object Programme , to determine the source and composition of the impact object . What we're talking about here ... is either an asteroid , which is essentially a rock or metal based body , or a comet , which is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't yet know exactly where it came from . Sir , with all our satellite technology and radar telescopes , how come nobody saw this coming ? Within 24 hours we were on a plane to Ireland desperate to find the answer . We were to be met by Professor Brendan Kelly , eminent astro physicist from Queen's College . - Hi , Professor Kelly ? - Oh right , Brendan will do . - Josh Hayden . - Hi , Josh Neil Gant . Hayden and Gant eh ? You sound like a couple of outlaws . - Or lawyers . - Yeah same thing in my book . This is Tam Ly our resident Tsunami expert . Sent by the Gods . In fact by the University of Tokyo . You're not from Japan ? No , no , I'm originally from Vietnam , I did my MSC in America , Santa Cruz . Brendan's expertise was in ... the microscopic particles left overfrom the creation of our solar system . You know the thing about dust ... Yeah , dust is so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . You mean the accumulation of dust ? I know what I mean . I'm the King of Dust ! When do you think we'll be able to get down to the coast ? Ah access is restricted at the minute , we'll go to Shannon tomorrow , see if we can get authorisation . I'll put a call in , get NASAto pull some strings for us . Right , make yourself at home . We've been trying to collate some incoming evidence , seismic data , barometric readings . Lot of stuff coming in from India . You know we're gon na have to give this N.E.O . A name . Well , isn't that thejob of the Minor Planet Centre ? Oh they're down in Massachusetts , anyway we need a standby , something a little more media friendly than ... ' un - No I was thinking of ... What ? - Rockall . Rockall . I ? s the sea area the comet hit , i ? s a little Island about 250 miles north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a good idea Brendan . Here you go . Hey , where did you get these images ? American Military Reconnaissance , but we're gon na need a lot more data than this if we're gon na get a handle on Rockall's trajectory . Find out where it came from ... and why we missed it . All we had had was an approximate impact site in t what we needed was an accurate trajectory to tell us where it came from . - Anyone for curry ? - No thanks Brendan . Forget fish , curry's the thing for your brain . Project Rockall ... I ? s all in the turmeric you see . I ? s full of curcumin , which is an anti-oxidant , so now you know . Get the curry down you , ward off that mental decay . You should have some Josh . That was a flight attendant on 419 , the plan that outran the wave , well she's got the footage on her cell phone ... but she's heading back to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go . - Tha ? s ourterritory . - Yeah , yeah . Here we go . Oh we can get a time stamp on that . - And tha ? s good ? - Oh tha ? s very good . Now is there any chance we could get the flight path data ... to find out exactly where you were when you took t Yeah , sure . If we can get a fix on your exact position we can cross-reference that with the light in this ... and then i ? ll help us get a sense of the trajectory of the N.E.O . And then you can find out where it came from right ? Exactly . Have you got wireless connect on this cell phone ? Yeah you do . Great its worked . Marcie , thank you very much , you've been very helpful . So , you guys are like spacemen ? We're not trained in aeronautics but yeah we're part of NASA . Now N.E.O . Why i ? s at the heart of the space industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Matrix ' ? You are so cool ! I'm kidding . Charlie , how are you ? - Brendan ... - Any news of the family ? No , nothing , nothing yet . Come here , let me show you . - Excuse me , we're from ... - Just one second . ... we're from NASA , we , we need immediate access to the disaster zone , there's some permits here for us apparently . Anyone know anything about permits for NASA ? Be here all day . Yes . We need another airlift ASAP but ... the main supply route is blocked , so if you can't get a runway slot we'll have to do the food drop by parachute . Excuse me sir , are you from FEMA ? I ... well yeah , I'm just helping out with the International Disaster Response ... Neil Gant , with NASA . Adam right ? You care to help out a compatriot ? Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy , secured us permits within the hour , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyse the debris left by the Tsunami before ... it was disturbed by the clear up operation . To the trained eye this wreckage held vital clues to the origins of the N.E.O . That had so taken us by surprise . We'll build a map of the debris pattern , we'll learn more about the wave . And we'll start to get a handle on Rockall . Three days ago those rocks were at the bottom of the sea . You know , 1,000 years from now people will come here like this was the Irish Stonehenge , and they'll be thinking "" how did they get the rocks up there ? "" huh ? Cliff height is about 72 feet so we know ... the wave was at least that high as it hit the coast . Maybe they'll think of it as a monument to 8/8 . The wave spilled overthe cliff and scattered the debris across a vast area . The scatter pattern and the inclination of once vertical structures would ... tell us the precise strength and direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There's someone here , there's someone in here ! I've got her head . We've got ta get to a hospital . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven ... Neil , there's no pulse . Neil , i ? s too late . There's an e-mail from that air hostess , she's managed to get hold of the radar data and the exact flight co-ordinates . We need to get it into the mapping programme . - I'll do it when we get back . - Huh ? - I'll do it when we get back . - Fine . Tsunami death toll rises ... Turn it off ! ... authorities struggling to cope with the number of bodies . - Churches and schools are being used - Please . - As temporary mortuaries . - Thank you . I ? s been four days since the Tsunami hit . The roads are full of mud and dirt left behind as the sea water retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , timbers and other debris ... that the search for survivors continues . Stay here tonight . Wouldn't it be betterto head back ? I don't mind driving , - we can be in Dublin by ... - Josh , we'll stay here tonight . Go easy on him , his father lived here . I'm looking for Bryan Kelly . Daddy . We let this thing through you know , we let it through ... Neil ! No-one could have predicted this . Ourjob is to watch objects in space . If i ? s not our responsibility , whose is it ? Oh Neil , get real . There's a lot less dust than I expected , if it was an asteroid it was no more than 50 metres across . And an asteroid that small would never reach the ocean ? No . And even if it did , it would never have had enough powerto ... generate a Tsunami with such a high amplitude , I mean the wave height measurements were fartoo large for an asteroid of only 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been much largerthan 50 metres , two , three hundred and ... even if it exploded on impact there would have been relatively little dust ... Because unlike an asteroid i ? s composed mainly of ice . It would have been moving much fasterthan an asteroid too , you know , between 20 and 35 miles per second . Definitely enough muscle to cause a Tsunami . Yeah . Yeah . Le ? sjust match that with the co-ordinates of ... Marcie's sighting and the satellite images ... and le ? s see if we get ... - Here she comes . - We get the point of impact . Oh yeah , notjust that ... Now if we trace the trajectory backwards ... we should be able to find out where she came from , look the orbit is practically grazing the sun , tha ? s why we missed her . A sling-shot back to there ... just to the left Betelgeuse off Orion's shoulder , - Oh gotcha - tha ? s where she came from . From the outset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the impact of a , a near-earth object , a , an N.E.O . We've discovered that this was a small long period comet , approximately 200 metres in diameter , probably formed in the very early solar system , even before the planets existed , and now , now we know where it came from . Why wasn't the comet spotted in time ? Well there are teams of astronomers around the world whose ... sole purpose is finding and tracking N.E.O . ' s ... but sadly this particular one couldn't have been predicted by them or anyone else ... Why is that ? Well because the comet approached earth at an acute angle , very small , obscured by the glare of the sun . Like fighter pilots driving out of the sun to ... surprise an enemy , impossible to see until i ? s too late . So another one could sneak up on us at any time ? No , no . No . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bear witness to , but sounds a bit odd , but it was a privilege , a tragic one , with ... terrible consequences but a privilege nevertheless . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . The scientific global community will continue to ... monitorthe comet for years to come but ... thanks to the work of Project Rockall the foundation of that research is now in place , and with it hopefully some sense of closure forthe families of the people ... who so tragically lost their lives in this natural disaster . So that was how it started . The biggest N.E.O . Impact since Tunguska and we 'd missed it . How could we have known that 8/8 wasjust the beginning ? The worst was yet to come . - We did ourjob , Neil . - Did we ? Yes . Our remit is to find objects over one kilometre in size . Rockall was 200 metres and we weren't even looking for it . May be we should have been . We don't have those sort of resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll see you at the gate . - Neil ? Hey . - Hey . Are you heading home ? Yeah , the projec ? s all wrapped up so ... they got you working again already huh ? Yeah , the Dublin route . I ? s kinda quiet but tha ? ll change . - You look beat . - Yeah . - Do you wan na walk with me ? - Yeah . I'm just curious , what is your star sign ? Oh ... I don't . Oh okay , well what do we know ? You have a big sense of responsibility , you take everything very personally , and I would say that you are kinda cautious . I would say tha ? s about the stupidest thing I've ever heard . And I would say that you are a Scorpio . Wow ! I am impressed . So ... how about you ? Pisces . Really ? What are they like ? Oh we're warm-hearted , idealistic , sensitive ... Just the good traits huh ? Oh God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tends to be balanced out by our ideal partners , Cancer or ... Scorpio . This is me , so ... Oh ... maybe I'll see you around ? Yeah , I hope so . Hey who knows , maybe i ? s in the stars ? Ground Control to Major Tom ! Are you receiving me spaceman ? I'm sorry I got ta do this , i ? s really important . I'll see you in the morning . No , take a look . Orion is amazing tonight . Betelgeuse , i ? s as red as a berry . Betelgeuse ? I ? s a star where Rockall came from . Welcome to my world . Since 8 it seemed every astronomer//on the planet was hun all sightings found their way to my inbox . No matter how trivial I had to log them , calculate the trajectories and ... estimate potential impact dates . Expert opinion was that it would not be happen in our lifetime , but i had to be ensure that . I've got something to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Science ' has accepted it for publication next month . Oh and if you flip it overtha ? s a list of Universities ... who want us to , to deliver a key note lecture . Josh I have a backlog of a hundred unmapped N.E.O . ' s here ... any one of which could be headed our way so I real don't see how glad-handing universities makes it to the top of our To Do list . I've got Kimberly Marshall on hold . Do you want me to put herthrough ? No , no , I'll take it in my office . Read it ! I ? s your work . Unbelievable . Unbelievable . A new sighting from Australia , an N.E.O . Discovered by two astronomers Gibden and Bell . Our sentry programme calculated a rough trajectory and impact date . The date was chillingly familiar . A second sighting , the same N.E.O . And then a third . Looks like i ? s only gon na be famous from the lectures out here . Seriously the good news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ... - Hey Josh . - What N.E.O . Does ... Look at the date of approach , August 8th 2009 . What ? We're getting different observations on the same comet chain , 15 sightings so far , so put it all into SENTRY to get a date closest to approach , and what comes out ? August 8th , same date as the Irish impact . Which means that one year on , earth could be right back in the firing line again . This is comet Rockall's trajectory and ... this is what we've got so far on the new sightings potential comet chain . Now what I wan na do is get images from the Lincoln telescope and ... reports from Russia , Australia ... Fine , yeah fine . Run with the precovery . Try and keep it in perspective , this is conjecture , not fact . Hey , hey , hey ... ah ... ah ... I , I , I know we were gon na go to Vegas this weekend , I ... I got ta go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Catalina Sky Survey , Arizona . Oh ! Arizona ! Wow . Yeah , I'm really sorry , I just ... I've really got ta I ? s fine . Lets go . Oh you don't wan na come , i ? s like an eight hundred mile round trip . Well ... I tell you what , I will drive and you can pay the speeding fines . So what happens at Catalina ? Precovery . I ? s a little technical . I understood the Matrix Trilogy Neil , indulge me . - This is it ? - Yeah . This is where the guardians of the planet watch over us ? Is there a problem ? No , no , no , no . I wasjust expecting something a little , you know , cooler , a little more ' X Men ' . This is it . This is a photographic log of the constellation of Orion . - I ? s divided up into sections . - I get it . The computer stores images of the last few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet chain before today , before it really registered as a moving object . - Precovery ? - Precovery . Right ... The hard thing is telling the comet from the stars . I ? sjust one tiny speck of light amongst ... thousan but we've got one thing going for us ... stars don't move , N.E.O . ' s do . If you take pictures of exactly the same part of the sky but weeks apart then flip between them , find a startha ? s moved , it ain't a star , i ? s an N.E.O . What time is it ? Just to the left of Betelgeuse off the shoulder of Orion , exactly the same place as Rockall came from . Neil ? It was a long period comet probably ten to 12 miles in size originally , the same as Haley's comet , probably broke up around 1,000 years ago and formed a chain . Now what hit Ireland was a fragment ... that got a little bit ahead probably due to out-gassing , and what we're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back around ... in the same orbit and intersecting with us again . Tha ? s a lot of probably's . Probably . And you're talking massive error margins . Your mapping's rudimentary and there simply isn't enough data yet . Well I'm , I'm , I'm getting it , but Josh we're looking at a Torino scale 6 here . Oh , but you're using a scale tha ? s only been used for asteroids and relating it to comets . They're completely different animals , you know that . Comets are way more unpredictable , outgassing for a start . You can't talk about Torino 6 . We can not afford to get this wrong Josh , you know what happened last time . Josh , I want you to take this threat seriously , forward my report to Lampanelli and get NASA behind us on this ... Neil , Neil you keep doing this to me . What report ? You've got some half-assed daubings on my office wall , you're a mess man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false alarm , we will monitorthe situation no , yes , yes we will monitor it but what we will not do ... is go off half-cocked and ... look like a bunch of amateurs . Is that all you care about these days Josh ? How you look . You need to get some sleep , and take a shower while you're at it . In fact ... take the rest of the day off . I ? s not a suggestion . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . 65 million years ago , an asteroid or comet ... impacted the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico , creating 100 mile wide crater . The KT Extinction Event . I ? s estimated the impact of the force ... was equivalent to six million Hiroshima bombs . It created a vast dust cloud which blocked the light of the sun and prevented photosynthesis for many years . The KT Extinction Event was the death knell forthe majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Gant it could all happen again . Breaking newsjust in from the United States , a NASA scientist has reported that ... comet Rockall , which caused such devastation in Western Ireland , may have been part of a chain of comets ... which could collide with planet earth in eight months time . Switch the telly on . Professor Gant has named the comet chain Gibden-Bell ... afterthe two astronomers who first discovered it ... Reports of another possible comet impact have sparked fear in the worl ? s media . Stocks crashed in the blackest day for Wall Street in living memory ... Interest rates ... soared and Banks closed their doors ... as trading ceased across the globe . You'vejust wiped ten billion dollars off the DowJones Index , and now the panic's rippling around the rest of the world . You've embarrassed N.E.O . It looks as if we were covering it up . Weren't we ? Lampinelli called . NASAwants us both in Washington . General Harris has demanded a debrief . Who ? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that General Harris . - Hi Frank . - Morning Josh . The General's ready for you both . I hope you've said your Hail Marys . I'm not interested in the politics of who said what , when or why right now , I just want facts . Is earth in danger of being hit by another comet ? There is a potential threat , yes sir . Our calculations suggest a one percent chance ... of a collision somewhere on the earth's surface . One percent ? You put the fear on everyone on this planet for one percent ? If there was a one percent chance there was a rattlesnake in your back yard , would you let your kids go out and play hide and seek ? We're currently working on predicting the come ? s chain's ellipse , its trajectory , but tha ? s not something we can nail down in a matter of weeks . What are you saying ? The further away the comet chain , the less accurate our predictions . We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle on the comet chain's size and its structure . Okay , I'll back it . Wha ? s the situation with the Japanese and European space agencies ? We're liaising with them now . Good , and I want a report on our response options to this thing . We've got ta be ready . I'm gon na need to put a team together sir . Whatever you need . Looks like you gentlemen have your work cut out . Today NASA announced the first tracking of a cosmic probe to ... investigate Gibden-Bell , the comet chain scientists ... fear could be on a direct collision path with earth . - Hey welcome . - How are ya ? Yeah , good . Back at N.E.O . We set about refining our calculations for Gibden-Bell's trajectory . As the comet got nearer our calculations improved . It was not good news . Each time the potential comet path narrowed ... it seemed to be honing in on planet earth . Spotlight Voyager Seven , NASA report progress on the preparation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the probe could be_just days from launch . What we're trying to create here is a spread of a Tsunami envelope . If a fragment of Gibden-Bell does hit there's a high probability , it will impact in one of our major oceans . If i ? s a land impact then the dust composition will be critical . For dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . Are these the samples from the Stardust mission ? I'm just trying to see if the fragments we record from Rockall can give us an idea ... - as to the composition , go on take a look . - Oh great , thanks . If a high percentage of those particles contain sulphur ... we could be heading for another Ice Age . So deadly , yet so pretty . Oh gosh they're beautiful . - How are things with Josh ? - Yeah ... If there is an impact this is the bad boy we need to worry about . Roughly a mile in diameter he's about the size of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . If any fragment is gon na impact , it will be this one , the largest of the fragments Gibden-Bell A . Who's gon na tell the General ? As the threat of comet impact increases ... NASA announces that the launch of probe Voyager Seven is imminent . Mission focus will be the largest comet Gibden-Bell A . Anything Neil ? I've been working on the Whipple shoot issue forthe probe , the launch team is saying there's not enough space on the launch vehicle ... but I think i ? s essential if we're gon na protect the probe from comet debris . Wha ? s up with you ? Still working on those radar images from Arecibo . They'll be nothing like the probe can give us but ... worth having a back-up . Arecibo , the most powerful radio telescope on earth . Wishful thinking on Josh's part , the comet chain was still too distant for us to see anything useful . We desperately needed the probe . - D minus ten - Guys , i ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probe for launch . Now their efforts are complete , we have lift-off . Voyager Seven ascends towards the stars , its mission to conduct a thorough analysis of the comet Gibden-Bell . As the likelihood of an impact continues to rise , this essential information will confirmed or denied the possibilies to collision with earth With it go the hopes and fears of all mankind . God speed Voyager Seven . If a comet impacts in the ocean , it will create a Tsunami 20 times the size of the one that hit Ireland , and if it hits the Pacific ... well , we can say goodbye to the whole of the West Coast . The countries of Central America will be devastate as will Japan ... and i ? s no betterforthe Atlantic . We 'd lose every coastal county in New England , Virginia , the Carolinas , Georgia and Florida . The waves produced would annihilate Ireland and the British Isles and cause ... Ireland again eh ? ... and cause chaos in mainland Europe , the Caribbean , North West Africa ... we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions . What if we don't let it hit ? What if we try and deflect it ? Well your man at Imperial College thinks it can be done but ... they're still finessing the figures on the mass to thrust ratios . No I'm not talking about kinetic impact . Given the time frame , a stand-off nuclear explosions are the only viable option . This is a possible solution that ... we could present to General Harris next week . Josh the ... the implications of using thermo nuclear weapons ... I know , but it is an approach tha ? s actually got a chance of working . Give it a read . Le ? s at least try going with this . Well Josh has got a possible solution , but it could make things a whole lot worse . Can't you two broker a ceasefire or something ? You know , forthe sake of mankind ? Well the thing is Josh might be right . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you said that he was wrong . Yeah well there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wha ? s driving me nuts . Nobody's ever been in a situation like this before , i ? s all on us and if we screw up ... we could wind upjust like wiping out the whole planet . Marcie ? You 'd betterfix this Neil . Gentlemen . Professor . The comet chain Gibden-Bell . Now this is the fella which most concerns us . A one mile size fragment we're calling Gibden-Bell A . Ourforecasts now suggest a 60 percent chance of collision . Oh i ? s coming gentlemen and in four months time . Now if you look at the ellipse pattern , you'll see that America's very much in the line of fire , either via a giant Tsunami if the impact occurs in ... either ocean orthrough a direct land strike , which would devastate thousands of square miles . Now here's how we persuade it to go away . Stand off nuclear diversion . A series of nuclear devices will be launched to the comet , programmed to detonate alongside it , far enough away to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one side of the comet causing ... that side to outgas altering its trajectory , thrusting it away from the earth . What model basis did you use ? The Icarus Project developed at M.I.T . In 1967 . That was a , a hypothetical collision with earth by the asteroid 1566 Icarus . But Icarus assumed that they had 15 months for the deflection , you're saying we only have four ? NASA has been preparing a delivery system since the threat was first registered . The plan will require international co-operation , besides American launch bases , we 'd look to use sites in Europe and China . We've already received a pledge from the Russians . Well I presume our French Gowandan base would be suitable , however gentlemen I can not stress enough the time factor here . The schedule is achievable if we move quickly . Oh clearly , clearly time is of the essence ... We can not rush into a nuclear deflection strategy . Right now we have no idea of the stability of the comet , tha ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Gibden-Bell A is unstable and we try to deflect it , it could break up and the cometesimals released would be like multiple re-entry warheads , they would smash into our atmosphere at 160,000 miles an hour . Tha ? s not what the Deep Impact mission found . Comet 9P-Tempel was , well a lot tougherthan we thought . Yeah well what about Shoemaker-Levy 9 ? Jupiter's gravity ... tore it to pieces , it turns out that its structure was weakerthan fresh powder snow . The point is that each one of these N.E.O . ' s is structurally unique , tha ? s a fact . Sorry gentlemen , my colleague Neil Gant , he thinks we have time . I don't . Until we get the results of that probe we can only guess as to the come ? s composition , but one thing is for sure , deflecting a comet is an entirely different proposition than deflecting an asteroid . Icarus was designed to deflect an asteroid , which is made of metal or rock not ... a come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na throw nukes at that ? That is like playing baseball with a water melon ! Neil thank you , tha ? s enough ! Sit down . No , no , no , no . I wan na hearthis . Alright . If this is the blast radius of the comet fragment that ... caused the Tunguska event in Siberia in 1908 ... then this would be Washington DC ... today . If that comet breaks up we're gon na create thousands of projectiles of this kind of powertha could impact anywhere on this planet , London , New York , Paris , Rome ... the destruction globally of multiple impacts would be ... ten times greaterthan that of a single impact to America and ... of course there's no way to predict the impact zone , so no warning , no evacuation , no planning is possible . Just death and destruction on an unimaginable scale , If you're against deflecting the comet , what alternative strategy are you proposing ? America has to take the hit . Are you suggesting we sit back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months preparing in every detail an evacuation strategy . Ten days before impact we will know exactly where i ? s going to hit . We spend those ten days executing the plan . If i ? s gon na hit in the sea then we evacuate the coast , if i ? s gon na hit land then ... we evacuate half the country . We couldn't clear New Orleans in one week for Katrina , and you wan na play musical chairs with 100 million people ? It would take all the help of all of our allies and , probably most of our enemies too , but this is our best option . I ? s impossible . Even if we could evacuate , what about everything in the impact zone ? Cities , farms , factories . It would be economic suicide . America would be blasted back to the Stone Age . Allowing the comet to hit could create a cloud of dust and ... sulphur aerosols that would block out the rays of the sun . Food production then becomes impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more through starvation . It could be an Ice Age all over again . Brendan Kelly , Queen's University . I 'd like to add something . An impact winter is not a certainty . It depends on how much sulphurthere is in the comet , how much sulphurthere is in the impact zone . The come ? s precise mass and speed , the truth , the truth is ... we won't know ... until i ? s too late . Thank you , and if we don't know then how can we commit to such an extreme course of action ... Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen ... ... tha ? ll be all for now . - Frank ... - Sir ? ... could you stay back a moment ? - Absolutely . You knew that he would go forthe nuclear deflection ... because he gets to use all his little toys ... and he gets to play the big military hero and that is why you suggested it . - But if it works , it works . - What if it doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disagree . Not at this stage we're not , and not after I 'd laid out very clearly what that strategy would be . ... listen up . General Harris hasjust green lit the nuclear option . But , but , but he's also considering other plans . The final decision will hinge on the outcome of the probe , is that understood ? Yes sir . In the meantime , since you two are unable to agree on a single thing , I suggest you stay out of each other's way ... and find out exactly where GBA is gon na hit ... to the nearest millimetre . Adam Gregorski , sir . Post New Orleans , several people whose opinions I'm supposed to respect have told me ... you're the best man FEMA has . What I'm about to say to you is highly classified . I'm a professional . General , I assume tha ? s why you called me in . I need FEMAto work up an emergency mass evacuation strategy . It needs to exceed the remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DCPAwas tasked with ... creating a Crisis Relocation Plan ... Designed to evacuate citizens from urban centres in the event of a nuclear attack . ... Right , and if we continue to fund the programm update it with regular drills the catastrophes we faced during ... hurricanes Rita and Katrina could have been mitigated . The sad fact is we didn't and the crisis we're facing now , makes Katrina look like a walk in the park . You want me to resurrect CRP ? I need you to look at the research it was based on and ... adapt it for something different and far greater in scope . Tha ? s our starting point . Urban or rural evacuations ? Both . Multiple locations . Cities , towns , it could be north , south , east or west , it might be a concentrated geographic area , it could well be scattered over many states . Gregorski , I want you to put together a plan to move 100 million people . Rumours from Los Alamos , New Mexico suggest that ... recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston leaks suggest that ... engineers are secretary adapting rockets to deliver warheads to deflect Gibden-Bell A . Injust two days , Voyager Seven will start beaming back information ... on the precise trajectory of the comet chain , informations NASA scientists insist will be ... critical to the success of any future mission . There's a story that Eisenhower instructed that ... for every five miles of highway they built , it was mandatory that at least one mile be absolutely straight . Well , tha ? s a myth , but I did some digging around ... and what is true is that Congress considered using a flight strip programme in their Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 , and that got me thinking . Besides utilising all the military and commercial air bases on the West Coast , why should we not also use ourfreeways and ... use them as improvised landing strips ? Now this here is a map of the Utah desert . Interstate 80 ... mile after mile of straight road . Can you work this up state by state ? We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible ... and they will require several levels of adaptation , bulldozing the central reservations , removing power lines and signs . Reinforcing the ground to take the weight of small aircraft , but if we have to move people fast we can move them , and en masse . Our roads become our runways . Tha ? s the idea . Injust 12 hours , Voyager Seven will start its analysis of comet Gibden-Bell . Reports of military activity on several continents appears to confirm that ... a nuclear deflection strategy is moving into an advanced stage . Evacuation capacity index . Our 37 largest urban areas . How is the index calculated ? Traffic flow , highway capacity , accessibility to cars . The report also shows information on the transit dependent . How bad is that ? Those 20 cities will be harderto evacuate than ... New Orleans was after Katrina . Are you saying i ? s impossible ? Nothing's impossible . We'll have international help , offers are flooding in . Le ? s get it ready . The world holds its collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat that mankind has faced is revealed forthe very first time . These simple somewhat hypnotic pictures live from the probe Voyager Seven show ... the comet chain in all its terrible beauty . Only now will we learn the true nature of the threat that we all face . Entire nations have come to a standstill . Factories , offices , schools , all closed ... as people gaze in awe at the simple images that we see here . The comet chain , Gibden-Bell as it hurtles towards the earth . Pasadena ... lost transmission . Please confirm . Land impact confirmed , civil unrest breaks out . Curfew imposed from dusk til dawn , ... as America wakes up to the news . Unless scientists can stop it , comet Gibden-Bell will hit North America . The probe was destroyed before it had a chance to feed back any data , the official announcement will be made tomorrow , but I wanted you all to hear it first hand . The decision has been made to go ahead with the nuclear deflection strategy ... scheduled for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't sell your solution to the President , and he can't sell it to the American people . My responsibility is to protect the United States of America . And who's gon na protect the rest of the world when the comet splits up into a thousand pieces ? If it breaks up , and ain't we all part of the same planet ? What is wrong with you people ? It is so clearly betterto go into the terrible situation with a known risk than ... to take an alternative with an ambiguous outcome ... where the hazards are much worse for Americans and the whole world and General with all due respect if you weren't so worried about your career ... - then you could sell this to the President ... - Neil . Get him outta here . ... you could sell it to the President . - Someone get him outta here . - You could sell it to the President ... - Get him outta here ... Forget it Brendan , just forget it . This report here pertains to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... here , for instance here sir , we have an example of plans to dismantle relocate the Statue of Liberty . My recommendation is that we allocate the bulk of our resources into saving our people . Of course . Well we've also made provisions for animal preservation and transportation , cattle , sheep and swine movements will have to be assessed , that is here sir ... The President has given his go-ahead for the nuclear option . I understand . But if that should fail , God hope it doesn't , then this plan will be invaluable . This is good work . Professor Gant , isn't it ? We met in Ireland briefly at Shannon Airport , your , yourfellow compatriot ? Yeah right . What are you doing in the road there's a curfew on , they'll pick you up . Get in . This is brilliant . Thank you , thanks . It could really do this huh ? They could really pull this off . Are you sure the deflection plan will backfire ? No . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater probability that it won't , based on all the information that we have and ... especially everything that we don't have . I am 100 percent convinced that the deflection strategy is the wrong way to go . The outcome of this is still in your hands Neil . You'vejust got ta persuade General Harris to go against every military bone in his body . Oh is that all ? Yes tha ? s all . Listen , you'vejust got ta come up with something , you've got ta give him something , I don't know what , some intel , pictures , reports , just somethin Arecibo . Wha ? s that ? Oh Neil , I'm such an idiot . Arecibo i ? s an observatory in Puerto Rico , Josh was trying to get images up before , there's still a chance they might have some radar images , can you drive me somewhere please ? World leaders meet to discuss the impending comet threat . The President is expected to make an official statement at six pm tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option . Around the world people of all faiths gather in prayer and ... contemplation as the earth awaits its destiny . Oh the return of the native ! Where have you been , we've been worried . Have you seen Josh ? Yeah he's playing pool , i ? s not a pretty sight . We're gon na convince General Harris to change his mind . Well this might come in handy , sulphur results from Rockall , the levels are practically zero . If the comet hits us there's no chance for nuclear winter , the earth would survive . Fantastic Brendan , we've got something pretty great here too . Hey ... I wan na apologise to you , to all of you , my behaviour was totally unacceptable , I'm sorry I never intended to make anybody look bad . You made us all look bad . - Did you see Brendan's report ? - I did . - What do you think ? - I ? s not enough on its own . Oh Josh please , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to absorb the kind of energy tha ? s gon na be required to make a deflection work . I think you know that Josh ... because if we fire those missiles up there i ? sjust gon na explode ... and the fall out ... the fall outs gon na kill all of us . Do you remember Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy who fixed us up in Ireland ? General Harris asked for him to develop an evacuation strategy . The Joint Chiefs were seriously considering it actually . I've seen the plan , Adam thinks that he can pull it off , I do too . So ... if we let the comet hit yeah i ? s gon na be a major catastrophe , but we can manage it , we can plan for it , we can save lives . If it breaks up ... I ? s not going to break up . Think about what we saw in Ireland . The people , the places . That was one Tsunami . We risk creating multiples with this strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I've got everything I need right here but unfortunately I can't do it without you , so ... the Arecibo Conservatory came through , you were right about having a back-up . Look at it man , look at it , i ? s smooth which suggeststhat i ? s fragile . Yes , well smooth does imply i ? s more likely to break apart . Right . - But hardly definitive . - Oh come on Josh ! I ? s Occam's razor , Josh . All things being equal , the simplest solution is the right one , and there's nothing much more simple than this . We can't fight nature . We've got ta live with it . General , this report is based on the latest intelligence we have . It clearly backs up our worst case scenarios for the nuclear deflection plan . Our worse case scenarios ? You convinced me to go with that plan , you championed it , you're its chief architect . This is true but there's new evidence now . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be allowed to land unimpeded . Why have you changed your mind ? This latest intelligence report and ... the input and ... intuition of one of the finest scientific minds in the world . General , NASA is now 100 percent behind the evacuation option . The radar images from the Arecibo observatory have now been ... backed up by new images from the Goldstone solar system radar in California . Now , we believe that togetherthey present sufficient evidence to suggest that ... nuclear deflection runs too great a risk of fracturing the comet . You 'd see America exposed ? Our infrastructure decimated ? Our way of life immeasurably altered ? The alternative is a world in a kind of chaos that it will not survive . America will survive sir , I believe that . These men are my specialists . General , I trust them absolutely . Sir , is it true you were awarded the Medal of Honour in Vietnam ? Yes . Have you heard the story of one of yourfellow Medal winners , Marine Private Jack Lee Lucas ? The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 . Private Lucas was with three other men crawling through a ravine ... when the Japanese launched a hand grenade attack . He threw himself on two of the grenades to save his companions , the blast blew him into the air , ripped chunks out of his chest , but he survived . Lucas didn't ask to be a hero , he took the shrapnel from those grenades because ... it was the only thing to do . America needs to step up and take that hit because ... because it can . Tha ? s a very nice story Professor , but like you . I preferto make my decisions based on the evidence before me . Gentlemen . Leave me to think this through . Tonight the North East of America is on the move . Instead of the widely expected strategy of nuclear deflection , the President unveiled a comprehensive Federal Evacuation Plan , now 15 US and two Canadian States are being relocated . The authorities have_just four weeks to safely evacuate 100 million people . Tonight the mass exodus of Washington starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities all across the Eastern States , as people living east of the line of separation flee their homes in their millions . International support has been described as "" overwhelming "" . Ships , aircraft and essential supplies are being ... directed to the evacuation zone from around the world . Navies from Russia , India , Great Britain and France are ... assisting with the evacuation of the eastern sea port . The plan has been hailed as comprehensive in its application , ... encompassing all aspects of historical and contemporary existence . On Liberty Island the rescue programme is underway for New York's most famous cultural landmark . Where should we draw the line ? From muzeums to zoos , tha ? s the question facing officials as the hours tick by . Sir , they're suggesting that we re-commission the bunkerfacility ... in the Greenbriar Hotel in West Virginia . Forget about Greenbriar , strike it off the list . Even though they survive the impact ... they'll be crawling into a burning desert , i ? s no good . Elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save ? Er ... you know , aside from human beings , the elephant is the only other land animal that actually sheds tears . Tha ? s very touching Leon but i ? s not true . Many animals produce tears to lubricate the eye , it does not imply emotion . But apart from us the elephants are the only one's that seem to grieve ... when they lose a family member , when an elephant walks past the spot where they lost a loved one ... theyjust stop still . They mourn their dead . Across the impact zone ... airports , military and private airfields are working around the clock to maximise the evacuation . In the rest of the world flights have ground ... to a halt as national airlines donate theirfle Military aircraft and cargo carriers are being adapted to ferry evacuees at unprecedented rates . More planes are being put in the air in one hour than are normally undertaken in an entire day . I've been told that even crop sprayers are being utilised to help airlift people out ... of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large international airports such Dulles that ... the true scale of the evacuation can be seen . Freeways , highways , just about anywhere an aircraft can land has been requisitioned by FEMAto accelerate the exodus . Skies above major Southern State cities are filled with planes . Volunteer air crews , emergency and military personnel will be those at the front line , risking themselves to the very end to ensure that as many people as possible get out alive . - Josh ! Any sign of Marcie's transport ? - Not yet . I don't want you to do this , I want you to be so efficient , just get on that flight and never look back . Nobody forced me , I volunteered remember ? Well don't take too many trips and , I mean don't leave it too long to get yourflight out of there okay ? I ? s here ! This is it . I ? s ... not for Marcie , i ? s for us . Sorry . Marcie , I ... I know . You've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Be safe . I will . Five days before comet impact and civil unrest spreads throughout the impact zone . Despite the massive numbers successfully transported to safety , panic is spreading amongst those for whom time is running out . Josh ! Josh we got it , we've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania , i ? s Pennsylvania . - You sure ? - Yeah , i ? s Pennsylvania . Okay . Yeah , can I speak to General Harris please ? Urgently . Hi , i ? s Josh Hayden here , we've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania . The State of Pennsylvania has been identified , ... as the likely epicentre of the comet impact . Prioritised now for evacuation resources are being swiftly ... directed towards the State and the surrounding areas . Exact impact possibilities now ... include the Pennsylvanian cities of Harrisburgh , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Johnstown , or Altoona . I wan na thank you for all the hard work your people put in . We're not gon na have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five percent of the population of the Eastern States being left behind . We can only do wha ? s in our powerto do , and you've done what you can Adam . Well not yet , I'm co-ordinating the final stages for Virginia from Dulles airport . Good luck . When do you leave sir ? I'll be turning out the lights . Last man standing sir ? The Federal Authorities today claimed a 90 percent rate of successful evacuation of the impact States Cities across North East America stand empty afterthe mass re-location of some 90 million people . With less than 48 hours to go those remaining in the impact zone are urged to ... make their way to the congregation points at ports and airfields to ensure their safe evacuation . We have 15 minutes to turn this aircraft around . Quickly as you can please . Fill in from the back ... and sit down as soon as you're inside . Wait , don't close the door . Don't close that . I , I was with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he's gone . Well if he's not on this flight sir he'll be ... I have to find him , I'm getting off . Look this is your last ticket out of here , you miss this you won't get out alive , now get back to your seat ... now ... sir . Ladies and gentlemen , for everybody left standing , there are straps and rails provided , please hold on to them with both hands very tightly . I can get three more planes back in the sky in an hour , but we've lost half ourfuelling crew , I need more men . You carry on loading , I'll worry about the crew , you're doing a goodjob , keep it going . Sir ... you may need this . I ? s starting to spiral . Guys ... i ? s Pittsburgh . So Pittsburgh will take the full force of Gibden-Bell A . In the first few seconds after impact a ... 25 mile wide fireball will vaporise everything in its path . The shock wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered buildings and bones in its wake . As far as Chicago , Washington , Toronto and New York , the shock wave will hit these cities at 600 miles per hour and ... will be followed by a force nine earthquake . God help anyone left behind . I wan na thank you for your bravery and patience . Now we're looking at the last few calls , sections one and two will leave on the first transport , likewise Frank there's nothing more for your people to do here , you're all on the next chopper . If you say so sir . Le ? s go team . I 'd like to stay please . This is the best place to keep tabs on things and ... I just wan na make sure that my calculations are absolutely correct . A little late in the day for_that . Yeah I know but ... can we please stay ? Very well . You'll be on the last transport with me . I 'd like to stay as well . We're witnessing history in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rivertwice . Guess I'm in too . And me . No , not you . I won't have it . Is that fair ? I wan na stay . When was anything everfair ? If things go wrong here we're gon na need scientists on the West Coast and ... you're so much smarterthan us . Hey . One day to impact and with time running out , special rescue teams are targeting those unable to get to designated assembly points . All able-bodied people are urged to get to an evacuation centre as soon as possible . We're in the final stages of the evacuation here at Dulles , and the last flights are now leaving . With three hours left to go before impact , ... it is finally time to say goodbye to our Nation's Capital . I ? s weird but I feel ... kinda relieved now , you know . You're relieved ? Finally you're relieved ! Morning death , we've been expecting you . What is that ? Is that , is that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Is that yours ? Yeah ! Do you like it ? You know what , e-mail it to someone just in case ... we don't make it outta here . Jeez you noisy monkeys , what time is it ? This is it then eh ? The helicopter's on its way , time to go gentlemen , that includes you son . 26,000 men and women worked within these walls , tomorrow there'll be nothing but dust . we_just lost the chopper . Lost contact ? Sir , it , it_just disappeared , I have no idea what happened . Have you tried to raise Bravo Six ? They're out of range . We're trapped here aren't we ? Adam Gregorski's at Dulles airport , civilian evac . Change of plan , we're going by road . Authorities have advised that there will be no more flights leaving forthe impact zone . Flights out will continue for_just one more hour . Marcie , hey , hey where are you ? We'rejust coming into Dulles airport now , but where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Well how far are you ? We're close , how long can you hold it for ? Marcie ? Marcie ? Marcie ? You need to re-direct those people at Dulles , and it has to be done in stages , do you understand ? - We're swamped here already . - Yes , sir . But i can't . You get them on the transports , have the men escort them in groups of 300 , stagger it every half hour , you can do this Leon . Please be advised that we are re-directing all inbound planes , there will be no further landings . Prepare final craft fortake off . Quickly as possible folks , if you couldjust ... move on , move along , quickly as possible . Fill the seats up as soon as you're inside , forthose of you left standing , there are rails and straps fitted , please hold on as tightly as possible . Dead end . Alright Sergeant , ten more , go ! Come on , straight up , straight up . Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way ... - Don't shoot ... - We're getting on , let me through . - Don't shoot , don't shoot . - We're getting on . - Sir , you've got your daughter with you ... Get back ! Do not do this with your daughter ... - Stand back ! - Do not do this sir , now I need you to help me sir , I promise you , you'll make it out ... I said get back ! I know you're scared , we're all scared ... but if we work together we can make this through . Now I promise you , you and your daughter will be on a plane out of here ... but you've got ta help me . Please ... give me the gun . At least save my daughter ! - Close up the plane . - Yes sir . I need ... two more minutes please . I'm sorry Marcie , we can't wait any longer . Preparing to taxi , hold tight ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s still here . Everybody's going . We're too late . Get out of the way ! I've got ta find Marcie . Stay where you are , don't move ! Don't move . Hold your weapon soldier , there's a FEMA officer in charge here , take us to him . Come on , le ? s go , come on . - Yes sir . - Le ? s go . Marcie , Marcie ? Hey , hey , where are you ? We're on the runway , where are you ? We're on the plane at the far side of the runway . She's on that one , le ? s go . Get him outta here , Get him outta here . Hold the crowd back , hold them back . Are you alright mate ? Come on ... What you doing ? I've got ta go back , I've got ta go back , I've got ta go back , get on the plane ... - Marcie we're here , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you in . Rear door unsecured , what the hell's going on back there ? We've to leave right now . Come on , don't restrain me , get on the plane . Go ... Hold ' em back ... come on hold ' em back . Gim me that gun . Josh , come on ! Secure the rear door . We gon na leave right now . When the impact was exhausted the North American landscape would be changed forever . A scorched , broken wasteland . No-one yet knows how many died . Five million , maybe more ... but in this moment we have survived . In this moment we have come through the worst . The world will keep on turning ... and mankind will find a way . This time .

Best wife a chap ever had . You know , we never had a cross word . The things she turned a blind eye to . Not even a black look . Not a dickie bird . One in a million . Fancy another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drinking man . Not really . - I 'd better be off . - Fair enough , fair enough . A large one in there , my dear . Oh . So you're off , then , are you ? It's my wife's funeral Thursday . 11 o'clock , St Thomas's , Priory Road , if you 'd care to come . I don't quite see the point of that . Oh , right . A quid pro quo . Oh , fair enough , I suppose . I'll be off , then . - One day at a time , eh ? - Anything you say , old chap . Ah , that's more like it . What about you , my dear ? Could you handle a large one ? # Like lightning and thunder # Da-da-da-dah ... # Lightning and thunder ... # Black as the Aga Khan's back passage . Mary ! # Bring back , bring back # Bring back my bonnie to me ... Reggie ! Reggie ! Reggie , over here ! Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Reggie ? - A bit of special ops . - Enough said . - Are we talking Jerry or Popsy ? - That little nurse , am I right ? - Possibly .

All mouth and trousers . I could tell how he was feeling , though . Same as me . I'll be all right , just you watch . You'll be proud of me . For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our sister Grace Southgate , we therefore commit her body to the ground . Earth to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ . Hello . Mr Southgate ? I'm Mandy Hulme from Social Services . - Did you get my letter ? - You said ten o'clock . Yes , I'm sorry , I'm a bit early . - Shall I come back later ? - No , it's all right . - Since you're here . - OK . Thank you . Just doing a spot of housework . So I see . Oh , Mr Southgate . That's beautiful . Oh , yes . That big one was taken on VE Day . She paid a street photographer half a crown to get that picture taken for me . - She looks very happy . - She was . - Cup of tea ? - Yes , please . If it's no trouble . I've no need to ask if you're coping . Some of my clients find it very hard . You 'd think they 'd never set foot in the kitchen . We always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everything . So you can cross me off your list . Were any of your family able to attend the funeral ? No . Our daughter Vera's in Australia . She would have come , but I told her she needn't , so she didn't . And your son ? No . There was a lot of people there , what with me being on the milk and Grace doing school dinners . But er ... I wouldn't say we had many friends . Not close friends . ' Roy . ' ' Roy . ' ' What ? ' How many times do you think we've done it now ? You tell me . 417 . Smashed the three-legged race record ! Roy ! Can you feel it ? Yeah . It's little Alan . Or Vera . Did you know you can get lunch at the community centre ? It's only 75 pence , and it's quite good . Did you know that at The Feathers , you can get a damn good lunch for ? 7.50 with wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you're saying I don't need to worry about you ? Exactly . - Well , I would still like to see you again . - Delighted to hear it . So , say ... erm , two weeks from today at about the same time ? Mmm ... I've got a better idea . What say I er ... take you to dinner tonight ? That's against regulations , I'm afraid , but thank you for asking . It's very kind of you . So ... two weeks from today . Right , fair enough . So , how was it , then ? - The funeral . - Much you care . You 'd have come if you 'd had any consideration . Don't tell me you couldn't have got a pass . I know you could have . It's not as simple as that , Dad . And well you know it . - She would've wanted you there . - She wouldn't . She was ashamed of me . Same as you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were her son , and she loved you till the day she died . Yeah . You think that if it makes you happy . I can't taste these . You always get it wrong , don't you ? - I don't know why you bother coming . - Nor do I . No ... I'm sorry , Son , I didn't mean that . You know I'll always be here for you . May your balls wither and drop like rotten figs , my friend . Morning . Beneficiaries aren't normally together for the reading of the will , but Mrs Conyngham-Jervis agreed with me that it might be the best course . The value of the stocks and shares on the 2nd of June amounted to ... some ? 721,043 . Good God . In addition , some unit trust funds amounted to ? 141,000-odd . And Mrs Conyngham-Jervis owned the house , currently valued at ? 700,000 . That's a million and a half . You sure ? Quite sure , Squadron Leader . Now , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! "" I desire that my husband , if I should pre-decease him , "" be permitted to live in our home , The Cedars , Neville Park , "" but that after his death , it be sold , "" the proceeds going to the British Association for Adoption and Fostering , "" to aid those who are childless . "" I bequeath to my husband , Reginald Vivian Conyngham-Jervis , "" ? 10,000 a year . "" The remainder of my property I leave to my nieces , Celia and Felicity , "" to be divided between them in equal shares and held in trust until they marry "" or they have attained the age of 30 , whichever is the sooner . "" Roughly speaking , that means 400,000 for each of you , after payment of estate duty . Your wife asked me to hand you this letter if she died before you . Thank you . Fine . ' Darling Reggie . ' I hope all this didn't come as too much of a shock . ' I hope you won't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see what I mean . ' As for Felicity and Celia , they're dear girls ' and they had a rough time when their father remarried . ' I don't think Susan really cares for them much . ' I wanted them to have independence . So don't be too cross , Reggie . ' I think I've left enough for you not to have to pull your horns in too much . ' But after what happened ... ' No ! ' I know I haven't been a very exciting wife . ' But I have loved you . ' I wish I 'd been able to say it more often . ' Marriage is a funny thing , isn't it ? It isn't easy . ' Lt's not what you expect it's going to be . ' We've had a rather English marriage , I think . ' Mr Southgate and Squadron Leader Conyngham-Jervis . Now , I've had a rather wild idea . I'll show you what will be your quarters . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big room , just for one . Is it ? Oh , I suppose some people might think so . Er , wardrobe , chest , usual gubbins , your own bathroom next door . When you think of the places we slept in during the war . Absolutely . - Who were you with ? - Pioneer Corps . Went over on D-Day , right through to the end . Jolly useful job you chaps did too . Great days . Best years of your life bar none . Always wondered who they were , these blokes who really enjoyed their war . Oh , well , now you've met one . Yeah . Jolly good . Right , er ... shall we go downstairs and have a bit of a confab ? Sure you won't ? Bit early for me , thanks . Very wise , I'm sure . Now , er , look here , Southgate , this notion the little popsy from the social services dreamt up looked a bit strange at first blush , but there might be something in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could do with help on the domestic side , cooking and that , and we could both do with a bit of company . What I was thinking of was more the practical arrangements . I've been eating at the local , mostly , Feathers . Getting a bit sick of it . I'm not much of a cook . I left all that to Mary . I gather from that popsy you're rather a whizz in that department . There's not much I can't do . I'm more inclined to traditional stuff , roasts and three veg , steak and kidney pie , steamed puds . And I suppose , on your side , what you get is the free accommodation . - I've got a house of me own . - Yes , yes . But er ... heating , etcetera , your own rooms , run of the house , garden . Er , you drive ? - Anything and everything . - Including milk floats , I gather . Well , you could use the old motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have the use of the car yourself when I don't need it . Really ? Thanks . Very kind of you . What do you say ? Give it a whirl , shall we ? All right . Yeah . Oh , yeah , there is one thing . What do we call each other ? Good point . I suppose I call you Southgate , you call me Squadron Leader . How 'd that be ? Are you sure you wouldn't prefer sir ? Well ... it's a bit formal , don't you think ? Move your stuff round at the weekend and I'll run you round in the Elvis . Can't say fairer than that , what ? OK . You're on . Jolly good . He's a weird old stick . If you don't like it , we don't have to stay . We'll be popping back weekends , make sure everything's all right at home . # Pennsylvania six-five-thousand ! - Need any help ? - Er , if you could lay the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Excellent , Southgate . Mmm . - Well done . - Not bad , was it ? Not bad at all . Now , er , look here . Er , I thought I might go down to the pub for a couple or three . I don't suppose you 'd care to er ... No , you're not much of a drinking man . Oh , well . Jolly good . Jolly good start . I might be rather late back , so you go up when you're ready . Don't wait up . Got me key , right ? Er , and I'm to clear the supper things and wash up , am I ? Well , all in your own good time . No urgency . Er ... damn fine dinner that , Southgate . Appreciate it very much . Cheerio ! Let's face it , in a dogfight , the tighter you turn , the more chance you've got . My God , the Spitfire had one hell of a tight turn . Just flipped over like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that's it , isn't it ? - What ? - Know-how . Yes , damn right . Another one in there . You see , the way I see it , Squadron Leader , you take your life in your hands every time you step on a plane . That's not so , Jimbo , not if you know what you're doing . Take the Messerschmitt , for instance . - Fine aircraft ... - What a day ! Stocktaking , what a nightmare . Scotch and sympathy required . Allow me . A Glenmorangie for the lady . Make it a large one . Well , I don't know you , but the way I feel , that 'd be a lifesaver . That 'd be lovely , thanks . - Smoke ? - Oh , dear , I don't know . Well , yeah , go on . Lead me astray . Oh , I'm Elizabeth Franks , by the way . Everyone calls me Liz . I'm er ... Reginald Conyngham-Jervis . Everyone calls me Reggie . Cheers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No . No . Lucky man . I shouldn't say that - mine are darlings . - But one never stops worrying . - Prep school , are they ? That's very gallant of you , Reggie . They're a bit older . Hugo's doing that round-the-world thing . - And Alicia did a bit of modelling . - Takes after her mother , then . Thank you , kind sir . And now she's trying out catering . One just wishes they 'd settle down and get on with their lives . Absolutely . For me , it was straight out of the RAF into the family firm . Still active there . The chairman's my nephew , Lord Blyth-Gowry . I still think of him as young Vivian . Could still do with a steadying hand . Yes , and I bet you're just the man . Might I ask what the family firm is ? Conyngham-Jervis , London , Hong Kong , big trading company . - I believe we started in opium . - Ooh ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . And you ? Oh , very small beer compared to that . I've a boutique in the Pantiles . Designer labels for the discerning woman . And though I say it as shouldn't , I do think I'm a bit special . I'll drink to that . You're so sweet . I don't believe you're real . I'm real enough . Large as life , twice as ugly . I wouldn't say that either . Tell me , Southgate . What do you do for women ? Nothing now . Hell of a problem , right ? Not for me . I never really wanted anyone but Grace . That so ? Right from the off . We was both a bit shy to begin with . Took us a while to get the hang of it . - After that ... - I know what you mean . Nothing to beat it , eh ? Every night of our married life . - Really ? - More than that when we was younger . You're right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more her I miss . I can't imagine doing it with anyone else . I expect you feel the same . Not really , no . Oh , there's more in you than meets the eye , Sonny Jim ! By the way , don't forget , I've got the car tomorrow . - I'm gon na see me son . - Yep , fine . - Are you sure ? - I said so , didn't I ? So , erm , you're a beggar and no mistake . I 'd heard of chaps who stuck to one woman all their lives but never met one . Strange world . I mean , I've had more women than I can remember , you've had just the one . But if what you say is true , then you must have had a heck of a lot more jumps than I have . - So who's the winner , eh ? - Didn't think it was a competition . You are a prissy little tight-arsed bastard , aren't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Hello ? - Is that still the number for Sabrina ? ' I'll just see if she's free , sir . - ' Who should I say it is ? ' - Er ... Tell her it's the Squadron Leader . Reggie . It's been a while , but she'll remember . I'm sure she will , sir . - I remember you very well . - Ah . Lovely to hear from you again . Just hold on a second , Squadron Leader . Squadron Leader Reggie . Oh , yes . Hang on . - Just hold on , sir . Thank you . - Mm , mm . Yes . Here he is . Posh old geezer . Straight sex . Got it up last time and he calls it the Big Bad Boy . Sweeeeet . Here she is , sir . Reggie , darling ! I thought you 'd forgotten all about me . So how's that Big Bad Boy of yours ? A bit out of practice , since you mention it . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - So ... when can you come ? - Wednesday . Day after tomorrow ? - Wednesday ? - Mm-mm . Er ... I've got a cancellation tomorrow , at three . Er , right . I'll see you then . Ah , Southgate . Look here , about tomorrow . - Yeah . I've got to leave early . - Well , that's just it . All off . Operation scrubbed . Need the car meself . Going to London . You can't do that , Squadron Leader . You promised . I've made the arrangements . You'll just have to unmake them . I need the car , you see . - Tell him you'll make it the week after . - No , that's no good . Alan's expecting me . I can't let him down . - I've got to have that car . - There's no "" got to "" about it . It's my car . I said you could have it when I didn't need it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuits ? You promised me , I asked you if it was definite and you said yeah . Now you're trying to go back on it . Where I come from , a gentleman is somebody who keeps his word . You think I'm just an unpaid servant . You think you can treat me any way you like . Either I have that car tomorrow or that's it , I'm packing me bags . Make your mind up . Oomph . God , man , keep your hair on . You can have the ruddy car if it means so much to you . I'll go up by train . Suit me better , as a matter of fact . London's a bit of a nightmare these days . Good . Well , that's settled , then . Who's won the pools , then ? So you get to drive his Elvis , and what does he get ? Well , he's like a lot of these Neville Park types . He's got no idea how to look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . It works out . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . What's wrong with that ? And he gives the orders and you take ' em ? Mum's dead and you don't feel right unless someone's bossing you about . It isn't like that at all , Alan . So what's he like in bed , then ? - ' Yes ? ' - Squadron Leader . ' Up you come . ' Oh , Reggie , darling ! What a man ! - There you are , sir . - Thank you . Here you are . That's all right . Thank you . Southgate ! Southgate , are you home ? All present and correct . Supper's sausages and mash . Cup of tea ? Bugger tea . Let's have a pink gin . Get that apron off . Jolly good , jolly good . Good day out ? Not bad . Car went like a bird . Thanks for letting me have it . Any time , old chap , any time . Just say the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man being as old as he feels ? Yeah ? Well , I'm here to tell you - they are bloody well right ! Here . - Glad to hear it . - Cheers . - Cheers . I've had such a lovely time , Reggie . How about a nightcap , back at my place ? You haven't seen it . It's just round the corner . That's sweet of you , but I've got my car here . - You're very sweet too , Liz . - Bless you . - You know I 'd love to ... - It means a lot to me . Meeting you has been the best thing to happen to me since God knows when . Say yes . Say you'll say yes . All right . But only on condition that we go there in my car . Absolutely . Jolly good idea . Chocks away ! Chocks away , Squadron Leader ! Lovely house . Yes . Over the porch it says 1899 . So what do you say ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really should be going . It's long past midnight . You're a lovely girl . - Oh , Reggie . - Liz . You're so exciting . Oh ... Reggie ... Don't , I ... I never meant ... I want to make love to you more than anything in the world . Oh , Reggie , I don't know . It's much too soon . We hardly know each other . I think we do , you know . Oh , dear . Kiss me again . - What was that ? - Oh , no one . What do you mean ? It can't be no one . - You told me you lived alone . - I do . It's Southgate . - Who's Southgate ? - Just a man . Just a servant . My m-manservant . Manservant ? Don't worry . Come on , darling . Let's go upstairs . No , it doesn't feel right , not with someone else here . - Come on ! - No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - You can't leave me like this . - No , let me go ! It is late and I've got an early start tomorrow . It's been a lovely evening , Reggie . Thank you . You'll phone me soon , won't you ? Promise . Southgate ! I suppose you realise you've ruined my whole fucking evening . Home and dry , and you've got to cock it up with your weak bladder ! You're about as much bloody use as a fart in a bottle ! Good night ! No , I realise it wasn't your fault . Bloody woman just panicked . Strange creatures , women . Like bloody antelopes . One wrong sound and they panic . - Want another ? - I don't mind if I do . You're getting the hang of whisky drinking . It's your birthday . I never thought I 'd be spending it like this . Still . Good dinner , good whisky ... Who needs women ? Ever been to Scotland , Southgate ? Matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . When I was a boy , we 'd spend a month up there every year . - Just like royalty . - Just like royalty . They go to Balmoral , we went to Roxburghshire . - Blairgowrie Castle . - You had a castle ? Course we had a castle . Not any more . Bloody Vivian , Lord Blyth-Gowry , "" can't justify the expense "" . Bloody toerag . Ahh ... We had the best of times , Southgate . Just once a year , we had this bloody great party . Everyone was equal , all pissed as rats , all the family , guests , keepers , kitchen maids - and there were one or two of them , I tell you ! Mmm . And now I've got to make do with you . And vice versa . Mm . So ... we keep our peckers up . We're not dismayed . I know what we need . A bit of music . Let's see what we've got over here , shall we ? Heh ! Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mmm . I think you'll remember this one , Southgate . # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself # Alone ... # Ah ! Excellent . Southgate , on your feet . What for ? Don't argue the toss with me . Come on , get up . Come on , turn round , now . Put your arms there . No , no . There . # Leave all your lovers # Weepin ' on a faraway shore # Out on the briny # With the moon big and shiny # Melting your heart of stone # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself , alone # Thank you , Southgate . God bless you , sir . Happy birthday . Italy ? Why didn't you say before ? - Who are you going with ? - Just friends , Reggie . I'm not giving you the run-around . It's partly a buying trip for the shop . I'll give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll see you when I see you , then . - What is it ? - Just checking it's OK to have the car . - I said so , didn't I ? - Well , have you got the keys ? Oh . Oh . Erm ... - Take it . There you are . - Thank you . No ! Got a letter from June to say she's found another bloke . And , "" I hope one day I'll be able to forgive you for what you did to me . "" Silly cow . It was nothing to do with her , nothing . And she never really cared . It was never a proper marriage , just going through the motions . So to speak . She was terribly upset , Alan . We all were . She thought I had a girl on the side . Got the shock of her life when she found out . Well , you could say we all did . - Broke your mother's heart . - Bollocks . It was just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for her . Vera went to Australia to escape . I'm not listening . You never did listen . Always took her side . You don't get it . You made me like this . You wan na know why ? Because you and her made me feel like nothing . You disgust me . I know . I always did . Squadron Leader , I'm home ! On the terrace . Hot enough for you ? Time flies , eh ? Sorry I'm a bit late . I'll get the supper on . Oh , bugger that . I don't want your long-suffering act . Come on , man . Sit down , have a drink , enjoy life . Dinner can wait a bit . All right , I'll have a small one . Oh , he'll have a small one . Splendid . We 'd drop dead of astonishment if you asked for a large one . Cheers . What sort of day did you have ? I wouldn't say pleasant . He's in jug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say that ? - Just guessed . - Come on , am I right ? - Yeah , you're right . It's all right , man . Not your fault . Can't be responsible for him all of your life . What did he do ? No need to say if you don't want to . - I 'd rather not , if you don't mind . - Fair enough . These things happen in the best of families , you know . Nothing to be done about it . Just get on with it . That's it . I can't see where we went wrong with him . All we wanted was for him to be happy . Of course you did . It's just one of those things . It's a damn shame . But you're not to blame . Bad show , end of story . It isn't as if we didn't set him a good example , his mum and me . We was always happily married . We had a wonderful marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . Hmph . I don't think anybody ever said that about me and Mary . I don't think I 'd have liked it if they had . We rubbed along all right . I had a few flings . Nothing serious . She always forgave me . If she found out , that is . Never talked much . Didn't see the need for it . - Miss her , though . - Yeah . Yeah . But , you know , it does get a bit easier , as time passes . Never thought it would , but it does . She was very fond of dogs . We used to have two of them . Labs . They were called Huntley and Palmer . Dead now , of course . Years ago . Hmph ! She loved those dogs . Hm . Brrr ! Getting a bit chilly . - Bit of supper ? - Oh ... Dinner , Southgate , dinner . Absolutely useless . Talk to your bloody self . Come on ! Chic To Chic . Buongiorno . Could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie , darling ! - Why didn't you tell me you were back ? - I was just about to when you phoned . - I had a million things to do . - More important than me ? Oh , darling , please don't be like that . Who was that chap ? In your shop . Er ... I happened to be passing . Tuesday . He was kissing you . Oh ! Darling , that was Colin . He's got the art gallery across the way . He's a mate . And he's gay . - He's a poofter ? - Yes . Oh . Then there isn't anyone else ? No , there isn't anybody else . If there were someone else , if you were giving me the run-around , I don't think I could bear that . Yes , I know . It's all right , Reggie , but you have to understand that I am a woman . I had grasped that . And I need to be quite sure of my feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Good Lord , no . Not for the world . This chap's looking a bit peaky . Waiter ! What you said , I quite understand . Absolutely . But er ... on the other hand , I'm a man . Can't hold out for ever . Yes ! - ' Can I speak to Mr S ... ' - What ? - ' Mr Southgate . ' - Southgate ? What the hell are you bothering me for ? Oh , all right , don't tell me . Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone ! Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone for you . Take it downstairs and tell them not to phone you here again . Speaking . Yeah . Er ... Er ... Yeah , yeah , I-I-I'll do that . Yeah , right away . Yeah . Er ... thanks for letting me know . Who the hell was that ? Bloody outrageous . Er , it was the prison . My son's dead . Is it all right if I take the car ? Good God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course you can take the car , old chap . A bloody awful thing . I'll just er ... I'll just get out of your way . We are extremely sorry about this , Mr Southgate . It wasn't simply a cry for help . He clearly wanted to end his own life . There's always the possibility in these circumstances as the release date looms . But your son had no anxiety that we could detect about going back into society . And he had people who cared about him . Not many fathers would have stood by their sons as you have , Mr Southgate . - I want him to have a proper funeral . - Of course . And could I just say again how sorry we are , Mr Southgate ? Yeah , I know . It wasn't your fault . He's at peace now , Grace . That's the way we've got to look at it . We did our best for him . 32 separate offences . And all with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 14-year-old boy . He 'd never admit there was anything wrong in it . Of course , they put a restraining order on him . He said , "" If I can't see Gerry again , "" I don't want to live . "" What makes somebody go wrong like that ? Was it my fault ? I was always hard on him , you know . Strict . Maybe we both expected too much of him . Absolute bloody rubbish . People make their own bloody messes . It's not as if you beat him black and blue . All you can do is tell them what's right as you see it . The rest is up to them . You loved that boy of yours . Any fool can see that . Not your fault . Nothing to reproach yourself with . Nothing at all . No ! Are you suggesting I should sell up to become a shop assistant ? Wouldn't be that different from what you're doing now . And you'll be taking home regular money every week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to swallow our pride sometimes . - How old are you , Mr Whittington ? - 32 . I can't help it . I have to work to strict guidelines . The bank will extend your business loan for another 30 days . After that , either we see reducing payments , or we'll call in the loan . I'll confirm this in writing . Yes , what ? Reggie , darling , it's Liz . Liz ! How are you ? Long time no see . Whose fault was that ? I've been waiting by the phone . Well , I thought I 'd give you a bit of space . Isn't that what they say nowadays ? - Anyway , what are you doing Friday ? - Nothing . Or if I was , I've just cancelled it . How about dinner here ? Nothing elaborate - my man can look after us . There's nothing I 'd like better . Very good . Er ... about eight ? - How's it going ? - Everything's under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the terrace . I'll bring you a drink . Oh , jolly good . What's that - Pimm's ? Excellent . Pour away . Have one yourself , take the weight off . Calm before the storm , eh ? No , no , not in that glass . Put yours in there , huh ? Mmm . Jolly good Pimm's , that . Cheers . Cheers . Er ... I wanted to say , I know we've had our ups and downs , but I-I'm glad I come here , to help you out . So am I , Southgate . Never regretted it for a moment . Will you be popping the question tonight ? None of your damn business . Well , er ... I rather thought I would , as a matter of fact . How did you know ? Instinct . Got a nose for these things . Now , don't take this wrong , but if it was to go well for you tonight , and Mrs Franks moves in , what with Alan having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Really ? Oh , I never thought of that . I thought you 'd remain here . I've got used to you now . You're part of the furniture . - Part of the woodwork . - I know . I'm not saying it wouldn't be a wrench , but it wouldn't work . She 'd understand . Damn silly . I need you here . I won't leave you stranded . I'll call in , do a spot of cleaning , till you've found someone else . It's not just a matter of going round with a Hoover . I know that . It's not easy for me either . I've been happy here , looking back on it . You took me out of myself and I needed that . You've looked after me and I've looked after you . We've been almost like a couple , in a way . What ? Well , like a kind of a marriage sort of a thing . Have you gone off your rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and check on things in the kitchen . That could be her car . Best of luck . - You look lovely , Liz . - Sweet man . This is Southgate . Southgate , this is Mrs Franks . - Good evening , madam . - Good evening . I'll serve drinks on the terrace , as it's warm , or would you prefer inside ? Will you be chilly in that dress ? Oh , I think the terrace sounds wonderful . What a lovely idea . Thank you , Southgate . Oh , but your garden's glorious ! Should have seen it a few weeks ago . Well ... I think you've got yourself a little paradise here . It can get a bit lonely . Can it ? Care for a Pimm's ? Pimm's ? Oh , Reggie , you are clever . That's absolutely perfect . Squadron Leader ? Madam ? Dinner is served , whenever you're ready . Well , quiet as a mouse , really . She 'd been playing the stock market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stockbroker . Extraordinary . - Successfully , I hope . - Mmm . Ran it up to nearly a million . Never knew she had it in her . She sounds the exact opposite of my ex-husband . He was much better at spending it . I was left with two small children and a pile of debts . - What a bounder . - That's what he was . But still , here I am . Yes , here you are , I'm very glad to say . - Squadron Leader ? - Oh , yes . All done . - Excuse me , madam . - Thanks . That was delicious . Thank you , madam . The desserts and cheese are on the sideboard . Would you like me to serve or ... No , we'll be fine . You can take yourself off for the night . Thank you very much , Squadron Leader . I'll call in in the morning . Good night , madam . Glad you enjoyed your dinner . - Good night , Southgate . - Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , has another cup of tea , some more sandwiches with the chaps there , flies back to Biggin Hill . Weren't you terrified on those missions ? You never had time . You just got on with it . You weren't alone . Good chaps either side . They look after you , you look after them . And afterwards , when you landed , Christ , you felt so alive . Don't you wish you had children to tell about it ? No , they wouldn't understand . How could they ? "" We made England safe for you . "" "" Oh , bugger off , you old fart ! "" No ! We did have a child . What ? We did have a child . A little girl . Lovely . Lovely little thing . Her name was Cecily . We called her Tish or Tishy for some reason . Two years old . Two and a half . Good little walker . Big for her age . Always pulling on her reins . I always remember that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er ... little harness things with long straps . Yes , I remember them . Anyway ... we were out , in the town . Saturday shopping . Just out . Mary wanted to pop in somewhere , haberdasher's , something . Left me ... holding the reins . ' And I don't know , something caught my attention . - ' I looked back ... ' - Tishy ! No ! ' Died instantly . ' My fault , you see . My darling , I'm so sorry . I'm so dreadfully sorry . Poor Reggie . No , not poor Reggie . It was my fault . No good telling me any different . But it was an accident . How could you have known ? I should have looked after her , and I didn't . Cecily Mary . Aged two and a half . Beloved only child . Killed by her father's carelessness . I've never said that before . Never admitted it . Mary ... never put it into words either . It buggered our marriage , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . When she did , I couldn't . Guilt , I suppose . What do you think of me now , then ? Not er ... Not much of a man , eh ? Reggie , my poor darling , you're quite enough of a man for me . Come on , let's go upstairs . You won't leave me ? I won't leave you , my darling . And you'll marry me ? Will you marry me ? Of course I'll marry you . Liz , I've ... I've been so awful . But it ... will be different with you . Promise . You're not awful at all . You're a very dear old heffalump . Come on . Er ... I'm not sure the old hydraulics will be in good working order tonight . Don't worry . I just want to be close to you . Oh , good . I was hoping you 'd say that . I wouldn't er ... rule it out altogether , mind . # I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else but you # Undo me , please . Mm . Down in the forest , something stirred . It's the Big Bad Boy . Oh , Reggie , it's huge . Be careful , darling . Oh , darling . Mmm . # My bonnie lies over the ocean # My bonnie lies over the sea # My bonnie lies over the ocean # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me # Bring back , bring back # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me , to me # Bring back , bring back # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me ... # Darling ? I'm going to dash now . I don't want the servants to find me . Reggie ? I had a lovely time last night . Give me a ring at the shop when you're up and about . Bye , darling . Bye . Morning . Brought you a cup of tea . Another lovely morning . Come on , then . Let's be having you . What are you saying ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on . Bloody hell . I'll call an ambulance . The social worker come round yesterday . We had a bit of a chat about what next . Here he is , my pride and joy . We're doing ever so well , eh , Reggie ? We walked six steps yesterday . See you later . I'll be off , then . Anything you want bringing , next time I come ? Television ? Liz ... Ann ... Liz Franks ? Your lady friend . Ain't she been to see you yet ? No ... Is that a fact ? I'll see what I can do . He asks for you every time I go in , Mrs Franks . To be honest , I'm not awfully good at hospitals . Yes , tell him of course I'll go . Thank you , Southgate . Ah , Southgate , there you are . This is my man , Southgate . - My nephew , Lord Blyth-Gowry . - Pleased to meet you , sir . I gather you found him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner . It's not as if he was in regular touch , is it , sir ? I knew he had a nephew called Lord something . Glenmorangie , I thought , but that's the Scotch , in n it ? We are proud of the Squadron Leader . He's making marvellous progress . Can I have a cigarette , then , please ? I'm afraid not . Fewer cigarettes in the first place and you wouldn't be here . Squadron Leader , I'll pop along to the shop , get your Telegraph . Good man ! Now , look here , I think it might be a few weeks before I get down here again . Good God ! Who erm ... Who is that ? It's my fianc ? e . Excuse me . - Darling , how are you ? - Much better for seeing you . You must be Lord Blyth-Gowry . Liz Franks . How do you do ? Delighted to meet you at last . So sorry it's round his hospital bed . Oh , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to understand that this is an official engagement ? It's very recent . Though we have been together for quite a while . Yes ! Well , I'm sure you 'd like a little time to yourselves . Southgate ! Could I have a word ? What do you know about Liz Franks ? She's a gold-digger . Thinks she's onto a good thing . - Hardly for me to say , sir . - Sooner she knows she isn't , the better . She sees a wealthy old man liable to drop dead any moment . She ought to know that as his widow , she 'd get nothing , not even the house . If she sees herself as the merry widow , and I've no doubt that she does , she ought to be speedily enlightened . Are you going to put her in the picture or am I ? - I'll do it . - Fair enough . Refer her to me if she needs any confirmation . My uncle's going to need long-term residential care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at home . I'm happy to . Really ? Look here , are you sure you're up to it ? I looked after my wife , best part of a year before she died , did everything for her . I 'd want to look after the Squadron Leader . We've got used to each other . And how much would you expect to be paid for your services ? I don't want your money . I've got me pension . We managed before . Thanks very much . - Thank you for telling me . - I'm sorry , madam . Oh , for Christ's sake , do you mind not calling me madam ? - You needn't pretend you're sorry . - I've nothing against you , Mrs Franks . I never thought you was after his money . The bloody awful thing is , though , he was right in a way , that horrible man . - I can't afford to be left with nothing . - That's what I thought . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't just ... Yes . I'll tell him . Darling ! There she is . That's my fianc ? e . My lovely girl . Reggie ... Erm ... Reggie , sweetie ... Is there somewhere private we can go and talk ? Er , day room . Bit of a hole . We can smoke there , though . Southgate smuggles them in . He's a good egg , Southgate . OK ? There we are ! I'm pretty fit . What do you think ? I can do twice round the ward now . They say I can go home in a week . Not bad , eh ? Very good , Reggie . You could come and live with me when I come out . We could get married right away . Or wait , see how I turn out . You don't have to . Don't want to tie you down . You're still young , my darling . Reggie ... I've done wrong . I can't marry you . I should never have agreed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Where are you going ? - I'm going to Italy . And which ... chap ... young chap ... No , it's not a chap . Oh , Reggie , darling , you are very sweet . But I am going to leave you . There's no point in saying sorry or anything . I won't even say that I would never have made you happy . But I'm not a nice person . I thought we could have children . Reggie , darling , I'm 52 . That's extraordinary . You're like a young girl to me . Will I see you again ? No , I don't think so . Though you never know . It was that young bloody nephew of mine , wasn't it ? Sticking his nose in . It was actually Southgate who put me in the picture . Did it quite tactfully . Did he ? Well ... It's over now . You do look lovely , Liz . Please , Reggie , don't go on . I can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to rain all day . Nothing come of it in the end . What did you say to her ? Your nephew would have told her if I hadn't . She 'd have had to find out sooner or later . Only fair she should know . It's true , isn't it ? About the house . Of course it's bloody well true , you bloody idiot , but you didn't have to spill the beans ! She's gone now . Left me . She's gone abroad , my last chance of happiness . Perhaps you're better off without her . If she was only after you because she thought you was rich . Of course she thought I was rich , you bloody idiot ! Why else do you think an attractive girl like that would want me ? I never thought she loved me . But by God , I loved her , Southgate . What do you say to that ? No need to shout , sir . I'll shout if I like . Do you realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth ! - Just as well , by the look of you . - What ? Well , er ... I-I 'd better be off . He's ... a little bit upset . I'll be back tomorrow , sir . Now , wait a minute . I'll give you a hand . Thank you , Southgate . Home again , home again . Diggety-dig . Well ? - Missed your cooking , Southgate . - Good of you to say so . Though I don't remember it being as good as this . Special occasion , pulled out all the stops . - Found this wine in the cellar . - Did you ? Very nice too . Bloody hell , I've been saving that for my 70th . Three score years and ten . I think it's about time we started living for today , don't you , sir ? Put like that , Southgate , you're absolutely right . Here's to us . Cheers . The old firm back in business . Except ... we're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Well , here's to us , then . - How about a brandy ? - Better not . - Not after the wine . - You're the boss , Southgate . Tell you what , we'll have a bit of music . I was looking through your records , just yesterday . Remember this one ? Ahhh ... Moonlight Serenade , Glenn Miller , remember ? I should say so . We used to have a local hop at Biggin Hill , every Tuesday . - Come on , then . - No , I'm not up to it ! Of course you are . Like riding a bike . Up you get . I'll lead . Slow ... quick ... quick ... slow .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no skank , no nothing . J ust pure pleasure . Girl : Wait ... That hurts . - What's up , bitch ? - Shit , yo . - What happened ? - Guess . You fucked her ? I knew you fucked her . I sat here for like two hours . She was 12 , you hit that shit up . Well , who I am ? I'm the mother_fucking virgin surgeon . How was that shit , yo ? Oh , my God , so good . That girl can fuck . Word , she can fuck , yo ? Hells , yeah ! Halfway through , I'm thinking about ... "" This girl's no virgin . No virgin can fuck like this . "" You sure she's a virgin ? Hell , yeah . That bitch was bleeding , dude . When I first put it in , she all screamed all loud , and then like ... I think I saw her bite down on her pillow , but I don't know . - How long did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck her for ? Well , you know , it took me 15 minutes to talk her into it and everything . It took a little longer than I expected . But once it was on , we fucked for a good half an hour . I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in . It hurt the first time . Didn't want to come too quick . Did her puss stink ? Take a whiff . Mmm ... Butterscotch , yo . That's the best . That bitch was so clean , dude . Word ? You could tell she took care of herself . How ? ' Cause she , like , had all these like ... powders and creams in her bathroom . Let me smell that shit again . I'm telling you , man , that's why I love virgins . They're the best . Purity , man . - You know what else ? - What ? You can tell she just entered puberty . How ? ' Cause I was flipping through this picture book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her painting Easter eggs . And I was like , "" Damn , you were pretty cute when you were little . "" All right ? So , like , she was all like ... "" That picture was taken less than a year ago . I look younger without makeup . "" That's a good one . So I was like , "" Shit , this girl's a baby . "" Then I was like , "" Oh , shit ... that turns me on . I want to fuck this baby girl . "" Fucking perverted bastard , I swear . I'm tellin ' you , Cas , I'm getting addicted to this shit . To what , virgins ? It's all I think about now . Having complex fantasies and shit . - What do you mean ? - Like going all out . You mean , like fucking two virgins at once ? That would be kinda sweet , but I mean like ... when I was fucking her , right ... I kept thinking how much I wanted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grille , kid . I don't know about that . She was pretty into it . What do you want to do ? Get another 40 . Smoke a blunt or some shit . - You hungry ? - I'm fucking starving , yo . Wait up a sec . I'm taking a piss . Right up on this piece . Hey , let's go to Paul's house . Paul , what for ? That guy's a dick . Yeah , but he always got food . He got them microwave burrito things , you know ? Think he's got any herb on him ? He quit dealing , but I'm sure he'll smoke us out . - You think ? - Probably . He lives on 76th , right ? 78th . Let's be ghosts , man . Hey , Telly , she suck your dick , man ? A little bit , but I really didn't want her to . Why not , man ? Having a virgin suck your dick , that's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . But like , if you deflower a girl , man ... You're the man ! No one can ever do that again . You're the only one . No one has the power to do that again . Right . The way I see it , my outlook on the situation ... Mr . Wizard . It's like getting fame , you know ? Say you was to die tomorrow , right ? 50 years from now , all the virgins you ever fucked will remember you . They'll tell their grandkids about that shit . "" That Telly , he sure was good in the sack . "" You thirsty ? Hells , yeah . I'm fucking dehydrated . You got any money ? Three pennies and a ball of lint , kid . You down with the boost ? True . Chill a second . You happen to have diss digg ? What ? Diss digg . I'm curious , do you have it ? What is "" diss digg "" ? Diss digg . What are you saying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Diss digg . Diss digg . I don't ... I don't understand you . A'ight , one last time . Do you have diss digg ? What you say , diss digg ? He said , "" this dick , "" motherfucker . Don't you understand English ? Stupid fuck boys . Fuck you . What's up ? - It's Telly . - You like peaches ? It's Telly , man . Open up . Yo , yo ! What's up ? What's going on ? What's up ? Shit . What's all this shit , man ? Fuckin ' up our crib . Fuck the crib . Move the fuck over , you bitch ass . What's going on ? Nothin ' . Chillin ' . What y'all up to ? You want a whip-it ? Give me one of them shits . This balloon almost busted , so be careful . This video is phat . Listen for that crack . Pop that shit . I told you , be careful . How you doin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you're older . Fuck off . - My God . Look at his lip . - Check it out , nigga . Shut the fuck up , bitch ! Your lips are blue . Shut up ! You don't even know me , nigga . Look at this kid , yo . He's like a fiend . That's why I like this shit . They wake my brain up . There's more , man . - How many people live here ? - Too many . No , only eight or nine . Where does everyone sleep ? You homosexuals ? No , get the fuck out of here . Everywhere . It's a flophouse , man . We're still short on the rent . If we had a faggot , he 'd pay the rent . You and Casper can move in . You could share the bathtub . - I don't know about that . - Yo , Telly ... Jenny says , "" What's up ? "" Jenny who ? You know , Jenny . Casper : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her in forever . What's she up to ? I knew he wouldn't speak to me . That dick . You still mad at him ? Of course . How can I forgive him ? - What did he do ? - He stole her virginity . He took it away and now it's gone forever . It's not the fact that he devirginized me , it's that he never spoke to me again . He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out . But he was all like , "" Jenny , I like you so much , "" and ... "" I promise , I won't use you . "" Same lines . He was talking mad shit . The first time is always whacked . Be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the back seat of a car . - That's right . - That's nothing . I had just turned 14 . With this asshole who was 18 . I can't remember his name . This was at sleep away camp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bushes , around midnight . I got fucking mosquito bites all over my ass . I thought nobody knew about it , but everyone knew the next day . - And the pain was ... - Hell , yeah ! - The fucking pain ! Jesus ! - That's the shit . God , the pain ! The fucking pain ! Jesus ! You feel like you're being ripped open . You are being ripped open inside . - Did you bleed ? - No , I didn't . - You didn't bleed ? - I bled all over . On the condom , everywhere . You know what he started singing ? "" Sunday , Bloody Sunday . "" - "" Sunday , Bloody Sunday . "" - That stupid fucking song . I was like , "" What the hell ? "" I couldn't believe he did that to me . Then everyone at camp was singing that the whole time . You know what ? I have sex and I like fucking . Hell , yeah . I love sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . It's the best thing , right ? That's it . No , no , not sex . Foreplay . Foreplay . Hardcore pound fucking . That's the shit right there , man . That's the only way to do it . It's that boom , boom , boom . But there's a difference between making love ... having sex and then fucking . Right . Making love is like ... It's , like , sweet . It's real slow . Real slow . Sex is like , "" All right , let's have sex . Let's go , come on . "" Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's the whole thing . They want you to be so kind , so gentle , like you give a fuck or something . - What's up , Jav ? - What's up ? What are you doing with a cigarette ? Like you care ? Yeah , right . Most of the time , you just want to be all pounding that shit . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb . If you could just be like , "" Excuse me , miss , can I borrow your hole ? It'll only take a little bit . I'll give it right back . "" - Right . - "" I'm done . "" But that's it . You got to take it slow . You got to be smooth . Girls like it slow and romantic . Fuck romance . I like it hard and nasty . I've been with a lot of girls , so I know . Me too , nigga . What's up ? But it depends . I was at Eric's house . Smash J was there . D.J . Flipper was there . All right ? He was horny . He threw me on the bed . We started getting it on . They were in the room getting dressed . They were going to a disco . That shit was so good . He was fucking fingering me , sucking on my tits . I was like , "" You go , boy . "" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , our lips were busted . I was like , "" Work it , boy . "" But y'all know why I go out with Alex , right ? He has the best fucking fingers I ever had . I'm going out with him . He got it going on . That's that . That's why foreplay is better than sex . They can touch you and you're going crazy and all of a sudden , it's like , "" What the hell happened ? "" - J ust a big disappointment . - It's a letdown . Then it takes them either too long , or too short to come . Have you ever had someone who took forever ? What , to come ? Let me tell you . I was having sex with Jake , and it took my man an hour and a half . I don't have no hour and a half . No , no , no . You know what I notice , though ? Bitches love to suck dick . It's like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All bitches , man . I know , man , I'm telling you . Casper's right . They act like they don't in front of their friends , to try to get respect . When you get them alone , it's the first thing they go for . The girls just grab your dick , start sucking . They know they're in charge of something . Only time they feel prosperous . - I'm telling you . - They love that shit . That's why girls live longer than guys . Sperm's got vitamin C in that shit . The shit's nutritious , right ? Looking at your watch . You know what's the worst ? Sucking dick . I hate sucking dick . They'll be shooting you in the eye , and the ear and shit . And you don't know what to do . It hits that little thing ... the tonsils , the esophagus , whatever the hell it is . - You don't get anything out of it . - You'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You don't get shit . Have you ever swallowed it before ? No . Me neither . - I have . - Of course . No , but it was like ... No , it's like sweet and sour and salty butter . It's like ... it's just nasty . You drink and drink and you can not get ... the taste out of your mouth . The sperm get stuck in your teeth . They're disgusting . You got ta sit down and eat a whole real meal . All I know is that condoms suck . They don't work . They either slip off , or break , or make your dick shrink . You got a small condom , huh ? We still got to use them . I did once . Telly's the only guy I've had sex with . - I thought you had sex with A.J . - No , we just messed around . That's the whole thing , you know ? You hear of all these diseases . Disease this , disease that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up . I don't know no kid with AIDS . Ain't no one I know died from that shit . Fucking , that's just some make-believe story . It's bullshit ! We all going to die anyway . I'm going to go out fucking . - Yeah . - You know what I'm saying ? One guy got tested . He was negative . This other guy ... he 'd fucked only two other girls , and they were virgins , so he was safe . But then this other guy I just fucked , which was a mistake . Heat of the moment kind of thing . But I went to the clinic last week with Jenny ... to get ourselves checked , to be safe . Jenny went ? She got tested with me so that I didn't have to be alone . Word , they ask a lot of questions ? Jenny ... how old are you ? 16 . How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ? - One . - Were you protected ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 17 . How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ? Altogether ? Yes , altogether . I 'd say eight . Maybe nine . How many times did you go in unprotected ? Four times I went unprotected . Maybe it was three . Have you ever had anal intercourse ? No . Have you ever had anal intercourse ? Yeah . With how many different people ? I think three , but I'm not sure . Were they wearing condoms ? Yes , with two of them . Twice I didn't . I didn't ... two times . We're going to draw some blood from you . Come back in seven days ... and we should have the results of your tests , okay ? Thanks . You see that pork fried rice store ? The Chinese joint ? Yeah . My cousin lives right up there . He's mad . Crazy . His name is Harmonoff . One time we went to Special Olympics on a school trip . Seventh grade , whatever . He tried to pick up these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got a thing for them . He caught one dope bitch that day ... she had those leg braces and shit . But she had a fat ass . You're crazy . Ruthless . He brought her into the bathroom and fucked the shit out of her . He was telling me that the leg braces were scratching up his shit . He hit her hard , yo . She was all drooling and shit . So , he's pretty crazy ; he'll do whatever to bust a nut . - You know ? - That's ruthless shit . He wanted to take the leg braces off , but he was just like "" Fuck it . "" "" Let's hit this up real quick . "" Telly : Like quickie style . ? ? The summer's gone ? ? ? ? And all the roses dying ... ? ? Man , this guy's really good , yo . He reminds me of my uncle . - I bet he brings mad dough in , yo . - Hells , yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ? ? ? ? It's I'll be here ? ? ? ? I n sunshine or shadow ... ? ? I don't think I want to be seein ' him anymore . I want to date other people . I don't know . I think he's mad at me or something . But who cares ? It's like , "" Get off your high horse . If I want to see other guys I'll see other guys . "" So it's just like ... I can't deal with that jealous crap . I don't know why I see him in the first place . He's a jerk ! Giving me a hard time . That crap . I think I'm just gon na dump him completely . I was just tryin ' to be nice , but if he's gon na get ... It must have been something I ate . Ruby , follow me . - Wish me luck . - Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases and infections . Yes ! You're clean . I can't tell you how nervous I was . I didn't sleep last night . Now you have to be careful , Ruby , okay ? I want you to take these pamphlets and read them . And , Ruby , read them . Jenny , you've tested positive for the H IV virus . What ? The test isn't 100% accurate . I tested positive ? I'm sorry . I only had sex with Telly . I just came to keep Ruby company . Yo , I want to fuck Darcy . Who ? You know Darcy . Bennie's little sister . You like her , uh-huh ? Yo , I liked her for a while , yeah . Darcy , yo ? She's so little , innocent and pretty .

But what if you can't make yourself happy ? Well then I don't know . You know what you do then ? You forget . Block it out . I remember ... when my grandmother told me how to be happy .

Harold ! Fuck you . I thought you had a girlfriend . No , I ain't seeing nobody . What about you ? I can't . My mom won't let me have a boyfriend . She won't ? Why not ? I don't know .

I can understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other . Sure . We do it all the time . - Holy shit . - Holy s ... damn ! Casper : You guys are dykes , right ?

Well , what are you going to do , sit out here all night long ? Lilli , if they didn't like your paintings ... why would they put you in the show ? Why ? Because the curator doesn't have a fucking clue . Or you know what ? Maybe he does have a clue ... but when he was picking out the paintings ... he was , like , sick that night and not paying attention . Or they're using my work ... to make somebody else's work look better ... like a conspiracy . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You're starting to make me look confident . Are you going to ... come inside ? Wait . Will you just wait here ? Lilli Black ... I 'd like you to meet Anne Friar from The New York Times . Congratulations . Thank you very much .

Man on radio : District attorney Jack Craft will be holding a press conference later this morning in Angels Crest . It's expected that Mr . Craft will address the case of three-year-old Nathan Denton , who was found frozen to death last week after his father Ethan Denton had left him in the truck . I told them not to let anyone in yet , but ... you okay ? Yeah . It's smaller than I remember . - What ? - The coffin . - You went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll be fine . Maybe we should just postpone . No , no , no . How much time do we have ? - 10 minutes . - 10 minutes . ( @knock_on_door ) - Man : Jack . - Yes . Woman : District Attorney , any comment on the accusations ? Man : Mr . Craft , can you separate this case from your own past ? The state is filing charges against Ethan Denton for the death of his son Nathan Denton . Now , we are not claiming that Ethan Denton deliberately killed his son . However , his decision to leave the boy alone in a truck during a blizzard directly led to his death , and therefore constitutes an act of criminal negligence . Woman : Jack , are you the right man to be prosecuting ? - Thank you . - Jack , Jack , without being personal ... Jack , any correlation between this case ... I'm so sorry . Ethan , we need to talk . Okay . You keep in mind that I have never hated my job more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta take you in . For what ? Now , you'll be able to get a lawyer . Right now ? - Right now . - Okay . Okay . - Did you see Bill , Angie ? - Yeah . Has everybody lost their minds completely ? - It was an accident . - Calm down , Jane . - Nobody's saying it wasn't . - Ethan is a great kid . Why am I the only person who's angry about this ? He just should have taken better care is all . Hey , sweetheart . ( kisses ) I'm so sorry Mommy took such a long time . ( Childrenplaying ) ( trainhornblaring ) ? I wish I had a dime ? ? For every bad time ... ? ( Chatter ) Hi . I'm Jane Childs . I don't believe we've met . I'm Joanne Mills . It's nice to meet you .

Can I get you anything ? Do you know where Cindy is ? What's that ? It's medicine . You have a tummy ache ? Yeah , something like that . So , you gon na go to the bathroom or what ? - I know how to go myself . - Good for you . I left Paul Jr . In the car once overnight when he was about Nate's age . Man : Really ? Crying like a banshee the next morning , but no worse for the wear . - Never told Donna . - Man : Smart . Of course , it was summertime . Wouldn't have left him out there in the winter . Yeah , so long as it was summertime . You poor thing . What you must be going through ... I can just imagine . But you rest assured , Nate is in a better place . ( gasps ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - She's just not herself . - Cindy : Oh , God ! Sit down . You came , huh ? I missed the funeral because you gave me the wrong time . You have very nice friends here . ( Scoffs ) The woman sewing coffee , she introduced herself . She was very nice . Jane ? - Yes , Jane . - She's a dyke . Jane says we need some more napkins . I'm getting them . I'm getting them . ( Grunting ) Hey , hey , whoa . I'll help , okay ? It's cool . It's not cool . I've been trying to call Ethan's dad for days , leaving messages , and I just don't understand why he's not here . Ethan needs someone . No , Ethan doesn't need his dad right now . - How do you know ? - I know Ethan . Look , maybe it's you that needs someone . All right . What ? I've got ta go . Rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Good , baby . Good , sweetheart . Oh . Hey , what's this ? What's this you're wearing ? I thought it was a wedding . Oh . Yeah , baby , it's ... it's not a wedding . Guard : You still play ball ? That's too bad . You were good . Oh , thanks , man . We got a softball league . Play against the fire department . It's not real or anything , but , you know , it's something . Right . You ever think of a career in law enforcement ? We could use an arm like yours . ( Scoffs ) Man on TV : Ethan Denton made bail this morning after pleading not guilty to the charges against him - for his role in the death ... - Not guilty , my ass ! I hope that jury fucking puts him away . Whatever happens , it's in the hands of the Lord now . That's supposed to be comforting ? What are you doing with my beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your god , I have mine . Denton will not be making a statement at this time . When will he be ready to make a statement ? ( Reportersclamoring ) - Hey , hey , hey . We're on your side , Ethan . Come on , just give us ... Rusty : Ethan . Hey , hold up . Come on ... Ethan . Shit . ( @horn_blaring ) ( brakessqueaking ) Hey , man . Where you heading ? Nowhere . You can crash at my place if you want or at the garage . We're closed down for the week . Whose idea was that ? Mine . - Hungry ? - No . - I can pick you something up ... - Where were you that morning ? What you talking about , man ? Come on , where were you ? Don't be stupid .

You know how close Nate was to the truck ? Less than a quarter-mile . ( Bottlehisses ) ( capclinks ) ( gunfire ) ( electronicbeeping ) - Dude , are you looking at my screen ? - I never , ever ... You were looking at my screen , man . Beer . Think they let you game in prison ? I'm just saying , I mean , no work , no bills , just you and the console . For five years ? Some games take five years , man . Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll let me out after three . ( laughing ) For good behavior ? ( @car_horn_honking ) - You want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Fuck . Fuck . - Oh , shit ! You crazy bitch ! Get the fuck out of here ! Get out of here ! Yeah , come on . Come on . ( grunts ) Not guilty , my ass ! ( grunts ) Is your dad alive ? No . I bet he was a good dad , though , right , when he was alive ? You being a lawyer and all , I imagine he 'd be real proud . Something like that . My dad's not dead . He's not proud , either . As a matter of fact , he's not even here . I don't blame him . He probably doesn't even know . That's why he's not here . My dad is a shit dad . But if he knew , I know he 'd be right here , digging up this grave with his fingernails , lifting Nate out from the earth , giving him mouth-to-mouth . He 'd try and bring him back to me . He would . Because what dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? I'm very sorry for your loss . What are you doing here ? - Here you go , number 21 . - That was fast . ( Cookchuckles ) Smells good . What can I get for you ? What's the special ? It's open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy . That sounds good . - To go ? - No . I 'd recommend it . Well , actually I was hoping to speak to you , Ms . Manning . One turkey . - I'm busy . To go . - Well , maybe another time . Oh , I'm always busy . Here you go , Frank . Sir . Yeah . You have any kids ? Once upon a time , yeah . ( @door_closes ) ( classicalmusicplaying ) ( vehicleapproaches ) Jane . - Hi . - Woman : Hi . Come in .

Jane : These are Roxie's paintings , all of them . - You're reading too much into it . - Yeah , right . Well , what do you want me to say , Roxanne ? He was raised by my ex-husband . Oh , you know me , bean pole . - I'm just venting . - Yeah , thanks for the support . What ? I'm hungry . I want that . - Not for us . - What ? I'll be back before you know it . Oh , no . No , you're not leaving me here alone . You're not leaving me here to babysit your homophobic son and his knocked-up little girlfriend . - Bye . - Jane . ( @door_closes ) Hey . Hey . Hi . Why don't you take a little break , let me fix you something to eat ? You know , I locked the door when I got out . - I locked the truck . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high . I closed the door really fast when I got out s-so that it w-would stay warm . He was still warm when I left him . He didn't know how to get out of his seat . That's the thing ... he didn't ... didn't know how to do that . - I know , baby . - You know ? I know . ( Crying ) I know . It's not your fault . It's not your fault . What are you doing here ? I don't know . I couldn't think of anywhere else to go . Rosie's fast asleep . - How about I get you a cup of coffee ? - Yeah . I was with Cindy that morning . I know . I saw you there . Thanks . Oh , so you think that if you hadn't been there , maybe things would have been different . That DA came by here . The thing is , I never thought that Ethan was that great of a dad . No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , but there were always little things , like he would let him out of his sight for a moment too long or he would drink beer in the truck . And I never said anything . Never . ( bedthumping ) ( Melodygiggling ) - Oh , Jesus Christ . They're young . I 'd better not have to fucking listen to that every other night . We won't . They're leaving soon . He just wants money . Yeah , well , what did you expect ... love ? You left him when he was 10 years old . I know . ( sighs ) Can I help you ? Uh , I was just gon na take a closer look . That's why we have display models . I'm sorry . I'll put it back . Here , let me do that . Hey , you haven't had a recall on this item or anything , have you ? We wouldn't be selling it if there was a recall . Do you get many complaints ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beltclicks ) Or this , the latch , not staying buckled ? - Not that I know of . - Anything ? Look , why don't you just go online and look at some consumer reviews or something ? You know , that's a real good idea . Thanks . Woman over P.A . : Can I have a price check for Similac on aisle three , please ? I just need just a little bit of clarity here , because I'm trying to figure out what's happening . The insurance claim was denied ? - We don't actually know . - I think so , yeah . Ethan and Nate stayed with you guys , correct ? Yeah , the water damage destroyed the kitchen . It was inconvenient for them to stay there during construction , so , yeah , they stayed with us . - Well , who paid for the construction ? - Ethan did . He worked overtime to pay for it . He's a very hard worker . Because the insurance claim was denied ? I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The faucet in the tub was left on for hours . It was negligence . Thank you . - What ? - Nothing . What ? Speak your mind for once , please . - It's not really the time . - Why not ? Who gives a fuck what this guy thinks ? Say it . Ever since I told you George was coming , you've been a total cunt . Well , just give me one more question , you guys , and I'll get out of your hair . How long did Ethan and Nate stay with you guys after Ethan flooded the house ? Ethan didn't flood the house . He wasn't even there . Cindy was . ( @baby_crying ) - Joanne : You like it black ? - I do , thank you . Okay . Jack : Oh , I'm sorry if I woke you . Let me introduce myself . I'm Jack Craft . - This is the district attorney . - Nice to meet you . I need coffee . I had her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know if you're aware of this , but the state is prosecuting Ethan Denton for his role in Nate's death . It's Cindy . And I know all about the trial . I was wondering if you 'd be willing to help me . Like what ? Testify ? No , no , no . That's getting way ahead of ourselves . I was just trying to get some background information . Like what ? Like , you know , what kind of father Ethan was , you know , from your perspective . - My perspective ? - Yeah . ( sighs ) You may not be aware of this , but ... Fuck . But I have an itsy bitsy problem with alcohol . That's why Nate lived with Ethan in the first place . You're not the one that's on trial here ; Ethan is . You may be an alcoholic , but you're not the one who chose to drive your son into the woods in a snowstorm . You didn't , totally sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to track a deer ... a fucking deer . Excuse me . Ethan's actions would be more understandable ... not less negligent , but more understandable , had he been drunk at the time . That's a twisted fucking argument . Now , maybe he chose an inappropriate babysitter . Maybe he's done a lot of fucked-up things during his life . Maybe this isn't the first time that he chose hunting over taking care of his son . All I'm asking is for you to think about it , all right ? If something comes to you , if you remember anything , you simply write it down . I've taken too much of your time . Not at all . You ladies have a good morning . - Jack : Thank you so much . - Thank you . God be with you . Cindy : He seems really smart , doesn't he ? I guess . I think he's gon na put Ethan away . Maybe . Why didn't you give Nathan the birthday present I sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance . I was going to . Just , uh ... I saw it in the closet and I wondered . - I was going to . - I believe you . What did you give him ? Made to order . Oh , best thing I ever put in my mouth . - You want some ? - I don't do dick . - Hey , Ange . - Hey , Rusty . Can you take some food over to the garage for me , for Ethan ? Oh , now's not really a good time . No ? Okay , I'll have Rox take it over for me . So , can I get you guys anything else ? - Ethan . - Hi . Hi . - What are you doing here ? - I got ... Oh , this is Melody . She's the uh ... Knocked-up little girlfriend of Jane's homophobic son . Yeah . ( clearsthroat ) Hey , that's a cute seat . I was thinking of getting one . It's a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food for you . ( TVplayinginbackground ) I'll be right back . - What do you use ? - Bolt action , 30-30 . - Here you go . - Thanks . Can I buy you a cup of coffee ? Not in this lifetime . Just a heads up then ... you'll be getting a subpoena . All right . ( clearnsthroat ) I'm not testifying against Ethan . You were with him when he found Nate . All I expect you to do is describe that experience , that's it . - I can do that . - All right . I can tell about how I never saw a person so wrecked as Ethan when he dug up his son from the snow . I can tell the jury how much bullshit this trial is and how losing your own kid doesn't give you license to shit on the rest of us . I'll ask you how Nate was found , what he was wearing , how he looked when you saw him , the state of his toes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - You answer all my ... ( thuds ) ( @door_opens ) ( bucklesclicking ) Hey , man . Hey . I ... I just came by to say ... I'm sorry . You know , I'm just really sorry . For what ? For not being there when you called . For Cindy . It doesn't matter . It really doesn't matter . What you doing there ? I can't figure the goddamn thing out . I read online all these complaints about it , right ? Like , this one woman , she said that the buckle would just come undone . Like , it would just pop open after she buckled her kid in . So I kept taking the damn thing apart and putting it back together , and I can't find the glitch . What glitch ? You know , the glitch ... the glitch that , you know , makes the buckle come undone . ( sighs ) Okay . I have to ... I have to get this kind of evidence , you know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash at my place for a while ? No , no , no . No . I'm really fine here . I'm fine . Yeah , yeah , you know , I can see that , but , you know , I thought maybe you could use a fresh pair of eyes , you know . We can bring the car seat , work on it together . You 'd work on it with me ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . Come on . We'll go get some food , camp out at my place . It'll be great . - I don't know , man . - Dude ... this place reeks anyway , man , you know ? Man , come on . I don't even know what this is , you know ? It was once upon a time bacon , but now ... Jeez . All right . Thanks , man . All right . I'll get the seat . - You got it ? - Oh , yeah . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't know . It's been a while . - Oh , yeah ? First thing I'm gon na do is take a hose to that skinny-ass body of yours . - I just got ta lock up . - Okay . Ethan : See you there . ( Countrymusicplaying ) Whiskey ? - Hey , Cindy . - Hey . What are you doing here ? Same thing as you , I guess . Have you seen Ethan ? Not really . I thought you two were close . No , Jane's the one . But you used to take care of ... Sometimes , yeah . Was he good for you ? - The best . - Good . He was a good baby , too . He didn't cry too much . We 'd build forts in the living room with pillows and blankets and shit . He loved that . Yeah . That must have been fun . No , not really . I 'd set the pillows up , he 'd pull them down , throw them all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck over again , but it was fun for him . It's on me . Man on radio : To know that Jesus is your savior , but he's also your friend . You can put your trust in Him . ( @piano_music_playing ) Let us pray to the Lord . Can you hear me , O Lord ? ? Can you hear me ? ? When I ask You to be my friend . ? Be my friend ... ? There's only one way to come to Jesus ... Where have you been ? - At work , I told you that .

"
"@@4683259 As a child , you spent hours on this swing . Why the long face ? - Can I ask you a question ? - Sure . Did you have another love before grandpa ? He was the only man in my life . I married because I had no choice , but I learned to love him . Back then they said : "" A woman without a trade has two options : Marriage or prostitution . "" That's about the same . What if you could start anew ? - Would Pepe be the man of your life ? - No . If I could start anew I 'd get fucked as much as I could . Everyone should share your ideas . A man who gets laid is a super macho . If it's a woman , she's a slut . - Sexual equality . - Forget what they say ! If they made love more and spoke less ... - It would be better . - It's not that simple . What isn't ? Pay no mind , grandma . - It's hard to explain . - You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts , ideas , problems on a sheet of paper , but interrogatively so you can see them from outside and understand them . I did that at you age , and it helped a lot . And I still do , but so as not to forget . Dinner is ready . Come on . When you made love with grandpa , how was it ? You're very curious . Come , I've made shellfish meatballs for you . Enough for you to take to Barcelona . I lost my virginity on the 17th of July , 1993 , at 2:46 in the morning . It was during a vacation period , when I was 15 . You never forget a moment like that . - Are you okay ? - Yes . I remember I felt nothing , just deep shame for not having bled , and that strange feeling of having pissed in bed . I left with the excuse of the toilet , with the feeling my experience with Edouard couldn't be like that . A feeling that made me go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing here ? - Again . - Once again ? No , hundreds of times . Hundreds of times . That strange release of energy aroused in me a desire to communicate through my body , a curiosity to experience sensations through a kiss , a caress or the contact of my skin . 14 years after my first experience with Edouard I live in Barcelona and still have the same urge to experiment through my body . DIARY OF A NYMPHOMANIAC - My diary , it was here . - You're writing a diary ? - I follow your advice . - I didn't tell you to . Just to jot down your problems for a better perspective . Diaries are for lonely people . That's not true . They have something to tell . Because their life is different . And they always hope that someone will discover it , read it to get to know the true personality of the author . Right , because they feel lonely . It's the third blackout this week . - The dark still scares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't speak badly of me in your diary . Of course not . Could you write something for me ? That you're not alone , that I'm with you . It's about time . I'm unbearable in the dark . Unbearable . You smell of fields , of wet , recently cut grass . Why don't you stay over ? No , I can't . Tomorrow I have a meeting and must prepare my presentation . Alex , why don't you ever stay to sleep with me ? Please ? You don't want me to sleep . No . Don't you ever get tired ? Val , I can't keep up with your pace . Besides , I told you I have a meeting tomorrow . Come on . Hassan . Valerie . Nice to hear you . You disappeared into thin air but I found you ? I'll be in Barcelona this week . I want to see you ? - How about Thursday ? - Okay , I'll call you . A kiss . - Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I'll see him Thursday . Back to my desk , things are getting rough . What is ? They're restructuring . I've heard that ever since I'm here . Yeah , well ... I've been asked what I feel when I make love . It's like a mix of energy with the other person that makes me fly and merge with the cosmos . The energy of my orgasm is a small part of me that goes and ends up mixing with the universe . A sidereal trip that takes me to infinity . In my country they say Allah told the south wind that he 'd create the Arabian horse from it . "" So be it "" , said the wind . He held a puff and tied it to the horse's mane so it wouldn't forget where it came from , but it turned out to be so fast and cunning that no one could ride it , and it was Ishmael , the first faithful , who was able to tame one of them and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to tame than that first horse . I don't know how to name you . Are you calling me wild ? Yes . I think I've never fucked you in a bed . We can do that now , if you want . Although ... I've just had a better idea . Here , look . Where are they ? You've hidden them again ? No . Not now , Hassan , please . I don't feel like it right now , not today , no . Here they are ! No , please . No . Not today . Yes , yes , today . Look , look , come on . Good morning . Be careful , Val , you're late again . Want one ? I don't want to even see them , I need coffee . I bought a dress for Marcos ' wedding . When I tried it on I realized I couldn't zip it up . So I cried like a baby and then I called you . You knew about Hassan . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . I'm thinking of publishing an ad to find a boyfriend . An ad ? What do you mean ? You have to stop being obsessed . How can you find him not going out ? I don't want just one-night stands . You must try before falling in love . I need to fall in love , Val , find a man who loves me and perhaps buy me flowers now and then . I rather he fucks well . I'll buy the flowers . I can't stand not having anyone to talk to at home , to wake up alone and find half a lemon in the icebox . Love fills iceboxes and mine's been empty for a long time . I was worried . You didn't call yesterday to say good night . I got home late . I had dinner with some friends . - Did you like the meatballs ? - Yes , delicious . I'm hanging up . I must finish your sweater ? - I love you , I love you . ? - Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What ? - Tame me . You deserve some flowers . I want to fuck all night long . I can't . I can't . I can't , Val . - I have to go . - What's the matter ? No , Val . Val , Val , Val , Val . I have to tell you something . - You have a girlfriend . - You knew ? I imagined but , don't worry , I'm not jealous . Besides , I never asked you if you were alone . It's not my problem . I didn't think you 'd take it like that . You wanted me to cry ? Val , we must stop seeing each other . I want to fly . Val , Val , Val . Haven't you understood ? Can't you think of anything else ? You got a problem . You can't spend all day thinking about fucking . I do , but you're an S.O.B .. Don't ever call me again , okay ? Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loneliness , the silence . I need some air . What ? Are you new here ? This is my turf , baby ! Beat it ! Go work somewhere else . Some days I 'd spend hours in the shower , feeling the water , forgetting everything . But I can't get Alex off of my mind . I liked him a lot . Like him , many others just want to fuck me , and I like that , but it hurts because , above all , I'm a woman . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . It's not fair , Val , they're pigs . You give them part of your life , and they fire you . Want a hand ? Forget it , I was fed up anyway . Weren't you on a diet ? How can I be being so depressed ? You get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valerie can't attend to you , she no longer works here . Bye . Yes ? Speaking . I got furious when I found out they called you . Thanks for coming , but there's no need . I got a few days vacation at work . I 'd have come anyway . Don't look like that , Val . I've no intention of dying so soon . It was just a slight problem . My heart is holding out . Doctors always exaggerate . - What is wrong with you ? - Nothing . Val , I know you well . Is it over a man ? One ? Over all of them . Do you know what nymphomania is ? I think that's my problem . I can't control it . I need sex . I see a man and I need him . But no one understands that . People stare at me . It happens with strangers that don't attract me . I'm scared . Scared of not being like other women . Scared of being hurt someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not having a family . Nymphomania , a man's invention to make women feel guilty if they break the rules . Everyone is the way they are . Never give up anything you really long for because you'll regret it . Believe me . To me , I think that you don't dare to live your life . Want a piece of advice ? Enjoy life as much as you can . And go get my sweater , I want to finish it . You should rest , grandma . I've rested enough . Go on and get my knitting . Go on . CALL VAL I've lost the only person who understood me . I feel absolutely alone . I 'd like to have the company of a man to comfort me , but I haven't the strength to go looking for him . I'm exhausted . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . I called you a lot . You could at least answer . What happened ? I know that my sex life is harming me , and that I can't go on like this . Although I'm sunk , I'm looking for work . Okay , you're the person I need . You speak English , you have knowledge of marketing . We sell a lot to France , and you 'd take care of our communications , go with me to fairs , and have a ham for Christmas . - A ham ? - I give them to my employees . You can't say we foreigners don't integrate . Interested ? I have another interview today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Okay . I see you're very observant . You see , we're moving . Why did you quit your last job ? They cut down on personnel , including me , Mr ... Rijas , Jaime Rijas . What ? Rijas and Associates , general manager . You're a graduate in business administration and applied foreign languages . A really impressive curriculum . - May I ask you something ? - Sure . - Are you married ? - No . Engaged ? I think that is irrelevant . Yes , you're right , but in this job one must travel the world over . There's no commitment on my part . Would you like to ask me anything else on the salary , or whatever ? What perfume do you use ? Well now , you really have a very , very good sense of smell . It's a special lavender perfume . Yes ? Valerie ? Yes , speaking . It's Jaime Rijas ? How are you ? Oh , hello . I've made a decision , but have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . What sort of problem ? I think I can speak openly to you . Would you mind talking about this over a drink ? Can't we do that in your office ? I 'd prefer a quieter place ? My secretary interrupts constantly . I'm 39 and have always been a businessman with clear ideas , but nothing like this had ever happened to me before . And I thought it was important to talk about it with someone without prejudice , and you're that person . Why ? You hardly know each other . Precisely because we don't know each other at all , your opinion will be more objective . That all depends . I met a woman at work and , due to my status as director general , I don't know what to do . I've always controlled my impulses but his thing , - it's getting out of hand . - She works in your company ? Not yet . Does she know ? She's smart and I think she has realized there's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m afraid she may not feel the same for me . Sorry . Did I step on you ? - The table's small . - That's okay . You're beautiful , Valerie . I 'd like to buy you a rose , but I have no money . Or do I ? I forgot to tell you something . The job was yours until this evening . But from now on I don't think I couldn't order you around . - Good night . - Good night . Any relatives ? Two grown boys , but he's been separated for years . Isn't he too old for you ? He's the smartest man I've ever met . He's intelligent , polite , cultured , caring . He's got it all . I had never felt like this before . When I see him my heart leaps and his hands drive me crazy . Val , you , in love ? As a child I 'd let my balloons go . I liked to watch them rise . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m in love , but I like him a lot . He's different from all the other men . Maybe you too were born for matrimony . Not so fast . I feel a normal woman for the first time in my life , a feeling that fascinates me , to be like all other women I meet . I see Jaime nearly every day . I realize I've discovered something as important as sex . The love of a man . I have fallen madly in love for the first time in my life . He takes me to the best places , and always picks me up . In his Jaguar ? I 'd like that , really . A boyfriend with a Jaguar . And how is he in bed ? I don't know yet . You're in love ! Jaime , you need to use a condom . Really ? I want to feel you . - Is it necessary ? - Yes . Okay , no problem . I'll go get one . And while you're at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caress me . Sorry I was so fast , but I've had a tiring day . Don't worry . It's okay . Could you leave the light on ? You should fear nothing now , you have me . And tomorrow will be a very , very special day . You'll see . Today we finally made love . I hardly felt anything , like the first time with Edouard . But I love him and he loves me . That's the most important to me . - It's marvellous . - Yes . The office . Don't look , it's all a mess right now . I'm living a marvellous dream with Jaime from which I don't want to wake . A room with a view , wooden floors . Nice ? The corresponding full bathroom , and here is our bedroom . Look , and the bathroom ... This closes completely . Black out , really . It's the perfect size . 3 bedrooms . Yes , our room , the office downstairs , and another for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said you wanted children soon , but don't take that as pressure , please . The windows are 6 stories tall . I've always dreamed of a view of the sea , but it's too expensive , darling . Don't you worry , okay ? That's up to me , and period . And how is he in bed ? Truthfully , nothing out of this world . He comes too fast . He says he works too much . You always said sex is most important . Maybe because I wasn't in love . Val , I think it's a bit soon to go live together . You haven't been going out long . You said I should change my life , and I'm doing just that . Being with him , I feel , for the first time , no need for anyone else . Besides , I'm nearly 29 .

With that dress on , you look beautiful . To you ? Are you okay ? Of course I am , but I feel a bit uncomfortable . You're paying it all . You spent a fortune on furniture . What good is money if you can't spend it ? When you find a job , we'll talk about this again . See anything ? It's beautiful . Thanks , Jaime , but you can't pay it all and give me these gifts . It's to say I love you . Sorry , did I step on you ? The table's small . What a son of a bitch ! What ? There's no need . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many men . I don't want to think about that now . You're mine only . Mine only . Don't talk . What are you doing ? Embrace me . Aren't you afraid ? Not any longer . Yes ? - Valerie ? - Yes , speaking . - Hi , it's Harry . - Hi , Harry . Could I see you this morning ? Sure , I'll be there in half an hour . See you . I hired a girl , but she was a disaster . She didn't last a week . If you're willing , you could start right now . Right now ? Yes , I need someone urgently . We present the collection in 3 weeks . We're up to here . We haven't spoken about money yet . A ham for Christmas . Right , Maite ? - A client is waiting . - I'll be right there . Thanks . Don't worry about money . We'll reach an agreement . Coffee ? Hello . I have very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . - What ? I called your cell phone but it was off . - Harry wants me to start right ... - Harry ? - They're ... - Who the fuck is Harry ? The boss , an Italian . I've been hired by a fashion firm . An Italian ? He hired you just like that ? Not knowing how you work ? How weird . Isn't that weird ? You're still young and have a lot to learn . What's wrong ? I thought you 'd be happy about my job . And I am . I am happy , but I didn't expect it , and that's why I reacted that way . But I am happy . Forgive me . Really , forgive me . That night , that marvellous dream I thought I was living began to turn into a nightmare . I just give an account that I did not know the person of which I had fallen in love . When the catalogues ? They should be printed tomorrow . You do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patience ! - What's going on ? - I'll bust your chops ! What are you doing here ? So , you're the one who wants to fuck my wife ? Why is she here so late ? You think I don't know what's going on ? You think I don't know ? Jaime , go home . I'll be there soon . Right away , darling . Wait for me . I'll wait outside . Get up . Come on , get up . How are you ? Did you sleep well ? Darling , you know what I've thought ? That we could both use a trip . Forgive me , my love . Forgive me . Truthfully , I am very stressed . I can't forget my problems . We'll go on vacation , and we'll be fine . Don't touch me ! It would be best for us to separate . Separate ? My darling , we can't separate . I can't live without you . If you leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little love , please . You have to understand me . Give me a chance , I'm in bad shape . Jaime , you're not well . You're a compulsive liar , your moods are unpredictable . You're aggressive , you come to work and show me up . You're not acting in a normal way . - You need to see a doctor . - I'll do as you wish . Whatever you want , but don't leave me . Please , you can't leave me . I need you . - When did you get here ? - Today . You're unrecognizable . You know what I'm thinking about ? Kuhaylan . Remember ? The first Arabian horse . I think than man learned to tame it . Honestly , you're unrecognizable , Valerie . You need to be alone . Look at me . You know you can always count on me . People don't change , but I had hopes of doing so with Jaime . Sonia was right . I'm blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can't go on . All I want to do is lose consciousness , disappear from this world . Oh , Val , Val ! Why don't you take a vacation ? It would do you well . I appreciate it . You're right , I can't work like this . I can't concentrate . And don't forget to take the ham . Hit him with it and make it look like an accident . Were you not gay , you and I would be together . Oh , Madonna ! Yes , yes , that's it . Do it . Don't stop . Darling , look , I have a Christmas present for you . - What's your name ? - Vane . Vane , this is Val . Val , this is Vane . We make up a perfect team . Come here , my love . Come here , love , come here . Please , come here . We could have a great time . - What's your name ? - Vane . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here . Come , my darling . What tits , huh ? What tits ! The biggest thing you've got , bitch . You've got a piercing , huh ? That's enough . Get off , off , off ! Where's my money ? I have no cash , you know ? - Where are my 100 euros ? - I don't know . I have no idea . Jaime , we're expecting a baby . What ? We're expecting a baby . That's impossible . Why is it impossible ? I don't doubt you're expecting , I doubt it's mine . How can you say that ? You know why I doubt it ? Because I'm sterile for many years now . You laid someone else and want to dump it on me . You're a monster . And you are a hysterical piece of shit . I've always wanted to tell you this . You're a whore ! You lie all the time , like all whores ! I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the conversation is over . Don't cry , you pig . Don't cry , pig . A baby is what I most wanted in this world . You did right , Val . You're still young for having kids . I don't know what to do now . I quit my job , spent my savings and , thanks to him , I'm in deep debt . I paid the rent for months . Well , don't worry . What , what is going on here ? Can't you see ? She is leaving . What , you're clearing off ? My love , - I beg you , baby . - Leave her alone . If you walk out that door , I swear I'll kill you . Understand ? I'll kill you , you hear ? I am going to destroy you , bitch ! - You hear ? - I'll call the cops . This is fuckin ' shit ! Let's go , Val , we're out of here . I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll change , my love . Forgive me , my love . You can't go , my love . You won't get away from me , you hear ? Whore ! No one leaves me , you know ? No one leaves me , you bitch ! You're coming to my place until you get over that son of a bitch bastard . Val ? Hello . Val . Val , you can't go on like this . Val , you have to react . You look terrible . How long have you been here ? Oh , my baby ... I'll help you clean all this up . Look , I've brought food . Come on . Breaking off with Jaime nearly cost me my life . Seeing the depths of the pit , I want out and to see the light again . After several months without an orgasm my body was beginning to rouse . It was like waking from a long , eternal lethargy . I'm starving . I know what I will do to quench my appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I made a mistake . - No , it's here . Come in . Come in . - You're Val , right ? - Yes . You called for the interview . - I'm Cindy . One of the girls . - It's a pleasure . You'll be attended to right away . - Cristina . - Val , Valerie . Valerie ? A nice name . Let me have a look , please . Thanks . Have a seat , Val . - Where have you worked ? - In this ? Yes , of course . This is my first time . Interesting . What can you do ? Everything , as long as it's with a condom . That's fine . Go with Cindy . Use more make-up . Clients don't pay for what they have at home . - I think I found a job . - Tell me about it . For what company ? In a brothel . Come on , Val , that's not funny . I start tomorrow . - Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time waiting . Want to see the man of my life ? His name is Migue . He lives with my mother near Rio . I sent him there because his father is a bastard . I take all this for him , but I can't go on . I must whisper . These walls have ears . Come on , girls , let's dance . Are you going to behave ? Cindy . I'm Mar . I'm Stephanie . - What's your name , child ? - Laura . I'm Val . Val , I want you . - What do I have to do ? - That's up to you , but he's always high . He can not have full sex . A good hand job will make him happy . A two-hour hand job ? You know , you play a little , massages ... This is no school , Val . The client isn't going to gobble you up . You look beautiful . Hi . You're new , aren't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come here . - You have a special smell . - Really ? You like it ? - Let's go to bed . - No . Let's stay here . Fucking doesn't turn me on . Okay , relax , we'll see what can be done . Well , I'm from Seville . I work for a machine company that sells throughout Europe . Fuck ! Stop , girl , or I'll go crazy . Why the fuck did you stop ? Because you told me to . You pay no attention to me . Keep going , shit ! No one's ever done this to me before . - Did you go to the April fair ? - No . You know what's happened to me all of a sudden ? - I've fallen in love with you . - But we just met . That's right , love at first sight . Why don't we get into bed ? Okay , but just because I love you . What a nice ass you've got ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment I felt a strange feeling . The same as at 15 , with Eduard . I needed to know more , to learn from this world I just entered . What are you doing ? The first time is tough , I know . We have all cried the first time . But you get used to it , it becomes an exercise . - Are you okay ? - Of course I am . - Where's my money ? - Here you are . - How did it go ? - Fine , but a bit of a pain . You expected a cultured , interesting man with a pleasant conversation ? I remind you you're a whore . You look tired . Not at all , I'm delighted . What do clients like ? A bit of everything . Some want to tie you up , others stick things in you . You just gave me an idea . That handsome is he ! His name is Giovanni . He's Italian . The other one's a pig . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll be right out . Come on , you look divine . It was a pleasure to meet you . I hope you enjoyed it . What an intense life . I would like mine to be that way too . What's your name ? Valerie . I have a strange feeling that here , somehow , time stands still . You're just learning to be who you are . What about you ? You are the future of my past . And me , perhaps , the memory of your future . It's not a difficult job , just different . How can you say that ? I like to do it free , you know that . And I get paid , what else could I want ? - Have you ever been spanked ? - What ? Try it . You 'd be surprised . We have too many preconceptions . And those flowers ? A present from Pedro , a client . - They're pretty . - Yes . Still thinking of Jaime ? Not at all . I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Val . I've seen that look before . - Keep it . - No . Don't be silly . Yes , Cristina ? Okay , I'm on my way . It's Giovanni . Giovanni is different from all other clients I've met . I shivers when he touches me . He makes me go to the cosmos , see stars . I think I'm in love with him . Thank you . I live in Calabria because mama lives there . I spend most of the year travelling . - What ? - Your left eyebrow . - What's wrong with it ? - I like it . That uncombed hair . You know ? I communicate better with my body than with words . With a caress I describe things that make me feel alive . I'm scared , Giovanni , I like you too much . Your smell is irresistible . - What smell ? - The Mediterranean , freshness , life . I like you too much too . - Give me your phone number . - I can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss should pay you more . Will you call me again this week ? Do you want to know the answer ? Look , this proves that I will call you again . Save it for me , and take good care of it . I have to go . Your time's up . Although I 'd like to sleep with you ... What did you say ? Nothing , forget it . What about the money ? I'm a disaster . What if I pay you another hour ? This one is on me . Val , be very careful . Don't fall in love with him . It's sheer logic . It's impossible for a man who goes with whores to be loyal . Believe me . Valerie , you're beautiful . Your new job suits you . Although I'm jealous of the other men . When does your plane leave ? - In 3 hours . - Why , why don't you stay ? I have to go to Madrid . We could order a Coca-Cola and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m thirsty again . I guess you'll give me a good discount . A Coca-Cola and an opener , please . Don't you like it ? Of course I like this suite but I don't want to be your fiance , Pedro . Val , listen to me . I'll do whatever you want for you to love me . And I won't say a word while we're fucking . What I want is for you to marry me . Look , this is for you . Fuckin ' look at it . - You don't like it ? - No . I was given a similar one once . I can't accept it . Don't give me anything . And no flowers , I hate flowers . Pedro , you're pressing me . Go see some other girls . What are you saying ? I don't want others , I want you ! You're hurting me . I won't marry you . You're drunk . - I had better go . - Go , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what this room costs me ? I pay you , and you'll do as I say . You understand me ? Here's your fuckin ' money . Pick it up . Pick it the fuck up ! Stay there on all fours . Stay there on all fours . Yeah . - You're hurting me ? - Do you like it ? Now you'll ask me to spank you , like you've always done . You like that ? Bitch , you're a real bitch . You're hurting me . Please , Pedro . What are you complaining about ? What ? You chose to be a whore . You'll do as I say , in one way or another . Tell me you like this . No , please ! You like this ? I love you , Val . And you , what a view ? That night I understood , what grandma said , prostitution and marriage aren't that different . You become the property of someone else . And when they're like Jaime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he would kill me . There are many Pedros in this . Go , you're still in time . After , it's difficult to drop it . You could go to Rio and give my son an enormous kiss . Now go home . You look tired . I don't want to be alone . Hi , you've got a client , and there aren't that many Pedros . I'm sorry , I can't go . I haven't slept for nights . - And I have a date . - I'll go . You're going nowhere . Who's the date with ? You're committed to me . I 'd go if I were you . It's the Italian , your friend . - Giovanni ? - Yes , and his friend . Mae and you will go right now . Cheers ! - Hi . - Hi , darling . Come on , princess . I've finally convinced Giovanni , the ' macaroni ' , that you 'd be mine tonight . Come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you're here . What a pain of a whore ! I couldn't stop thinking about Giovanni . I couldn't believe he didn't pick me . I felt disgust while Alejandro fucked me . Cindy was right saying I should quit prostitution . I could still do that . But Cindy was trapped . She owed Cris a lot of money , and she was infatuated with her . She couldn't stand not having her son . What happened ? Cindy . She foll out the window . A suicide , we think . She got a call . Seems like her husband took the boy , but we know nothing more . Cindy would never leave her son . We buried her the next day , just the girls from the brothel . I was devastated . I can't stop thinking about Cindy . We're all sorry about Cindy , but life goes on , and the job that feeds you as well . I'm not going . Yes you are , darling . Hello ? Hello . - Hi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . - That's okay . - What's your name ? - Valerie . I'm Inigo . Delighted . Could you pick me up and put me on the bed ? I could do that but it takes me a great effort . Have no fear . I feel absolutely nothing . No , you don't need to undress me . The only place I feel anything is my neck . And my hands a bit . - You smell nice . - What do I smell of ? - Chocolate . - Chocolate ? Could you do me a favour ? Move your fingers . Come on , Valerie , Move the fingers of your hand . For you it's easy . I am incapable of moving a single finger . You don't know how many times , suddenly , I imagine me hands and my fingers start to move , and I get up off the chair and I start to run . I can tough the flowers , feel the velvet , and caress a woman as beautiful as you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you're still in time . After , it's difficult to drop it . Never give up anything you really long for because you'll regret it . Believe me . I know where you live . I'll go get you . Where are you going ? Where , huh ? I don't care what you say , I'm gone . I do care about what is said . Clear out ! Give me the bag ! You whore ! Go on , get out of my sight ! You're unbearable ! We always realize things when it's too late . Since the accident , whenever I see anyone , I give them advice . What advice ? To take advantage of their life every day , but truly . Live . You need to be alone . Enjoy life as much as you can . And I can touch grass , feel velvet . I slowly started to caress my body . I had finally discovered what road to follow . That of being myself . Although it was pouring rain , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment with who 'd always been by my side . What are you doing here ? I know I'm unpresentable . Congratulations ! - Are you okay ? - Better than ever . I wanted to thank you . For what ? For being my friend , for your advice . I always follow your advice . I've decided to leave the brothel . I'm so happy . I'll spend some time with Hassan . Won't you open your present ? It's beautiful ! It has no zipper . Now I don't have that problem . He helps me . This is Marcos . We met through an ad . - Hi , Marcos . - Hi . - I'm glad for you . - Come in and change . - No , I have to go . - What will you do now ? Live . I'm a promiscuous woman , yes , because I want to use sex as a means to find what everyone is looking for . Recognition , pleasure , self-esteem and , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to give me a name , go on , I don't mind . But you must know I'm really a mermaid , a dryad , simply a nymph . - Hi . - Hi . What ? Get home ? I want to fuck with you . I have no money . No matter . It's free . It's impossible for a man who goes with whores to be loyal . Valerie ... Live .

' I've been told to talk to you . ' Men in suits , people who don't use their real names . ' ' And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Gilroy's name mentioned . ' I asked you to keep me out of this . It's not up to me . If they make me go , I'll tell the truth , regardless . - The federation can help you . - I won't lie . - You can't use Gilroy's name . - Is that right ? James , you're the one who recruited this boy . Do you want that to be dragged into the open ? - BUZZING - Are you taping this ? It's a phone , Alec . Stop it . What the hell is the matter with you ? It's a text from Miriam , look . Don't make a martyr of yourself , James . Do what has to be done and disappear into your retirement . HE SIGHS When is it due ? Next month . And how is Richard ? Alan . Alan . Sorry . I 'd like to meet him . You probably wouldn't . Sorry ? Wrong accent , wrong university , wrong shoes ... This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I've escaped all of that , and then you pitch up , head of the truth police . I should have gone to Patagonia . I'm pleased you've found someone you love , who loves you , - and I 'd very much like to meet Alan . - Or Richard . - Stop it , please . Oh , you love the abuse . I love you . The abuse I can live without . Well , maybe you shouldn't have been off in the Congo reconciling a bunch of murderers when your wife was at home dying of cancer . Your mother had thrown me out . You should have tried harder . She didn't want me there . - I - wanted you there . I was doing it all on my own . How stupid are you ? I need your help . You only need to ask . Maria Roche , who you met ... I can't discuss the tribunal . I don't want you to discuss it . I want you to help her . Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I didn't ask her for specifics . Should I have ? I'll do whatever I can to help her . You'll listen to what she has to say ? I'll try to give her the truth about her brother , that's my job . Connor's obviously dead but not ... They need the body home . Yes . And they want those responsible to be named . Naturally . Do this for Maria . It'll mean a lot to her . And me . Can I drop you somewhere ? No , thanks . I'll call you . Thomas ... Come to bed . At the time , I believed the victim , Mr Lorimer , represented a legitimate target in that war . I deeply regret the hurt and pain caused to his family . I am very , very sorry and beg your forgiveness , Mrs Lorimer . Thank you . Mrs Lorimer , would you like to make your final address ? You ... You ... destroyed my life . My family . You murdered my man . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word "" sorry "" ! You killed my man ! Clear the chamber ! Clear the chamber . Remove her from the chamber . SHE SCREAMS SHE SHOUTS AND SCREAMS I just realised what it is we're doing here . Tell the chief constable that we need a larger security presence - in the chamber , will you ? - Of course . CHORAL SINGING Not long till Christine's wedding now . Two weeks , is it ? What is it , Johnny ? Connor Roche . The Truth Commission . - Am I called ? - No . But it could be trouble . Who for ? All of us . But you're the Minister now . Ricky , find out what that music is , will you ? So , who HAS been called ? We've found Michael Madden in Boston . Madden ? He was only a kid . He was there . And all his people are dead . He can accept responsibility and go back to the States as if nothing had happened . Neither you nor I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve been instructed to protect you , to make sure the right things are said . You mean you're protecting yourself ! Francis , keep your voice down . You're not planning some kind of a putsch , are you , Johnny ? All I'm trying to do is to keep your name out of it . You can not appear before that commission . Just admitting you were there would be the end of you . The end of all of us . O Magnum Mysterium , Tomas Luis de Victoria , 1572 . I won't have that modern script . LAUGHTER I don't like him calling me Frankie . - And this bloody waistcoat . - You look great . I look like a clown . It's what Christine wants . We agreed . - Hey , Da , are you ready ? - - We want to show you something . - They're in high spirits . INDISTINCT COMMENTS AND LAUGHTER What do you think , Frankie ? "" Communities Minster shows "" he hasn't forgotten his roots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . No , neither do I . Come on , Da . We're just pulling your leg . I don't see the fucking joke . Christine , take the boys for a drink . And get rid of that thing . Francis ... What is wrong with me , Catherine ? Only you know the answer to that . I better apologise . - NEWS : - ' Henry Stanfield , ' the recently appointed Truth Commissioner for Northern Ireland , ' has called for stronger security measures ' at the commission's hearings . ' It follows an incident today ' when the widow of murdered Edward Lorimer violently attacked ' one of those who admitted to her husband's murder . ' Mrs Lorimer launched herself on him after listening to his apology . ' Mr Stanfield said the incident was regrettable ' but perhaps understandable , ' given the years of suffering ' endured by many of the victims ' families ' who are appearing at the commission . ' ' Krystal's phone . ' Um ... May I speak with Krystal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For how long ? ' Who's calling ? ' Thomas Tatless . ' She won't be back any time soon . Do you have a message ? ' No . Um ... No , thank you . May I join you ? No . I asked you not to meddle in this process , and you completely ignored me . And I know you are using Laura . Come on , Henry . She was hardly going to sleep with you . DRINK POURS What is it you are advising the PM on ? Stability in the institutions , keeping an eye on the long-term objective , peace . Usefully vague . And is she heeding your advice ? So , how do you think the commission is going ? Apart from yesterday's incident , not bad . Unfortunate , that . Yes . The case of Connor Roche is soon to come before you . The Roches have asked you to expand the witness list . Fully within the terms of my remit . No-one is disputing that . Good . Did you tell Laura that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind ? God , Henry . You can't account for every casual remark . - I'll take that as a yes . - When is your daughter's baby due by the way ? I understand she and Maria Roche know one another . What's so special about Francis Gilroy ? He is not responsible for Connor Roche's disappearance . Yes , so Sinn Fein said . Do you take their word on that ? We all want the Roches to have closure . It's such a stupid word , that , don't you think ? So the man who actually pulled the trigger will attend the commission but it would be best if that were the end of it . What is it you don't want the world to know , Jake ? Anything that might destabilise the extremely hard-won peace . The Roches deserve the truth . The truth is Gilroy may have been an idiot once but compared to most of them he's Mahatma Gandhi . The truth is he's one of the reasons most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is none of us much fancies the alternative . Is that your advice ? You have a friend named Krystal . Someone paid her to set you up but because my interest is stability in the institutions I intervened . - Intervened ? - She works here illegally . She has a six-year-old son . She wasn't difficult to persuade . - Where is she ? - That ... You don't need to know . If she contacts you again or refers to these again she'll be deported . Did you do this , Jake ? With Gilroy's handlers . They are keen to make a point . Well , it'll take more than a few embarrassing photographs to stop this commission . Exactly what I told them , which is why we're not sitting here watching the live version of these on YouTube . Believe it or not , Henry , I am trying to save lives , not just protect reputations . But do try to be a little more careful with what passes for your sex life . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RINGS - Laura . - ' Some news . The police have had a change of heart . ' They've offered up ex DI James Fenton though they're denying - ' he recruited Connor Roche . ' - And Gilroy ? ' They've named the man they say shot Connor . ' And it's not Francis Gilroy ? ' Someone called Michael Madden . Shall I tell the Roches ? ' No . Not yet . - You see much of Jake ? - ' He phoned . ' He said you and he had had a drink together . - ' He 'd forgotten how much he enjoyed your company . ' - That was kind of him . - ' I was quite jealous . ' - Good night , Laura . - Mr Stanfield ? - Sir . - It's all right , Beckett . Stay where you are . - My name is Fenton . - Yes , I know who you are . - What do you want ? - Strike me from the list ? That's not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So tell the truth . They're not going to let me tell the truth . They 'd destroy me first . Please , Mr Stanfield . We all have to make our own choices , Mr Fenton . This is not my choice . I heard shots . I ran from the house . Seamus was lying there in the cold . Blood was pouring from his forehead . Two members of the UDA were convicted of his murder ... .. but released after the Good Friday Agreement . My family and I would like to hear what they have to say . Thank you , Mrs Benson . Jake , you told me Krystal was out of the equation and now she shows up at the tribunal . So what is this ? Am I fighting on two fronts here ? Because if you think this is the way to spare Gilroy's blushes , trust me , I'll make it a lot worse for him and for all of you than a few photos of me making a bloody fool of myself . Call me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I was in at the tribunal . If you don't mind me saying , you seem to be in a bit of a state . I'm not sure what was going on in there but I don't want my brother's hearing to be like that . How do you know Anna Connelly , the Sinn Fein lawyer ? She came into the chamber just now with some other woman . I've met a lot of lawyers since I came here . Do you like the truth , Truth Commissioner ? - Truth is rarely pure and ... - And never simple . Yeah , I know . - But it's what gets me out of bed at the morning . - Yes , I can see . I'll make sure Anna Connelly will not humiliate my family even if you won't . I'll see to it that she won't . It's Henry Stanfield . I 'd like to speak to Francis Gilroy . TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT So , Michael , I was very sorry to hear about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do what we tell you , you'll be back in Boston before you know it . The salmon are back . That was a filthy pond when I was a boy . Do you know this woman ? - No . - She turned up at the commission yesterday - with your Ms Connelly . - And ? - No , I didn't think you knew . - This is not my doing . I'm sorry . Who's Madden ? - He's nobody . He was a boy . - So why him ? - He was there . And did he kill Connor ? The Roches want a name . A guilty man . - That's what you promised them , isn't it ? - They seem to want you . Those photographs are for Jake Marston's benefit . - What does that mean ? - They make it seem like they're serious about protecting me . - A man Dublin and London could deal with . - And ? Some of my colleagues are protecting themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop them ? - I won't name names . I think you'll let Madden take the rap because it's the least worst option for you . I didn't kill Connor Roche , but you drag me before the commission , it'll be as if I did . No-one will benefit except those who replace me . How many times in how many countries have I heard that speech ? You must do what you have to do , Mr Stanfield . I always knew my job was a poisoned chalice . What about yours ? CAR ENGINE STARTS - Interesting . - He's old school . He won't be pleased about the photographs . Send Mr Stanfield the other images . MOBILE PHONE BEEPS - ' Dad . ' - Emma . - ' Dad , what's it ? What's wrong ? ' - I'm sorry to wake you . - ' No , no , I was ... What's wrong ? ' I ... I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice . Make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . I'm fine . ' - Right . - Emma ? - ' What is it , Dad ? ' It's ... nothing . Goodnight . Prime Minister , I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation . I have a daughter who's moved here . She's pregnant , vulnerable . I can not guarantee her safety . I realise your personal investment in this . Yes , you made it very plain . This is to be your legacy . Just let me try to explain . No , of course not . No , I haven't . Not yet . Yes . All right . All right . PHONE RINGS Yes , what is it ? - Henry , are you all right ? - What is it , Laura ? I'm sorry to pressure you but you need to make a decision on Gilroy . You need to know now ? Yes , the Roche case has been moved forward to Thursday . Hello . Take Gilroy off the list . Let's see what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Yes . OK . Sleep well . It's the right choice . Believe me . KNOCK ON DOOR - Is everything all right ? Emma ? - She's fine . There's a guard at the house . I know the men on duty . Very discreet . She's in good hands . I was told to give this to you . It was left at the commission for you . - Can I offer you a drink ? - Thank you . But I 'd better get back . - Good night , sir . - Goodnight . When we get there stay close to me . Keep your head up and look straight ahead . Keep everything for the commission . And remember , we're here for you , shoulder to shoulder . Maria Roche wants me to call the man responsible for Connor's death before the tribunal . Yes . I can't give the Roches what they want . Why not ? Threats have been made . Threats ? What kind of threats ? They've made it plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gilroy ? The Minister ? - You have to call him . - Emma ... I'm not risking you or my grandchild for a truth commission , - not even this truth commission . - See this as an opportunity , Dad . A chance to do something that matters for those you say matter to you . I won't make pointless grand gestures . OK , so when the truth doesn't suit you , it's a pointless grand gesture . You owe this to me . You owe it to my mum . And if you ever , ever hope to see him , you owe it to your grandchild . Do not pass up on this chance . There won't be another . Michael and I have been working on the events that led to the unfortunate death of Connor Roche . Michael ? Connor was passing information about Republicans to the police . He 'd been seen with the Special Branch so he was to be taken over the border and questioned about it . I drove the car for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no-one heard him . He freely admitted what he had been doing . It was decided to set up a press conference where he 'd describe how he was recruited by the police and passed information . But early next morning , he somehow managed to climb out a window . I was supposed to be watching him . I had a gun . I panicked , I chased after him into the woods . I shouted after him that he 'd get me in big trouble , not to be stupid . All of a sudden , he was on top of me , punching and kicking me . I was on the ground . I tried to push him off . But he gets hold of the gun ... He was trying to wrestle it off me . And then ... - I don't know how ... - GUNSHOT ECHOES .. but the gun went off . And he stopped moving . It was a terrible accident . I'm sorry for what happened to Connor . I'm truly sorry . Very good , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , Anna ? I had no idea they 'd put so much pressure on you not to call Gilroy . I'm sorry if I ... Where's Francis Gilroy ? They sent him instead . Sure , he was only a child himself . - ( They're not sending Francis Gilroy . - What's going on ? ) I 'd ask everyone to stand in silent memory of all those who lost their lives in the conflict . Thank you . I'll begin by asking Maria Roche if she would tell us about the events leading up to her brother Connor's disappearance . When Connor disappeared , he was 15 years old . It was a Thursday night . He said he was going down to the boxing club . He didn't come home . When another day passed , we went to the police . They told us they believed he 'd been abducted by the IRA . A few days later , word reached us . A neighbour said that Connor had been supplying information to the police and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape . How could Connor work for the police ? What did he know about anything ? Years went by and nobody was able or willing to tell us anything . It was as if he never existed . But we have a right to know , to have his body back where he belongs . Thank you , Miss Roche . The commission calls James Fenton . Please state your name and your connection with the case . James Fenton , Detective Inspector . Special Branch , RUC . Retired . When did you first encounter Connor Roche ? I can't remember the exact date , but towards the end of January 1992 . Connor was suspected of involvement in petty crime , making a nuisance of himself . So we picked him up . He denied any wrongdoing . We had no evidence , so we ... We gave him a word of warning and sent him on his way . And when did you hear he was missing ? May 13th . His mother came to the station . No trace of Connor was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abducted by the IRA . And do you know the identity of those who abducted Connor ? No . Is there anything further you might be able to add , Mr Fenton ? I 'd like you to think carefully before you answer . I'm afraid not , no . A moment , Mr Fenton . I think Miss Roche has some questions . I want to play a recording relevant to the case . We had no prior knowledge of this . Miss Roche ... is this recording of legitimate concern to this hearing ? It is . It was given to me by someone involved in Connor's abduction . Proceed . My mother has identified this as Connor's voice . - TAPE : - ' Name ? ' Connor Roche . ' If you ever want to see your mother again , ' you're going to tell me who , when , ' where , how often and why . ' Am I clear ? ' Why did you do it ? ' They said they 'd get me shot if I didn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? ' Twice a week . ' What were their names ? ' Inspector Fenton . ' And DS Briggs . ' Where did you meet them ? ' They 'd pick me up in Belfast and we 'd drive . ' And ? ' If I didn't give them information , they said they 'd drop me ' where people would be waiting to give me a head job . ' Did they pay you ? - ' TEARFULLY : - I didn't do it for money . ' What did you do it for ? ' SOBBING ON TAPE ' Cos I was scared . ' They kept saying what would happen if I didn't help them . ' I didn't do it for money . ' I'm telling the truth . ' Can I go home now ? ' SNIFFLING ON TAPE ' Can I go home now ? ! ' Mr Fenton , isn't it true that Connor was working for you ? I didn't say any of those things to Connor . Is it true that Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect lives . So you used Connor to gather that information ? We met him from time to time , in the same way we met many people . How many times did you meet him ? Perhaps half a dozen . I can't remember exactly . And you paid him ? Small amounts . Not very much . So what are we talking about ? Five or ten pounds ? More ? I think it was mostly about ? 10 . He just wanted to talk as much as anything . We were like ... .. friends . Connor said he was forced to supply information . No-one threatened him or said that he was going to be shot . So why do think he said those things ? He was frightened . He was just telling them what they wanted to hear . Mr Fenton , you were aware of Connor's age ? Look , I don't think you understand what we were having to deal with . - I understand that you were dealing with a child . - Miss Roche ... Please let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren't there , if you hadn't lived through it ... you can't understand what it was like . Things were falling apart . When you reported for duty , you never knew what you might be having to deal with . Police officers were handed caseloads of 200 , 250 murders . Working on them for a couple of months before they themselves were murdered . We were in a war . Things happened that ... .. that shouldn't happen . I want to say that I regret ... .. deeply what happened . I'm very sorry . Thank you for that . But you were aware of the fate of so-called informers , weren't you ? Yes . Did he supply you with any information you considered useful ? No . So a boy lost his life supplying meaningless information in exchange for petty cash ? No further questions . I didn't kill Connor . I'm not the person who killed him . Thank you , Mr Fenton . There will be a five minute recess . Did you know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't you say ? Honestly ? Because I couldn't be sure who you might tell . MAN RETCHING AND COUGHING TOILET FLUSHES - TANNOY : - ' Michael Madden to the Commission Chamber , please . ' It wasn't your fault . That's what happens when you don't stick to the script . We've had enough surprises for one day , so just keep it nice and simple . The commission calls Michael Madden . Would you please state your name and your connection to the case ? My name's Michael Madden . Mr Madden ? My name is Michael Madden . I joined the IRA when I was 17 . Made me feel big . But I wasn't big . I was an idiot . A message boy . In May 1992 ... I drove Connor and two volunteers to a farm across the border , in County Monaghan . Connor was dragged into the house and tied to a chair . And one of the men began to beat him . Badly . HE GASPS HE SOBS Phone calls were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape of him admitting what he 'd done . He was told after he 'd made the tape he 'd make a press statement . And then it would all be over . A couple of hours later , another man arrived from Belfast . When he saw the state that Connor was in , there was a real bust-up with the interrogator , who was shouting we were all soft in Belfast and too interested in looking good to get our hands dirty . Connor was to be kept for a couple of days until he mended up and could go back for the press conference . But some time around dawn , he escaped . The commander was screaming at us to find him . I was supposed to be keeping watch so I panicked . I ran into the woods . But Connor jumped me . He was wild . Kicking and punching . He was strong . He got on top of me . Pinning me down . But then ... .. there was a shot . Connor stopped struggling . He collapsed on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wasn't meant to happen . The two senior men were standing there ... .. and one had a gun . Michael ... tell us now who killed Connor . Francis Gilroy killed Connor . Please remain calm . Order , please . Order in the chamber . Order ! Call Francis Gilroy . HE MOUTHS The commission calls Francis Gilroy . PHONE RINGS Anna , how did it go ? Right . He actually named Francis ? I'll call you back . Frankie ! REPORTERS CLAMOUR Listen carefully . You've got to get out of the house . Get Alan to take you ... ' No , stop . We're not in the house , Dad . We're at the hospital . - ' The baby came early . ' - What ? - ' I've had the baby . ' - Where are you ? ' The Ulster Hospital . ' That's good . That's very good . Don't move from there . ' Relax , Dad . I'm not moving . ' OK . OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot him ? But you did order his abduction ? And you know who did shoot him ? But you won't say who . Well , whoever pulled the trigger , Roche had it coming . It was a war . Pull yourself together . Move on . Christine wants me to look at seating plans . DOOR OPENS And there's someone here to talk to you . Francis . You know why I'm here . You're here because you think this is your moment . I'm here to rescue your politically embarrassing situation . And because you think I won't tell Stanfield - it was you shot Roche . - That'll hardly save you . - Might save the party . - It's too late now . Oh . So , what's it to be ? Back to all-out war ? Let's just say we'll put a little more backbone into the struggle . Backbone ? ! Like shooting 15-year-old boys ? He was an informer . Whereas you're not , Francis . It's not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want Madden left out of it . Always the hero , Francis . Madden wasn't to know . Useless prick couldn't even get a simple confession right . It was only luck he named you and not me . Yeah , lucky , that ( ! ) I can make this difficult for you . Let him go . You go quietly , I'll see to it Madden goes unharmed . Your statement's been written . ' Yes ? ' Have you got him ? ' We got him . ' Well done . Now let him go . Can I ask why ? ' Because I say so . ' Is that understood ? ' Understood . ' Satisfied ? Be ready in an hour . He's beautiful . Tom . Hmm . Your grandfather's name . How was it today ? Gilroy ? I don't think Maria and her family got what they wanted . You called Gilroy after all ? I knew you 'd help . Would you like to hold him ? PHONE RINGS Oh , sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congratulations ! Becky told me the good news , Grandad . You don't think I had anything to do with Madden's performance ? Not I . Others are less sure . So , what now ? Despite today's catastrophe , amazingly , the feeling is it was a minor setback . Or a minor triumph . Oh , Henry . You get to call Gilroy . He'll resign , they'll replace him with someone less able and more belligerent . All because the Roches had to have the truth . - The truth is Gilroy is guilty . - Gilroy is not guilty . - I pleaded with you not to call him . - Why would Madden lie ? Thought he was telling the truth . - What ? - Who was it convinced the Roches that Gilroy shot Connor ? Tried to blackmail you , forced Madden to take the rap . Rafferty isn't protecting Gilroy , he's protecting himself . He'll be bossing it from here on in . New Sinn Fein minister . I've already told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of this . No , you're not washing your hands of this one , Henry . All sides are agreed . It was entirely my fault for letting Rafferty lead me by the nose . Stanfield is still the best man for the job . PM , pathological optimist , wants you to put this all behind you . I wouldn't disappoint her a second time . Following the serious revelations concerning a member of the power-sharing executive , both the Taoiseach and I are here tonight to reaffirm our commitment to the Truth Commission . And to offer our thanks to Henry Stanfield who hasn't shrunk from his task in doing what is necessary , however painful or politically challenging , in offering the truth to a community which has too long waited for answers . For those who have inflicted pain , for those who have endured pain , the truth can , and will , lead to healing , and a lasting peace . Thank you . APPLAUSE CAR HORN BEEPING No , wait . Mr Stanfield , do you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to say to me ? EXPLOSION From now on , you might think twice about digging up a past that you don't understand and that doesn't concern you . Like Gilroy ? Unfortunately , Francis had to be got rid of so we got you to do it for us . Nothing personal , you understand . I'll not give up ! ' In the light of recent accusations made before the Truth Commission , ' it's with a heavy heart that ' I have decided to stand down from my position as Minister ' in a government which I fought long and hard to bring into being . ' This has been an extremely difficult decision . ' And though I completely reject the accusations made , ' the credibility of our party is , and always has been , paramount . ' So I stand aside , confident that those who replace me ' will not waver in the struggle for a united Ireland , ' without which , this country can never fully be at peace . - ' REPORTER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilroy ? ' ' Recent weeks have shown that there are those with the courage and common humanity to face the consequence of their actions . ' The bombing of the Commission has shown that there are those ' who feel threatened by that courage ' and will do all in their power to suppress the truth . ' But the Commission will continue its pursuit of the truth , ' however inconvenient , not because we want to dwell in the past , ' but so that our children and grandchildren ' will be free of the past . ' Thank you . '

( Joy ) It's lovely . - It's like Caribbean decorators ' gear . - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one in the bedroom ? - Brass's carpet , love . - A brass's carpet ? - Yeah . ( Joy ) I think it's smashing . Tom , shall we have another baby ? What , have all that aggravation and screeching all night , love ? - What aggravation ? - Well , it was murder , wasn't it , love ? Aww , I 'd love a little girl . I 'd call her Debbie . Do you like that name ? - Debbie ? Yeah , it's all right , in n it ? - Yeah . I think it's smashing . I can just see her now , tottering down the road in a little pink frock with all her bum showing . There you are , Jenny . ( Joy ) You seen this in the paper ? Some fella did a smash and grab . He got away with ? 50,000 worth of jewels . Why don't you go up west again ? Here , have a look . Some people have got more chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just can't do that on your own . He's not a burglar , the geezer . You need a ringer . You need , like , two-handed , you need a ... Well , you need money . You got ta have money to do something like that . Well , why don't you ask Jim and Bunter to lend you some ? Jim and Bunter wouldn't give me anything , Joy . Nobody would give me anything . What have I ever give to anybody ? People , if you've got no dough , you're nobody . You've got no money , people don't want to know you . - You got money , you're Jack the lad . - Look at my knees . I paint my toenails then I forget to wash my knees . I du n no know what's wrong with me . Here , did you hear about that Jimmy Baxter ? He got off . ( Laughs ) Do you know how he got out of that , love ? It cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the flying squad , ? 200 . - Well , what do you mean ? - He give it to him . He give it to him so as not to give evidence . - Ain't you ever heard of that , Joy ? - Well , I have , yeah . Do you know last time I got nicked , I sent you round to Lennie to borrow money ? - Yeah . - The money wasn't for you , Joy . If Lennie had given me the money , I would never have done that last lot of jail . Well , I didn't know that . You didn't tell me . The only straight policeman you'll ever see is possibly ... the top man in England or the one's on the zebra crossings . All the other one's , with their Moody Blue raincoats and their tough boots , they're all bent , love . The lot . From start to bottom . Bent . They're bent on traffic of fences . You got money , they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s like anything . People like stockbrokers and all those people in official positions , or in a position to handle the public's money , they're all thieves . All the MPs , everybody . But they make laws so they can't get nicked . Not like us . We're the only people who get nicked when we do anything . Screws are the same as cozzers . If I 'd had a tenner a week to give a screw , I could've had a bottle of whisky every week . The only thing you can't get in there is a broad cos it's too big . That's all . Everybody's bent , Joy . It's like this flat . We had to give a few quid to get this flat . Plenty of people on the housing list can't get a flat cos they've got no money . Everybody's bent . - Hello , Mr Jacks . - You're early . Had a good week , then ? - Yeah . How are you today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . - Hello . - Say hello . - Hello . - He likes you . - He liked me last time , didn't he ? Oh , that's quite good . That's very good . Don't you fancy her ? Yeah . They wouldn't be allowed now to do a picture like that in Germany . - Why's that ? - Well , they just passed a law , you see . You can't ... If you're gon na expose your breasts in a photograph , you see , you've either got to see both of them or none of them . - Really ? - Yeah . None of this business . You can't have one out and one in . You either have them both out or none . - Why's that ? - I don't know . ( MrJacks ) I like the patter . "" Man is for woman made and a woman made for man . "" - They're right , ain't they ? - I bet she's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you tell ? She ... I like her . What do you reckon ? Yeah , she's quite nice . She's got a bit too much make-up on for me . I think that's rather good , you see . Poking them either side of the ... - ( Laughs ) - ... of the wooden doings . - Yeah , I suppose that's quite artistic . - Yeah . Mmh . I like that , actually . What do you reckon ? Mmh . It's quite nice . Yeah . How would you like to have a bit of wood , anyway ? ( Laughs ) Oh , I think she's repulsive . Look at that face . ( MrJacks ) Out the way . Out the way . ( MrJacks ) That's the one . ( Joy ) Oh , no , she hasn't got much . ( Joy ) I mean , I would've thought you liked them with , erm , you know ... ( MrJacks ) Well , yeah , I do . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MrJacks ) It's a landmark in the dark . - ( JoyLaughs ) ( Joy ) What do you like about her , then ? ( MrJacks ) Well , she looks in need of it , you see ? Oh ! Oh , you are cheeky , aren't you ? ( Joylaughs ) You know , what I 'd really like is a nice flat in Chelsea . Have you got any ? Have I got any ? Well , I might be able to put you onto one . Ooh , pardon . I might . Yeah , well , it sounds a bit more classy than this . Sounds a bit poxy , a flat in Wandsworth , doesn't it ? - Where have you been , Joy ? - I went to pay the rent . - You went to pay the rent ? - That's what I said . - You've been four hours paying the rent ! - Don't do that ! Don't start all that ! Now , don't start all that . Has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Eh ? I haven't seen one . What do you mean , has he got a couch ? You know what I mean ! Where's my tools ? - I haven't seen your tools ! - I want ' em ! - Now , don't you start ! Don't ! - Sit down ! I want my tools ! Don't start that with me . I've had just about enough of you . You're always having a go at me ! I come in this house , I do everything I can . I'm not your slave ! I'm not your ... - ( Screams ) - Now get ! Now get down there ! - You gon na get down there ? - Yes , I am ! I am ! Don't touch me ! - Get down there , then ! - ( Sobs ) - Let me go ! Don't hit me again , please ! - Let you go ? ( Sobs ) ( Tom ) Look , I'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! - Don't go running to your old woman . - Do you know what you've done ? - What have I done ? - You've hit me . You've hit me and ... - Look , I didn't mean to hit you . - You've hit me and I might be pregnant . - That's it . That's the finish . - I told you never to lend ' em , Joy . ( Joy ) ' You see , he won't go . He won't leave me . ' And I can't get rid of him unless he gets nicked . ' If only I had a car , I 'd drive off and find a place ' where there are only men and a few glamour girls ' and flashy cars and big hotels . ' But then I 'd muck myself up talking . ' Cos I always get ballsed up talking to the upper classes . ' Whoever heard of girls like me making it ? ' How can I go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same anymore . ' Oh , I can't stick this sort of security . ' I can't abear the thought of all these women doing the same things , ' you know , mopping down their steps , doing their ironing , ' changing their babies , doing their shopping . ' Then there's another side of life where the husband and wife are very happy . ' They don't have to dabble in what it's like with other people . ' If I leave Tom , I 'd be frightened . ' Cos I'm so frightened of being on my own . ' ( Joy ) Can I have a cup of tea , please ? ( Menchat ) ( Joy ) ' I suppose my life's over . ' Well , you only get one chance . ' I got a great pain in my heart yesterday . ' I really wanted to gas myself . ' I've never felt that desperate before . ' Then again , you read all this stuff in the papers . ' You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locked up , and all the rest . ' Well , I don't want my little Jonny , I don't want him to be a result of that . ' You know , the result of a broken home . Cos that would be terrible . ' And that's why I'm trying . That's why ... ' If I could find a bloke tomorrow ' who loved Jonny as much as he loved me ... ' ... well , I 'd go with him like a shot . ' Cos all you need is a man ' and a baby ... ' ... and a couple of nice rooms to live in . ' When you think of it , that's all it comes down to . ' ( TV ) ' ... but generally dry . There could be the odd showers ... ' Where's Jonny ? I don't know . I thought he was with you . ( Joy ) I told you I wasn't taking him with me . Well , I ain't your baby minder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you seen Jenny anywhere ' ? No , I haven't , love . I've had her in for an hour , give her tea and everything . - ( Joy ) Oh . - Don't know where he can be . It's half past seven , nearly , you know ? Shh , love ! He might be down the waste ground down there . There's a load of kids playing . Jonny ! Oh , God . Jonny , are you ' m there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you in there ? ( @knocks_on_door ) Jonny ' ? Oh , no . Jonny ! ( Sighs ) Jenny , are you over there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you ' m there ' ? Jonny ! 0h , my God ! ( Sob ) Oh . Jonny . Jonny . ! Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , my baby ! Oh , my baby ! Oh ! Mummy thought , I thought I 'd lost you for ever and ever and ever . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? - Yeah , we'll go now . ( Sighs ) That's difficult . I don't know cos I dream about it a lot , but I really don't know , if it came to it , I suppose it's all big dreams , really . But if anything happened to little Jonny , I suppose I 'd become a brass . Oh , is there any perfect life ? I don't think there is , really . People go on about how happy they are and what they got and what a lovely home they've got and they've got a new telly and they've got new fitted carpet in the lounge . And I sit there and I think ... And I go on about it myself . I'm always saying , "" Oh , I want this and I want that . "" But when you come down to it , I don't think there is a perfect life , really . You just got ta make do with what you've got and be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even talk about it . I always think of Dave . Cos he ... he brought out something that was inside me that I never knew was there . I ... You know , he was marvellous . I think about him all the time . If I ... If I listen to a record or something . It just ... You know , I just can't imagine he's not here with me , cos it was so marvellous . And it's terrible if you love someone . Why should they be taken away from you ? But I just think of the time when we're gon na be together again . And I hope it's not too long . Cos he was so different to Tom . He was soft and warm and ... It was ... It was fantastic . With Tom , he just , he's insensitive . He doesn't ... He never asks me if I'm all right or ... You know , he thinks that money is everything . But with Dave , it was fantastic .

Agent Douglas will be participating in the party operation this evening . The mission of this task force is to capture and incarcerate this man , Reginald Bailey : street name G . According to our sources , he is responsible for the recent surge of violence in Compton . Hopefully , he will lead us to this man , Tito Costa , under-boss to older brother Emile Costa . There are no images available of Emile Costa . We know he's the capo of a Mexican cartel , responsible for 70% of the cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the worst of them all ... is this piece of work . 20-year veteran detective Joseph Coleman , Costa's eyes and ears on the street . Now , this party is being held at our request by one Dickie Marshall . The basketball player ? Nigga is tall . Settle down . A few months ago , Dickie Marshall stepped in shit , and we cut him some slack . He is returning the favor by hosting this party tonight and inviting some of his underworld friends , especially the one's to which he still has ties in Compton . So , sir , what is the purpose of this party ? To get the Costa brothers , Reginald Bailey , or Joseph Coleman ? I'm glad you asked that question . This party is your point of insertion into the L.A . criminal underworld . Agent Douglas , you will meet Reginald Bailey . You will win his confidence .

"" George : That's it . I'll get you back . George : Annie . No , no ! One storm in that tent will end it here for all of us . Ruth : Mr . Mullen agreed to put her in a larger cell . Don't mind if she doesn't talk . She just sews and sews . I heard you singing . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wrote it ? That's something I want to do . - Learn to write . - You will mail it for me ? This is William Sellor . I told you about him . He has some dresses he wants you to sew . Costumes . For a play based on an opera . Are you sure she can do this ? I can't afford to have it fail . It took two weeks to get the cloth . Ruth : She's an artist . Look at her work . Here . Yes , it's real nice . It is outstanding . - But ... - But what ? I've done a few sketches ... to inspire you . Here are the measurements for Lucia . Both dresses are for her . Are you familiar with the story of Lucia ? - No . - It's a wonderful story ... about a young girl named Lucia . She falls madly in love with a young man . Woman : Hello ! Hey . It's the Treeces . Welcome . Simon : Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if you folks would come over Sunday next . We haven't had a chance to welcome you , Mrs . Herron . We don't have time for parties . - Don't mind him , Mrs . Treece . - Hope you'll perform for us . With pleasure . We miss seeing you at the church . Well , I've been anxious to finish the house . Not working on Sundays , I hope . - Would you like some tea ? - No , thank you . We're on our way to the fort , actually . Simon , we'll be picking up some supplies before the weather changes , back in a couple of days . Is there anything you need ? No . It must be very awkward here for you , alone with these two young men . No , we manage very well . You have a lot of work to do before the snow flies . Well , now , here's something I haven't seen before . A fireplace open on both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll heat four rooms . Mr . Treece : Nothing but a fire hazard . You're sleeping out here ? You must be freezing . You're welcome to sleep at our place , George . Well , it's not so bad . I've built a shelter . I've got that bear rug you gave me . You're building too close to the creek . This whole area floods in the spring . Hup ! We didn't need his help , or anyone else's . He's hoping we'll fail so he can take it over . Or he'll marry his daughter off to George . You 'd be daft enough to do it , huh ? - You borrowed the house , Simon . - I paid him in furs . He isn't so smart . Lots of places have fireplaces , open like this . Every house in Orkney . Annie : That Jenny does have her eye on you , George . Pure and simple . Nothing's pure , and never simple . ( peoplechatter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night . Sir ? Annie gave me this to mail . I never mailed anything . So I thought I should give it to you . Thank you , Ruth . I'll take care of it . Annie's voice : "" Dear Sadie , I'm in terrible trouble .

Mullen , the fort headquarters , will find you a place to stay . Yours affectionately , Annie . "" It says nothing . It says she's keeping a great deal to herself . I'll post the letter .

Agnes Craig , a married woman . A lover . You have a haunting voice . No wonder they miss you at church . There was not much to sing about till you came , Annie . I thank God every night that you're here . You've been such a blessing . - ( Anniesighs ) - I 'd better go back and make supper . Annie ... if you were my wife ... I would worship you . Mullen's voice : A month has passed , and no light has been shed on the young woman's true identity , nor on the location of her homestead . Her youth and open demeanor invite sympathy . But in my experience , judging a woman from her parents is always a mistake . I think I 'd better give this to you . Thank you . Look at this . "" Sadie Johnson ... deceased . "" Oh dear . - You want to tell her ? - I 'd be wise not to . For one thing , she's writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you mean . A man in your position should always tell the truth , but not all truths need be told . Exactly . She has a bold script , don't you think ? Yes . Yes , a fascinating lass , that one .

Treece : Well done . Bravo . - What confidence . - Extraordinary . You've got a real talent there , lad . Where did you learn to sing like that ? Well , I was raised by my father's sister , a schoolteacher . Simon was not so lucky . He was raised by my mother's cousin , a woodsman . I can sing a tune ... but you might not like it much . I wanted to go on at school . But Simon was impatient to take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . - You can sing at my church . - No , he can't . We're leaving now . Get your coat . No , son .

I wouldn't think of traveling so late . - I'm staying . - Afraid of the wolves , Reverend ? God will protect you . I hope you'll come back soon , Mrs . Herron . Maybe I can't read or write ... but I can do a day's work , - and not whine about it . - We're going , Simon . I just wanted to thank you for the best meal I've ever had , and for your hospitality . - God bless you all . - He 'd be dead if it weren't for me . - 1 00 times over . - We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bony ass .

Let's get it nice and warm in here first . Take everything off now . Just sit down and -- I'll undress for you . You'll like it . I'll take off everything . Just sit there .

Don't ! - Annie . - Go away , George . - Annie , please . - Go now . Please , go . ( Simongroans ) George : Christ . Mullen : Thank you , Donnely . I've had a response from my inquiries . - A Reverend McBain . - Have they found George ? He says he arranged the marriage between you and Mr . Herron . Seems to know a great deal . He's very concerned about you . And ... he says that this has been a horrible mistake . Why did you come here ? Have you ever looked into a dead man's eyes ? No , not a dead man's . A dead child's . My daughter ... just a few days old . - I'm sorry . - I blame myself . But that doesn't make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forever . Heeyah ! Annie , do you remember me ? Reverend McBain , of course . Poor wee child . We've gone over every idea . Then we got word you were here . - Have you seen George ? - He's at the Treeces ' . He's distraught and confused ... as I'm sure you are . Annie ... George told us what happened . I think not , Reverend . I think not . What have you got on , there ? I'm going to marry the devil . Tell George not to lie unless he's absolutely certain the truth will never be discovered . Aye , we'll make some arrangements , sir . Her mother was a Catholic , but her father was a Scot . Make him go away , Mr . Mullen ! Nobody's accusing her of anything . You weren't there , Reverend ! You don't know ! Will you just listen to me ? Calm down , Reverend . This is going nowhere . - ( Anniehums ) - Donnely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He's a member of my congregation . - He swore it is truthful . - Either she's mad ... Am I wicked or insane ? Annie : George !

No ! - Annie : George ! - I should do the same to you ! Annie : He's sick from the drink . He's fallen asleep . He's sorry . I'm sure he'll apologize . He can apologize to Satan , for all I care .

Simon : Get away from us ! - Leave us alone ! - You're not thinking , son . Hey ! Now you have one last chance to make this right . You get on that horse and we get to work . And you stay the hell away from her . Or you leave here alone ... and you don't ever come back . George .

Everything will be all right . - A tree fell on him . - Poor Simon . He was my husband , but I never really knew him . No one did . He worked hard . Aye . Annie's voice : I can not deny it , Sadie , I felt a tremendous sense of relief when I saw he was dead . I wanted to put everything about him behind me , as though he had never happened ... as though it was George who had come for me and brought me here . My prayers had been answered . God forgive me .

George . - Where is Simon ? - He's gone ... to the fort . We needed a new axe . Mr . Treece was very upset . He told me Simon shot at him . Not at him . In the air .

In the meantime ... we'll manage . - Would you like some tea ? - No , thank you . I can see you're busy . George . Why did you lie to him ? Why did you lie to the reverend ?

Mullen's voice : January 6th : I have determined to journey to the Herron homestead to investigate for myself . Mr . Mullen . I'll be gone by the time you're back . This country is testing me . I must confess it got the better of me . You were right to send me back , I suppose . You can send me some correspondence on the girl . I 'd be interested to know what you discover . There you go . Good luck . Mullen's voice : The decision whether to charge Mrs . Herron weighs heavily upon me . The difference between Mrs . Herron's account and that brought by Reverend McBain is so striking as to demand further inquiry . I've sent word of my desire to examine the body and to interview all involved . ( gunshot ) George : God damn it ! - Piece of shit ! - Annie : What happened ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow to get a shovel so we can bury him . - You were gone a long time . - Aye . I needed time ... to think . - About what ? - About what to do now . I don't know much about farming . Simon was the one who could do all that . I was brought up in a town ... in a big house , with help . I don't think I can do this now . You won't be alone . I'll be here . Our farm will be a proper farm . We'll have chickens and geese and cows ... - and babies . - Annie . I -- I don't even care if we can have this now . What are you thinking ? I have nowhere else to go . It's not right . What we're doing , it's not right . I know . We should have waited . All right ... but I want you now . I can't help it . I don't want to face anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will become of us ? Henry Mullen . I'm looking for George Herron . Mr . Treece : He's not here . He's gone to visit his aunt . I've sent word with Reverend McBain . They'll be coming within the week . - Never mentioned it . - I need to speak with him . - Take a statement . - Not to worry . You can stay with us . He'll be back within a few days . It wasn't right , her being there with those two laddies . Simon was mainly stupid , very different from George . George is a sweet laddy . We feel so badly for him . He's hardly said a word since the accident . When they first arrived , George came to the church every Sunday . Then she arrived . The reverend said she was raised by our church , but -- - We had them for supper . - They left in the middle of dinner . - Jenny : George didn't want to go . - Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon ran him off with a gun . - A gun ? - Aye . I ... told Reverend McBain . I'll take them straightaway and let her try them on . She will be so pleased . I have more work if you have time . I have nothing but time , sir . Yes . Yes , this is absurd ... - you in here . - Oh , I like it . Yes , well ... freedom has little to do with one's physical surroundings . Allow me . I will be back . Mullen's voice : The spareness and isolation of the place oppressed me . Life here would be barely supportable under the most favorable conditions . There was a grave , as Mrs . Herron had said . But it was empty ... the surrounding soil soaked in blood . Someone had been here recently , to judge by the fire still smoldering in the ruined fireplace . Annie's voice : I heard his skull crack . ( gunshot ) ( animalwhining ) What are you doing here ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Henry Mullen . George Herron . I'm here to examine the body of the deceased ... your brother . It was an accident . There seems to be some question of that . Put that gun down . You told the Treeces you were visiting your aunt . I was . I am ... but I decided to come here first . - To check the trapline . - I saw the body , George . In the fireplace . Wolves dug him up . It was ... gruesome . Some parts were dragged into the bush ... chewed to the bone . So I gathered up everything I could find ... - and I burnt it . - In the fireplace ? I couldn't think of what else to do . - How old are you ? - I'm 1 7 , sir . 1 7 ... I know your story , from both the reverend and Mr . Treece . Now I think you should tell me in your own words . There's not much to tell . My brother had an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree fell on him . And Annie ... his wife , well , it undid her , I guess . - She took off . - Fond of her ? Aye . We get along all right . We both like books and music . And your brother ? Did you get along with him ? Simon and I didn't have much in common . But he worked hard . He wanted to make a better life for himself , for us . - And I appreciated that . - I see . What are you doing ? I'm taking your brother's remains with me . - You're taking them ? - Yes , as evidence . They'll be returned to you if you wish , for burial . - Or we can bury them for you . - No , I'll bury him . Very well . Are you going to continue homesteading ? It's all I have . Mr . Treece says he'll help me plant in the spring . They've been very kind to me . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become of Annie , sir ? If the evidence supports her claims , we'll charge her ... and she'll go to trial . - So she can hang ? - If she's found guilty , yes . And if she is found guilty , you'll be considered just as guilty for withholding evidence . You understand this ? You're under investigation as well . Aye . But she's not guilty , Mr . Mullen . I can say that before God , my maker . I'll need a sworn statement to that effect . - Aye , sir . - Do you like hunting ? I like to live , sir . My brother taught me that much . Mullen's voice : My journey has both raised and answered questions . That crushed skull is damning evidence . But George Herron is adamant ... that it was accident . I now had a picture of her life there - - a hard life with a hard man . Hard enough to drive a woman to madness ? Or murder ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mind to charge her and let the jury decide the matter . - Mr . Mullen is back . - Yes . He's very tired . He slept under the stars last night . - Did he speak to George ? - He doesn't report to me . - I must talk to him . - ( Ruthchuckles ) He doesn't report to you either . Hand me your linens . And your rags ? - Ah , Mr . Sellor . - Sorry . I heard you were back . - Yes . Is there a problem ? - Not exactly . Mrs . Herron asked me to mail this , but the postmaster said her last letter to Sadie Johnson was returned , marked "" deceased . "" I find it peculiar that she hadn't been told . I thought it best . She's been under considerable duress -- I tell you what , leave it with me . I would never forgive myself if I did her any harm . She's done enough harm to herself , I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ? - Full rehearsal this evening . - Congratulations . - I look forward to seeing it . - Thank you . - Mr . Sellor ? - Yes ? Don't mention anything to Mrs . Herron . Please . Will you have your supper now , sir ? Yes , I'll be dining in here this evening . The girl would like to have a word with you . I'll speak with her tomorrow . - Sir -- - Thank you , Ruth . Annie's voice : Dear Sadie , why have you not answered my letters ? I can only think you have not received them . Hell is truth . Seen too late . He was no longer a boy . The child was gone in him . ( animalgrowls ) Get away from there ! Go ! Go ! Go ! You don't scare me ! The cut had been made by an axe . Deep and gruesome , cutting through bone and right through the heart of him . Whatever had happened out there , Sadie , had ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all because of me . I had set them against each other . I told you I would bury him . You say it was an accident . - Just like you said . - Why didn't you leave him alone ? Help me . ( Georgescreams ) ( crack ) George : I killed him . I watched him spout his last bloody breath . And there was no sign . You wanted him dead , too . We're both guilty , I know that . But nobody need judge us . I did it for you . He was going to come back and have you , he said . Laughing at me . He was talking crazy about what he 'd do to you . So I picked up the axe ... and I flung it wildly . And he went down ... with one scream . Then he just looked at me . And that was it . It was much too easy . Much too easy . Aren't you coming to bed ? Maybe we both wanted it . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone . It was better when you didn't know the truth . Because every time I look at you , I remember pulling that bloody blade out of my brother's back . ( @horse_neighs ) Where are you going now ? The truth is chasing me , Annie . I can not sleep and I can not stay here . - I'm going to the fort . - It's both of us , - not just you . - If someone comes , just tell them the truth about what I did . I'll turn myself in . They don't need to know about us . Don't go ! I hope that I never see you again . Annie's voice : I waited for days , going slowly mad . I thought George had gone to the fort and that he would hang for a crime that was as much mine as his . Finally , I could bear it no longer . ( @breathing_heavily ) I know my part in this . But I did truly think that George loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has she been ? Mrs . Herron ? Not so well . Worried . And sick in the mornings . She is with child . It's quite apparent . She's having a baby . You can't hang her now , can you ? It's not up to me , Ruth . I think it is . I know it is . Annie's voice : I need you here , Sadie . I have an enormous favor to ask . Please send word immediately , or I really will go mad . Mr . Mullen . - I have something to tell you . - Yes , but first - - please , take a seat , Mrs . Herron . This has been returned . I'm so sorry . Have you come to some conclusions ? Not yet . It's more complicated than I anticipated . That's all I can say . I'll have Ruth bring you some tea . Mullen : "" In the matter of Mrs . Annie Herron -- In the matter of Mrs . Annie Herron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion of this office that there's insufficient evidence to warrant the laying of charges . for any criminal act .

In the months that followed i couldn't stop thinking About why the man had chosen me . Did i look so vulnerable , Or did i have a weakness in my character So evident that it attracted the man to me ? Even now , i can not say . He was right about one thing though-Duran pharmaceuticals did go public , And i did check the quotetron for it-Every single week .

No word ever passed between us , and no sign , Not even a shared glance or smile .

I began to think of my hand as possessing a powerful attraction , In the way that males of certain animal species Have natural adornments that females find irrisistible-Like the peacock's fan . At the same time , i understood what was happening between us Could not be duplicated , Even if i spent every available hour Clutching poles in full view of all the city's females . I realize conversation is a risk-But i'm ready-Ready to take the next step . Oh god , what would i possibly say to her ? Share my views on republican party politics ? What if she's a democrat ?

I'm sorry . Our first fight . I suddenly remembered ardrey's territorial imperative From my psychology class in college . I understood then that i was only potent and attractive In that small area around the pole . Outside of it , the electricity would fail . It was sweet . Was it really worth what i might be losing ?

I think I got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that many . It wasn't a question . That's where you get these bruises on your spine . Your stepmom always talk that much ? You know how sharks have to keep swimming or they'll die ? She's kinda like that with talking . Take a deep breath . Let it out . Again . And one more . When was the last time you got your period ? God . Um ... It must have been ... A long time ago . I don't feel ... that unhealthy , you know ? If I wan na be thin , don't they say that that's better ? I'll outlive the normies . - You like this ? The furry ? - What ? No , I'm not ... Lanugo . Your body's trying to keep you warm by making more hair . But you know that , right ? I talk to kids like you all day , every day . So , I know that you are , as a rule , full of shit . You're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing you like that . But the way that you're going , one day , you won't wake up . And I'm not going to treat you if you aren't interested in living . Good speech . If I'm going to help you , you have to agree to a few things . - What ? - No talk about food . I'm not interested . It's boring and not very helpful . And your parents can't talk about it either . - You're on your own , understand ? - Yes . You'll agree to a minimum of six weeks in-patient . I don't need more in-patient . Then find another doctor . - Well ? - He wants to admit me on Monday . He said that ? He said he'll admit you ? This is great ! What exactly did he say ? Is Dad coming ? Uh , you know , we didn't have much time to talk , but he's on his way home . Dad's coming ? Mm ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to wait . - So , he's not coming . Hey , what happened to that sweet girl that I met at Transitions ? - The Mexican . - Angel ? - Mm-hmm . - Her mom's from El Salvador . You know what I mean . You two seemed very close . And I just ... I want you to know that it's fine if you were . - Thank you , Susan . - Jesus , Mom . Just because her mom is gay does not mean that she's gay . You know , you can get married now . I'm not saying you are . I'm just saying , you know , if you ... if you have that kind of turmoil , then you might feel like you don't deserve to eat . Pussy , you mean . Are you done ? I've got a special dessert . Yup , all done . Thanks . Well , I'm so sorry Dad couldn't be here for your lesbian coming out party . It really sucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I'm ... I'm fine . Will you try ... this time ? I mean , maybe this doctor is really great . Can you please just try this time ? Ta-da ! Isn't it funny ? It's a cake . With the syrup and the nuts , it was literally heaven . Life in these arctic temperatures is measured by the briefest moments of light ... - This is it ? You're sure ? - Yeah , this is the address . Oh , hi . - Oh , that's okay . - Please . - So I can get my points . - Okay . - So , what's your name ? - Ellen . Anna . Bulimia nervosa . Although , more nervosa than bulimia now . That's Kendra . Here you go . Welcome to Threshold . I'll , uh ... I'll go get Lobo . Lobo ! This is ... very nice , homey . Hey . Uh , hi , are you Lobo ? Lucus . Like "" mucus . "" But I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dame ? - A broad , a skirt . Raymond Chandler is my muse since I got here . To the hardscrabbled streets of LA , that is . - Oh . - Wow . - I'm from London , originally . - London ? How interesting . Did you come all this way for Dr . Beckham ? By way of Jersey . It's a sordid tale . - But he's the best , so ... - Well , Ellen's from Los Angeles . - How interesting . - Not really . Well ... see you around , sweetheart . God . He seemed nice , funny . Here we go . Nothing fancy . That's Pearl . Anna's in here too , when she's not running around . We usually have six patients , but , right now , we have seven because of Luke . - He's down the hall . - I like your pants . Oh . Thanks . I , uh ... like your ponies . Thanks . Sorry . It's gross . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a permanent tube in her stomach . She refused to chew . Ew . I chew . So , I'm gon na have to search this . Any knives or X-Actos I should know about ? - Are you cutter ? - Nope , not that on-trend . - Some of these girls are cutters ? - Oh , yeah . We have a lot of overachievers in here . - I'm gon na have to take these . - It's just a multivitamin . It's a vitamin bottle . Could be diet pills , speed , laxatives ... And we don't have time to test for everything . We'll give you a vitamin . And can I have your phone , please ? Do you have any other electronic devices ? iPad ? My iPad doesn't even have wireless . I just use it to draw . Dr . Beckham says you should draw on paper until he says different . - God , what did you say to him ? - I just explained the situation . Okay . Um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , is Dr . Beckham here ? I 'd like to just pop in before I go . He's only here in the morning and usually stops by after dinner . I just thought you should know about her tricks . Oh . We know all the tricks . That's why we don't have any doors . They know we 'd jog around the room all day if nobody could see us . It 'd be like the Rexie Olympics up in here . Okay . Call us if you need anything , and , um ... we'll see you soon , okay ? - Be good . - Okay . Not too good . Not perfect . Got it . I got it . Pearl usually gives the tour , but , obviously , she's not going anywhere . So , Luke is your guy . - Ellen , Luke . - We've met . Onward . This , as you can see , is a living room . We meet here twice a day for "" Bitch and Bawl . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Well , it's what I call group therapy . - And what's the deal with levels ? I prefer to think of them as draconian points earned for good behavior . Like when you were little and you had chores , if you had chores . This is the torture chamber , also known as the dining room . Chores , uh , which I never had because that would assume I had parents who gave a shit ... - So , you do chores to get points ? - Among other things , yes . And Lobo and the other nurses and counselors can give them or take them away at will . Amass enough points , level up . Earn extra privileges , like , you can go out of the house on your own . I'm actually currently deciding on where to go on my next outing . So far , I've eaten at nine of the places on Jonathan Gold's essential 100 list . Jonathan Gold is my muse . Raymond Chandler was your muse a few minutes ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep up with me . Onward . So , welcome to our new house member , Ellen . - Hi . - Hi , Ellen . Hello . So , how this works ... This is just an end of day check-in . The morning sessions are a little more focused . This is just to talk about struggles and our victories and ... any other issues you might be having here in the house . Let's start with Pearl . Struggle ... I got tubed today , and , uh ... you know , it hurts . Now , I feel all ... hot . I can't stop thinking about how many calories are in that drip . - They won't say . - Fifteen hundred . I looked it up . I was tubed a couple times . Ellen , we try not to crosstalk . We don't talk about numbers or weight or anything like that . - Sorry . - Fifteen hundred ? How are you feeling right now , Pearl ? It's okay . I don't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gon na be burning it off , especially when everybody's here watching you ? Do you know why you feel that way ? - Because I ... have an addiction ? - In a way , yes . When the exercise and the rituals kick in and ... the cyclical thoughts about weight take over , everything else goes away . And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric , like a drug addict or an alcoholic . It's not about "" thin enough , "" right ? There's no "" thin enough . "" It doesn't exist . What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wan na feel . And we give you a lot of rope here . It's scary , but only you can decide ... to see what's good , to be alive . - You understand ? - Kind of . - I'm trying . - Yeah , you are . Talk to me , brother . My victory was leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means I get to go to Guelaguetza , Oaxacan restaurant , number 26 on Mr . Gold's essential 100 . And affordable , which is also essential . Ballet companies don't pay you a fortune . That's great . Talk to me about your struggles . Don't know , really . I guess I'm obsessing about my injury and ... if I'll be able to perform when I get get out of here . - But I've got a goal . So , that's good . - You have a couple of goals . Eating Oaxacan and getting healthy so you can dance again . Damn straight . I've got goals coming out my wazoo . Ellen ? Struggle , um ... Coming here . I mean , accepting that I have to come here . So , maybe your victory is that you're here . Hmm ? Yeah , maybe . Did Luke explain about meals ? No . By the time we got to that , he was onto some musical thing . - ? Sugar blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar blues ? - ? Sugar blues ? - Luke . Eat what you want . If you have special food , like Kendra here does , that's fine . - We'll get it for you . - That's it ? No , you're definitely judged . When you eat , points magically appear . What he means is , if you're maintaining or moving towards your goal , you go up a level . - How you do it is up to you . - Really ? Yeah , but no one leaves the table at mealtime , and bathrooms are locked for 30 minutes after . And there's no point pretending to eat or throwing up into the plants or whatever . It smells , and it doesn't end up on the scale . Got it . - Thank you , Lobo . - De nada . - All right . Who wants to say grace ? - Oh , sorry . - Dear Jesus ... - Take us to church . Allah , Oprah , My Little Pony , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bodies what they need to grow strong and beautiful because every single person at this table deserves to live . - Mm . - Amen . Bon app ? tit . Oh , yeah . Oh , my God . This is so fucking good . Oh , my God . Pearl ? You freaked her out with the 1500 thing . I mean , it's not your fault ... - I didn't mean ... - Oh , no , no , no . It's not your fault . I mean , don't stress . - How many in-patients have you done ? - Four . Six . The rest of these guys , they have no idea . I mean , Pearl's not actually just upset about the tube . She might get kicked out . Seriously ? I mean , she looks pretty sick . No , Dr . Beck says that hospitals are for sick people . We're here to get over that shit . Ice cream's my favorite . - It comes up the easiest . - How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barf is clear and it doesn't burn anymore . Oh . I wish I could barf . I'm only good at the binging part . - You purge ? - I tried . It's not my thing . So , how do you get rid of it if you can't barf ? - It's gross . - Tell me . Your ponies wouldn't want you to cry . Hello Kitty wouldn't want you to cry . The unicorn on the stairs wouldn't want you to cry . Hey , there . - Settling in ? - Yeah . - Where's everyone else ? - May I ? Okay . Anna went to the movies . Points . Cool . I'm having your family come in for a group session tomorrow afternoon . It's standard when I see new patients . If it's productive , we'll do it from time to time . Okay . - Even my mom ? - Even Mom . Wow . I told her it takes me longer to drive in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kiddo . Glad you're here . I didn't mean it . I ... I mean , I didn't mean for my drawings to do what they did . - What ? - On Tumblr . I know Susan told you what happened , and ... it'll come up , I bet . Right . I was just doing what all my teachers told me to do . Draw what you know ? - Yeah . - I hear you . Just keep it for yourself , for now , okay ? Okay . Good night . Oh . Sweaty . I ran home from the movies . Don't tell anyone . Okay . - What movie did you see ? - Oh , um ... They were playing Shaun of the Dead at the New Beverly with Zombieland . - No way . - Yeah . Emma Stone's kinda fat . Don't you think ? Oh , no , I think she's just big-boned . She's , like , at least , a size six . - Anyway , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . I'm breaking 120 today , dolls . - Is that going up or down ? - Up . Eighty-nine when I came in . Eighty-nine ? How tall are you ? You're a beautiful unicorn . - You , cheer captain , come on . - All right . Let's do this . Megan's been gaining . She's flipping out . But , I mean , she wants to , I think , for her baby . - She ... She's pregnant ? - Oh , nobody said ? - Jesus , I didn't even think about ... - I know . That's why Luke calls her "" the unicorn . "" She gets her period once and gets pregnant off some guy she barely knows . I'm never having a baby . No way . Where are you ? That's probably Dad , right ? - Making some excuse . - Yeah , annoying . - I heard them fighting this morning . - Great . That's great . Oh , my God . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost . It's okay . Why ? Mom , it's okay , it's okay . My God . - No dad ? - I'm sorry , work . Well , he has to support his family ... and pay alimony , still , and the medical bills and ... Understood . Bet you didn't expect this much "" gynergy "" today . I do think this is a record number of mothers for one patient . Okay , I want everybody to understand nobody's on trial here . I just want to get a sense of the family . Well , until recently , Ellen lived with us . She moved in with her father 18 months ago . We thought it might be good for her to heal that relationship . He's shown little interest in who Ellen really is . He's only interested in who he wants her to be . Ellen is an artist . She's extremely bright and sensitive . She was never going to go into Chinese - or computers or what have you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants for you ? I don't know . I guess ... I think he just wants me to be able to make a living . - Exactly . Is that a crime ? - No crimes , remember ? The point is , Ellen's father never saw who she was . He left when she was very young ... Yeah , because you were sleeping with your best friend over there . - No , that's not why the marriage ended . - There's a better reason ? We are not here to defend our relationship . When are you going to come up with a different narrative , Susan ? - What narrative ? - What narrative ? - Susan ... - No , this is the truth . - Jack didn't wan na have sex . - Well , he likes it with me just fine . - Twice a week , like clockwork . - Oh , my God . Besides , he's not the one who abandoned her . We did not abandon Ellen . We moved to Phoenix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Because we 'd been dealing with Ellen's illness alone for years . I didn't abandon my daughter . I love her more than life . I just didn't know what to do . She's dying right in front of us . What's going on with you right now ? I'm sorry ... that I'm not a person anymore . I'm a problem . - And it's all my fault . - Fuck fault . Fault and blame have no place here . Only how you wan na live , moving forward . Who you wan na be . How about you , Kelly ? What do you think of all this ? Um ... I , uh ... I feel kind of angry , I guess . I just ... I just don't really ... Really get it . You know , just ... eat . I don't know . It's just like ... It's not her life that she's just missing out on . It's ... It's my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ... a sister . You know , I look at pictures of my prom and stuff , and ... and all I think of is , like , "" Oh , that's when ... Ellen was in the hospital , "" or ... "" That's when she fainted on the bus . "" All right . And all of my friends , they think that she's some kind of freak . - Like , a freak who killed a girl . - Because of the blog ? - Tumblr . - Yeah , and that's bad enough , but now , people wan na be like her and look like her and go through what she's going through . Nobody died because of Ellen's artwork , okay ? There's plenty of stuff out there for people to fetishize . But that certainly didn't help , to have notoriety for starving ... But that's what I'm saying . - Ellen has talent . - I didn't say she doesn't . But if you hadn't made her take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her voice . Ellen took it down herself after that young woman died because she knew it was the right thing to do . - You are so full of shit , Susan . - What ? Do you even hear what Judy is saying ? A young women died . - No , no , no . - Meet me in the car . I'm sorry , we just ... We just can't take you with us right now . - We're gon na miss our plane . - Okay , all right . - All right ? - Okay . Ellen ... be strong , okay ? Hey , I'm really sorry if I got you in any sort of trouble ... - Please , no , I'm sorry . I hate that ... - No , no , no , it's ... it's whatever . You can forget it . What a shit-show . You really need to get better so you never have to see those people ever again . If you die ... I will kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Dinner . - I'm staying up here . You don't have to eat , but the rule is that everyone has to sit down . Have you been thinking about baby names ? Not yet . I have a whole list of favorites that you can have . I was actually considering a new moniker . - What about Dean or Tex ? - When I get out of the first trimester . Do you want to get out of the first trimester ? - Jesus , Luke . - Stay out of this , Mia . This is between us rexies . She knows what I'm talking about . I don't know . I'm terrified . It just feels so ... out of control . But it's kind of a miracle , you know ? ' Cause I didn't think anything was working down there . So , maybe ... I'm supposed to have this baby . And I want to . I just want to think about something besides me for once . Amen , sister . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't wan na jinx it . - No , please . A shower would be so cute . - Yeah , no . All right , fine . Maybe . - If I get past 12 weeks . - Yay ! Well , we're gon na help you make it past . Every bite you take feeds the miracle . Pass the potatoes . - Oh , my God ... - Are you sure ? - I don't know . - Here they are . - Just don't talk . - Here they are . - Miracle potatoes . - Miracle , miracle potatoes . - I like that . - Pretty good . How about the newbie ? How you doin ' ? Finished . - What happened ? - She had family therapy today . - Oh . - Makes sense . Mm-hmm . Hey . I missed dinner . I found your barf stash . Keep this to yourself and I'll get you some laxatives . - I don't ... I don't use ... - Come on , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that thing that you do ? What thing ? Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger than , what , a silver dollar ? Deal . Cigarette for dinner . - That's not gon na get you points . - Not in the mood . Okay . And who in hell made you house den mother ? You walk around here like you've got it all figured out . Well , if you're so fixed and special , why don't you go back to New Jersey or London or wherever the fuck you're from ? I am going back , as soon as my BMI's closer to my age . But right now , I 'd rather try and help people than mope about feeling sorry for myself . You have no idea how I'm feeling . - I never said I did . - And what ? You wan na help people ? What are you , a doctor now ? - You feel pretty proud of yourself ? - Yeah , I am , actually . I'm moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scares you . But people actually go home sometimes and have a life , even people with fucked-up families . Yeah . There goes that fucking excuse again , huh ? Enter . Hey . - Hey . - Don't be all pleased with yourself . Wow . I never thought I 'd meet anyone more defensive than I am . And yet ... So , you've been here awhile . Six months . - Is that you ? - Hard to believe , I know . I didn't mean that ... Yeah , I can tell that it's you . Incredible . You know what it's like to be 19 and feel like you've already peaked ? Um , a relief . No . I loved it . I could push it and push it . And then I broke and went batshit , obviously . But my knee's getting better , and my company director says he'll have a place for me as soon as I get my act together , so ... - It's my drawing . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a year ago . That's why I acted like such a spaz when you first got here . - You're like my ... - You're muse ? Shut up . I just figured , somebody so talented , I had to be brilliantly charming to get you to like me . - Well , you overshot . - I'm aware . In my defense , though , I've been running on empty for so long that when I actually eat now , I get this crazy burst of energy . - That's why you're so weird . - I'm always weird . That's why I'm ... assertive . How do you do it ? Eat . I mean , I see you , and I just ... I get ... I get all panicky even thinking about it , like , the world is gon na fall apart . I feel that way . But you know , feel the fear and do it anyway . Yeah , but aren't you scared you won't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Be like one of those guys who has to be lifted out of his bed with a crane ? Yeah , but Dr . Beck says that's not gon na happen , so ... - Yeah , but he has to say that . - Well , he's pretty straight-up . Plus , I'm not gon na lie . I'm really fuckin ' hungry . Like , two years worth of hungry . Whenever I can't sleep , I draw food . Oh , yeah ? Like ... what ? - Do you know what a Goo Goo Cluster is ? - Oh , my God . Yeah , greatest candy bar ever . Peanuty , marshmallowy greatness . Oh , it's 240 calories there , 110 from fat . Whoa . Calorie Asperger's . - Maybe . - My last meal would be a whole box of ' em . Oh , yeah ? How would you eat them ? Show me . You wish . Um , right . Well , I 'd better ... Right , right , right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I be ? Good night . Epic . Step on . - Unless you wan na face the other way . - No , I'm good . I didn't sew rocks into my panties , if you're worried . I'm not . Step off . Wow , that's bad . You know what the body burns after there's no more fat ? Muscle . Organ tissue . Pretty soon , you're gon na be flopping around like a boneless fish . Thanks for that . Yeah , I'm scared straight . Anna , you're next ! I want a baby dragon . - Megan ? - Huh ? - What do you think ? - It's good . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Okay , I'll finish it . I told her not to . You feel anything ? Not yet . I like what you said before ... about thinking more about somebody else . Yeah . I think that's what being a mom is supposed to be about ... you know ? - Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not like I know what I'm talking about , but ... No , I ... I think you do . - You're gon na be a good mom . - ? Sugar blues ? - Thank you . - ? Everybody's singing the sugar ... ? Huh . Good evening , ladies . - Good evening . - Hi , Luke . Oh , wh ... What is ... ? What's that noise ? You hear that ? It's so weird . I feel like there's , uh ... Oh ... Oh . You know you want it . Shh ! Okay , don't make it a sex thing . It is a sex thing . Don't pretend it's not . Ready ? Oh ... Oh , there it is . - I ... I can't . - You can . Chew , swallow . The world will not implode , I swear . Come on , do it . Do it . Do it . - God . - Right ? - Hmm . - Touch it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't be so gross . - Come on , just a little . Get it on you . Come on , get it on you . Right ? Okay . Now , a little bite ... for me . - For you ? - Mm-hmm . I didn't even like you until five minutes ago , so , like ... - Maybe just , you know , not ... - You like me . - You like me . - Shut up . - She likes me . - Shut up . - Don't press your luck . - She likes me . You like me . - Take a bite . - Can we be done ? - You like me . Come on . Have a little bite . - Okay , seriously , back off ! God ... Coward . Tomorrow , you bite . Luke just made me touch chocolate . - He's so weird . - He's totally weird sometimes . I think the baby just moved . Smell that . Yeah , get in on that . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragons . How are you doing after family therapy ? It's pretty much how it always is when my folks are together . - Minus your dad . - Like I said . But I don't feel as bad as I thought I was going to . Why do you think that is ? I'm getting to know some of the people in the house . Some of them actually seem like they're doing okay . - I hope so . - No , I mean , really okay . Like they might get lives and be semi-interesting people . Did you just say something vaguely optimistic ? I did say "" semi "" ... but ... yeah . - So , the family ... - Can I be honest ? I've talked about my dad , all that family stuff . I have issues . Whatever . Talk is not helping . I think you're right . - Really ? - Generally , I just need a few facts . And we're never doing family therapy again . It doesn't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yeah , that's what my sister said . - I liked her . - Yeah , me too . We get along great . - I could tell . She was the only one who had something to say that wasn't entirely self-serving . Yeah . - Now , I'm gon na be honest with you . - Uh-oh . - I'm not crazy about your name . - What ? "" Ellen "" doesn't suit you . It's too old-fashioned . - I've never really liked it . - So , change it . I can't just change it . I can't , right ? Just tell people to call you by a different name . Or , if you wan na make it legal , you can fill out a form online in about ten minutes . I was thinking "" Ellie . "" - Ooh ... - That's no good . No . How about ... "" Eli "" ? Call me "" Eli . "" - You get your iPad ? - Oh , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put on some lbs . - Eli ? - Yeah . Don't tell me you're gay now , too . The male population can not take another quality defection . - Most definitely not gay . - Thank God . No , "" Eli "" is a ... new name for me . Ellen ... Eli ... Hm , I like it . It's very ... George Sand . You're dazzling . You know that , Eli ? So , I'm officially inviting Eli to my dinner out tomorrow night . As part of my reward , I can take anyone I want . Um , I'm not really restaurant ready , but thanks . It can be your pick . It doesn't even have to be on Mr . Gold's essential 100 . No , you should take someone who bites and chews ... We can walk there . All the way to Hollywood or wherever , and you don't have to eat . Can I run ? - I don't run , psycho . My knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read that it doesn't matter how fast you walk . It's distance . You burn the same amount of calories . - That's bullshit . - Will you just slow down a little ? I'm not even going that fast . Um ... I will have the number 12 with the rice and the egg roll . Mm-hmm . Can I have the Tom Tum Kai soup ? - It comes with your entr ? e . - Oh , that's all ... She'll have the number 12 , too , with the egg roll . No . - Yes . - No . She'll have the number 12 , too , with the egg roll . - And to drink ? - We'll have two Tsingtao . Your ID ? I ... I don't wan na put you on the spot or anything , um ... but we're from the hospice . For cancer . Um ... - I'm sorry . I can't serve you without ID . - It's just , um ... This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . I just ... I don't know . I wanted it to be special . Thank you very much . We can pick a different disease for different restaurants . You're so sick . - We both are , actually . - Yeah . I put it in there so nobody would ask questions . - Thank you . Thank you so much . - Yeah . ? Oh ... ? - You are so ... - ? Oh ... ? - Are you ... ? - ? Oh ... ? You are so wrong . - Hmm ? - Mm-hmm . - Bite . - I don't like egg rolls . Who doesn't like egg rolls ? Chew and spit if you wan na be lame , but you look thinner . If I taste it , will you leave me alone ? If you taste everything , I will leave you alone . Oh , yeah . So good . - Yeah . - Mm . - Mm ! - Right ? It's good , right ? Uh-huh . Mm . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Jesus Christ . That was a thing of great beauty . - That's super hot . - I know . It's what I was going for . So , I find out I can pull the patient ID thing all the way up my arm and hide it underneath my T-shirt , and I just get out past the nurse's station , I just walk out . - Where were you even going ? - The beach ? I don't even know . But there I am , just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard . I'm a full-on crazy person , and I'm jogging at the light ... when my mom drives up . - She was on the way to the hospital . - Oh , my God . You don't like it ? No , I do . It's just , um ... She ...

Not really . Hmm . Let's talk about that "" really . "" Just normal shit . The second you get boobs , it's like open season . You guys are pretty disgusting that way . We could at least have some manners about it . Not rub up against you guys on the bus . Oh , bus rubbing . Titty grabbing ... gross dirty talk ... night stalking ... You're all basically just a bunch of portable holes for men to fuck . Hmm . Yeah , that's what I'm saying . So ... have you ... done it ? Or ... was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orgasm ? - Um ... God ! - Sorry . - You don't have to answer that . - Personal . It's different for guys , you know . It's ... It's very different . There it is ... bobbing at you . Just bobbing , begging to be manhandled . That's ... That's way too much information . Not right now , but it could be . I just ... - Okay . - I ... I need to do my research . And you ... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you . Luke ... I'm falling in love with you . - God ! Luke , really ? I ... - I'm sorry . - No , sorry , it's just ... - No , you're right . It'll be like slapping two bags of bones together anyway . - We should go back inside . - Hey ! What the fuck ? What the fuck what ? Suddenly , you decide this is a physical thing , and I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na go pout and make this my fault ? All right , I'm sorry . Obviously , it was a bad idea . I just thought , if you knew I wanted it to be good or different ... And you're falling in love with me ? Okay , I'm sorry . I didn't mean to unleash the Kraken . - I've known you for , like , three weeks . - Well , I've known you for two years . Your drawing , the way you see things ... Yeah ? Oh , okay . This rexie girl , who saw my stuff on Tumblr , liked the way I saw ... so much , that when she slit her wrists , she left me the fucking note . And you know what her parents did ? They sent me pictures ... so I 'd really know what I 'd done . People say they love you ... but what they mean is , they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves . Or ... Or they love what they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with that . That's all kinds of wrong . I'm done . Okay , all right , you win ! All right ? You're the queen of darkness . Hey , come on ! - Megan ! - Megan ? Megan ! Megan , it's Luke ! Let me in ! I thought I was safe . I know , I know . It's gon na be okay . I know . I'm sorry . Guys , go back to bed . Can you push a baby out by throwing up too hard ? Yeah , that's exactly how it happens . Don't be an idiot . Good morning . - Good morning . - Hi . How's Megan ? She's at the hospital . She's fine now , physically . She's not sure she wants to come back here ... which I understand . Can we visit her ? Not yet , but I think , in a few days , that's exactly what she needs . I wan na go home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . That's not negotiable . What is , is how you deal with it . Would you read this ? - Do I have to ? - No . Okay . ' "" Courage ' by Anne Sexton . It is in the small things that we see it . The child's first step , as awesome as an earthquake . The first time you rode a bike , wallowing up the sidewalk . The first spanking , when your heart went on a journey all alone . When they called you ' crybaby ' or ' poor ' or ' fatty ' or ' crazy ' ... and made you into an alien ... you drank their acid and you concealed it . "" "" Later , if you faced the death of bombs and bullets ... you did not do it with a banner . You did it with only a hat to cover your heart . You did not fondle the weakness inside you though it was there . Your courage was a small coal that you kept swallowing . "" So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that ? It's her fault . She was purging . I think Megan wanted her baby . I really think she did . - We shouldn't have had the shower . - No , I don't think it was that . Eli , you and Luke found her . That must have been hard . That baby was never gon na make it . - Where is Luke , anyway ? - He's at the doctor for his knee . Eli ? Eli . What's going on with you ? Nothing . Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube . You've been making progress , but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight . I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me ... and I don't know anything about you . Okay , what do you wan na know ? - Do you have a wife ? - No . - Do you have kids ? - No . So , what's your damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my time , and I ... I like it that way . Women generally wan na spend time with somebody they date . Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy , doctor . Yeah , I guess it does . Lobo also tells me that you and Luke aren't speaking . It seemed like you and Luke had something good going . Whatever . He's totally gay . That would be easier , right ? Then you could write him off . - Does he talk to you about me ? - You know I can't answer that . - I just don't see the point . - In what ? There is no point . Or at least , big picture , we don't get to know what it is . Why we live , why Megan lost the baby , why that girl killed herself . - You're not reassuring me , doctor . - I can't reassure you . This idea you have that there's a way to be safe ... it's childish and cowardly . It stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't think I feel bad enough already ? I know I'm messed up ... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be . You know how . Stop waiting for life to be easy . Stop hoping for somebody to save you . You don't need another person lying to you . Things don't all add up . But you're resilient . Face some hard facts and you could have an incredible life . That's your pearl of wisdom ? Grow a pair ? That's a more concise way of putting it . Yeah . Unbelievable . Fuck you . - What's going on ? - Beck's messed up , you know that ? We all buy the hype , but nobody here is getting any better . - That's not true . - Yeah ? Megan's screwed . Anna has a treasure chest of puke under her bed . You live in fucking Ponyland . I'm about to get the tube , and he doesn't even care . Shit . I need another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey Ballet . Seriously ? Yeah . Come on , put your bag down . Let's go get another cancer beer . I can't . Sorry . I'm actually out of here . Did you hear what I said ? I'm finished . And you're leaving ? I can't . What , you think I didn't guess my knee was fucked ? And now that I'm done doing the one thing that makes me feel , you're my next thing . I know that that's not a plan . It's not a good one , anyway . But I need you ... Eli . Okay . Thank you . Bye . - Thank you . - Sure . There is no point . That girl killed herself . You look like a ghost . If you die ... I will kill you . You okay , honey ? I ... I just got up too fast . Sorry . You need to eat , girl . I'm fine . But thank you . I just need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your patients can just walk off like that and nobody stops her ? The problem with treatment for some of these kids ... is that we won't let them hit bottom . It's too hard to watch . But for Eli , the bottom is critical . How is there even less of you ? What did that doctor do to you ? Hi , Mom . - Is this all you've got ? - Yeah . All right . Well , everybody's waiting for you . - "" Everybody "" ? - Horses . They're very sweet beasts . Olive and I were worried that it wasn't gon na work out with that doctor . - Well , he had such an attitude . - Oh , God complex . - Totally dismissive . - And Susan ... - I mean , he really let her attack us . - He just wanted everybody to be honest . I don't like to speak negatively , but that woman's never said an honest word in her life . Of course , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fought really hard to get me into Threshold House . Yeah , look how well that turned out . And how about the way she talked about your mother's breakdowns ? They were transformational for me . Everybody should have more breakdowns . You didn't feel that way about them when they happened . Dr . Beckham called here earlier . He thought you might turn up . - He did ? What did you say ? - Well , that you 'd decided to leave . He wanted to make sure you were okay . A boy wanted to speak with you . Luke ? Is this somebody special ? I don't know . He ... He's my friend , kind of ... It all got fucked up . In the morning , Olive would like you to work with Freya . The horse ? Olive has grown tremendously out here . You'll thank me . But isn't that kind of like a conflict ? Her giving me therapy ? Freya does all the work . I'm just a conduit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduit . There's no electricity , but I think ... It's not so cold . You'll be okay . - You're gon na sleep , anyway . - Yeah , I'm tired . There's a bedpan here . So , if you need it ... It's better than stumbling around in the dark . Okay . - People pay money to stay here ? - It's rustic . They love it . - Ellen ... - "" Eli . "" You know , "" Ellen "" was your great-grandmother's name . I bet she didn't like it either . You know , I ... had a premonition before you came . - Really ? - You were a baby . I didn't hold you enough . I didn't bond with you . And , of course , that's true . I didn't know about postpartum depression . - I don't think that's it . - Well , anyway ... I spoke to Jean Williamson about it . Do you remember her ? - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Light . She's very interested in Olive's work and has been ... a great comfort to me around your illness . And she ... feels that it would be healing for the both of us if you allowed me to feed you . - It's rice milk . I made it myself . - Like a baby ? Well , like a mother and a child . I could hold you and rock you , and you could go to sleep . Uh , I don't know . No , I know . I know it's odd . But ... Well , as she said it , I felt real clarity that that's what we need . Can I think about it ? Yeah , okay . There's , uh ... not much left of you to lose . You know that ? - Dr . Beckham made that clear . - I know . Hmm . He said it's your choice , whether you come back or not . But I could tell that he was afraid that you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ... I know . I'm sorry . And ... I just want you to know that ...

"@@6860500 If no-one has any objections . I was wondering if we might take Mildred Lynch first . She a possible parolee and she's been waiting for quite a while . Is it agreed ? Mildred Lynch first ? Well , if I might just have a chance to glance at her file . What's in the classification report , Mrs May ? Mildred is popular in her college , though no-one can quite understand why . She's made no close friends , and doesn't seem to really like the other girls . But her manner is so ingratiating it seems to have got her by . What was her sentence ? Indeterminate . At the discretion of the board . She is still reluctant to face real and difficult situations . However , she has to some extent overcome the handicaps of her early background . She attends church services . Catholic and Protestant . And attends the Alcoholic's Anonymous meetings . That's been one of our troubles with her . Trying to do everything . Naturally , when she feels it will impress us . Such an eager beaver . Doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can continue our discussion later . Have Mildred come in . Oh , Mrs Crawford , you won't mind changing places with me ? This way , I won't be so much in her line of vision . Sit down , Mildred . You are in here on a forgery charge , consisting of passing bad checks . Yes , ma'am . But I can explain it . I thought the check would be alright . A friend of mine said he 'd cover it . You have a previous conviction in the county jail in Nevada ? Yes , ma'am . For receiving stolen goods . A fur coat . - Yes . But I didn't know it was stolen . You see , a friend gave it to me . Mildred . Mrs Harris is not at this moment asking for your excuse . That's all passed . Miss Holman and other members of the prison staff . Have been trying to fit you in to the life outside . We're bringing you here today to see if you're ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here again . We hope not . But other girls have said that before . They all make the same promises and they believe them . At the time . - Yes , I know . Well , maybe they haven't become genuinely conscious of their wrong . A very good answer , Mildred . Oh , I mean it , Mr Neeley . You have to be corrected inside . It isn't enough just to let your hair grow back . You know , falsifying has been one of your worst problems . Not only the lies you've told us , but also the lies you've told yourself . You thought you didn't deserve to be here . That ... What you did wasn't criminal . You still feel it wasn't ? I know now , that all my life I was headed that way . I thought I could steal ... anywhere . Even when I was a kid . Maybe I was lucky to get in here when I did . I've tried to improve myself in here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yes . We know all about that . But how do you feel about yourself ? Well . I'm sure willing to take a chance on it . I can only hope you will . Where is your family , Mildred ? Mildred ... Was abandoned when she was eleven . Alright , Mildred . If you'll step outside so we can further consider your parole . Then it isn't definite ? We'll call you . Wait across the hall . Yes , ma'am . Well , what do you think ? She is pretty , Mr Neeley . I move to grant parole under proper auspices . I second that . As soon as provision for parole can be arranged by the Parole Officer . All those in favor , say "" Aye "" . - Aye . - Aye . - Aye . Opposed ? - Majority carried , didn't it ? Have Mildred come back . I think she's a good risk . Sit down , Mildred . The board has just granted your parole . I'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sorry about . It's all so wonderful . I don't know what to say . Well , if you can think a minute , where would you like to go ? Well , somewhere new , so I could really start over . There is one in your pocket . What about Los Angeles ? We have a Parole Officer there who should be very good for you . That's okay . - Joan Willburn . She's young and understanding . Some of the girls told me I could take a new name . I always went for Diane . Diane Stewart , I thought . Diana , the huntress ? Who's that ? Mildred , maybe I'm being a little too hard on you . I'm an old fogy . You'll have to forgive me . No you're not . You're sweet . You all are . You understand , that parole is just a continuation of your sentence ? It's serving time on the outside . That being a prisoner still , you'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the Parole Office can find a job and a home for you . You'll be informed . With your ticket of leave , you'll receive $25 in cash to carry you over . And a dress and a coat . - A dress ? What kind of a dress ? - One made here in our shop . Oh . That will be nice . Well . Let your actions on the outside thank us . I hope we're right . All of us . All ? - Oh , you wet blanket . My male instinct . Which warns me that this young woman ... Is going to make things a lot harder for herself than she needs to . I would like to have spared her . Diane . Diane Stewart . I'm Joan Willburn . Hello . Oh . Hello . I was expecting a uniform . - I was expecting you to be different . Any objections ? - No . That's up to you . Is that the going-away outfit they gave you ? There was a blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My car is there . Where's your bag ? - Over here . Cigarette ? - Thanks . We rolled them ourselves up there . Most people don't like them . So , what's the job ? Nurse's aide in a private hospital here . If you don't like it ... You shouldn't have done such fine work at the prison hospital . It won't be so bad . I 'd like to be where there is life . Holy Toledo , Miss Willburn . Dames bossing you . Waiting on them . You don't know how I hate women . There are men patients , too . I like my men on their feet . I was talking about your work . Not your personal life . What did you have in mind ? Waitress . Cigarette girl . I don't know . - Like before ? That didn't work out too well . Diane ... it isn't easy to find jobs . Hospitals need helpers . They're even willing to take convicts . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You'll save car-fare . - You think of everything . Well , so your friend got here . Mrs Seeley ... Miss Stewart . - Hi . Well , I hope you're going to stay longer than that . After I saved that good room for you . I think it will be fine . What did you tell her ? She know about me ? You'll have to get over that . No-one knows . No-one has to . Except Mrs Haley at the hospital . And she doesn't talk . Don't you want to use it yourself ? You've paid for it . Not too bad . I was in here earlier . Opened it up for you . And plenty of closet space . That's another reason I chose the hospital . Because they provide uniforms . You don't have to worry about work clothes . They don't have full length one's up there . They think anything below the neck is unimportant . Well ... thanks for everything . And the flowers . We shall greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That's part of the job . And now what about dinner ? Is that part of the job too ? As it's your first evening , I thought we 'd go out on the town . If the State is picking up the check . Anyway , I 'd like to see your idea of "" going out on the town "" . I'll pick you up at seven . Well ... here's to a wild night on tomato juice . I'm sorry about that . But one of the first rules of taking ... - No drinking . I know . Well cheers , Miss Willburn . - Cheers , Diane . And now for dessert . Meringue glac ? e ? Peach Melba ? As you wish ? I'll have a chocolate sundae with chocolate ice-cream and nuts . Lots of whipped cream and heavy on the sauce . Yes , madam . And for you , Miss Willburn ? The same . Yes , Miss Willburn . Is that on the expense-account , too ? - Of course . Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Collins just came in . He's in the bar . Shall I tell him you are here ? - Oh , thank you . I'll do it . Who's that ? A friend . I'll only be a minute . Thank you . Now I'm not even supposed to kiss you ? Not when I'm on the job . I can't concentrate . Not when you're out with a pigeon , you mean . These girls are parolees , Larry . Not convicts . Excuse me . Excuse me . Parolees . How about a drink ? - I can't . I'm sorry about dinner . - Ah ... The fourth time in a row . - I know . I don't think much of your girl , either . I'll have another Martini , Jim . Baby , I don't know what I'm going to do with you . Most kids say : "" I think I'll be a Countess when I grow up or a fireman or Jane Russell . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grow up I'm going to be a Parole Officer . I'll never have dinner with the man I love ... As I'll always be eating out with a pigeon . Parolee . What do I have to do to get you to marry me ? Rob a bank ? I don't think that would help . I've been waiting a long time , Joan . Why don't you marry me and take me out of all this ? Larry . Okay ... I'll stop bothering you . If you stopped bothering me , I don't know what I 'd do . Darling . Don't you think you're being very silly tossing me on the open market like this ? I tell you . I'll be snapped up like hot cakes . I'll have to take that chance . Okay . Now , how about that drink ? Tell you what , I'll buy you both one . That's a chocolate sundae with chocolate ice-cream and nuts . Lots of whipped cream and heavy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had in mind . Okay , Jim . Tell Mr Connors I had to leave . I'll call him , Yes , madam . Diane . I told you I didn't want anyone to know here . Anyone . Turn that sign off , Diane . - What sign ? In big letters . "" I just come from prison "" . No-one will know unless you tell them . Men always asks questions . You know that . I didn't have a story ready . Larry's a friend . Besides , I asked him here to see me . Because he's your friend ? He wouldn't look at me I suppose ? You 'd be surprised . Look , Diane . I asked you out tonight because you're alone here . Most of the other girls have families to come to . This is a new town for you . You have no-one . You think that alone , I 'd get into trouble . Is that it ? No , that not it . It was your first evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ... it was nice of you . And now you don't have to see me again for thirty days . You report to my office on the 12th of each month . If you should need me in the meantime ... - I won't . I hope not . Well ... sleep well and late . You don't have to report for work until eight o'clock tomorrow night . Night ? Well ... I thought I told you . The night shift ? That's right . We'll see if we can get you on the day shift later . Hah ... thanks for leaving the best until the last . There goes my social life . Goodnight , Miss Wilburn . Something wrong with rolling my own ? It's a prison habit . I wouldn't do it outside . Goodnight . Thanks , Reg . - Anybody else got a check ? How about you , Diane . You've been here a week . For you , no charge . - It must be love . I don't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s waiting for a rich patient . Just you be patient . I'll be rich . Don't start on me . And don't charge me for that extra cup of coffee . You must have one evening off . When you get a convertible top on that ambulance , we'll go out with you . Man and wife . - Diane . Go on , Tilly ... go on . Hello . You said I don't have to see you until report day . - You don't . I talked to Mrs Haley today . She's very pleased with you . She says you're very willing . - Does she ? I get along . So , I just cashed my pay check . Alright ? - Of course . I'll pay my room rent as soon as I get home . I don't owe a nickel . - Good . Well . Thanks for not checking up on me . Goodnight , Miss Willburn . A friend of yours ? - A patient . I see her now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parole Office ? Who do you think you're kidding ? Are you a parolee too , Tilly ? - Glad to meet you . Of Miss Willburn ? - No . Miss Johnson . Parole Officers are all alike . They stink . Yeah . Right . That's the way I used to feel about it . You'll get over it . Funny I didn't see you up there . - I've been out a while . Make way , please . Thank you . The class of ' 47 . What little green pen were you in up there ? Ah ... Dormer House . Still got the same matron ? Yes . Mrs Baker is still the sorority house mother . What's a sorority ? Baker's an old pop , but she sure was a good sorority . What's with you ? - I think I know him . You mean , you wish you did ? My big idea is two to one . I thought it was after visiting hours . He doesn't know it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? He happens to be a friend of a friend of mine . Look , Diane . Save yourself the trouble . You think you're out of prison ? Well , you 'd better catch it now . You got a wall around you a mile high . You'll find out . All we rate are crooks , petty thieves , and if we're real lucky ... A great big ... ? - Oh , I look like a paper bag . Try it off the shoulder . - Shut up . Scramble your seams . That way he'll notice your legs . Yeah . I'll try it . How did you think of a thing like that ? I have to . You're on duty , Diane . - Yes , Mrs Haley . I see you two have found each other . Leave her alone , Tilly . She's doing fine . And I suppose I'm not ? A warning is only fair . There's been quite a few things missing lately . Thermometers ... Hypodermic needles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accusation . But you know who the first suspects always are , unfortunately . X-Ray me , why don't you ? That's what I mean ... by "" fair warning "" . I want to see you girls get a break . Then search me any time you like . Come now . Get to work , Tilly . My leg's been broken a month , and suddenly you turn up . Why ? Well , first . I like you , Cliff . Second , you're my boss And last but not least the ... The cost of living has gone up so ... - Absolutely no . [Door_knocks] Come in . Well , how's my favorite patient ? Oh ... oh , company . I can see you don't need this . Beer makes me sleepy . You sleep alright at night if you didn't nap all day . I've got Miss Hansen in the daytime . I 'd much rather sleep through her than you . How about that , Larry ? Not having seen Miss Hansen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate anything crooked . Don't you ? Oh ... excuse me . Nothing like a nice fresh bed . It makes a lot of difference , don't you think ? I hate a mussed-up bed myself . Don't you ? Sheets ought to be pulled nice and tight . No wrinkles . Cool and smooth . Nice soft pillows . There ... all we have to do is get into it . Here we go . - Thank you . By the way , this is Larry Collins . Miss Stewart . - How do you do ? How do you do ? - He used to be a good reporter . Now , he puts out the worst-organized column in our paper . You ever tried to read it ? - No . But I will . Thank you . A little higher . There you go . - Thank you . Comfortable ? - Oh , yes . Everything alright ? - Yes , thank you . How about another blanket ? - Oh , no , no . Some water ? - No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business .

I wasn't sleeping . I was thinking . I enjoyed your column very much . - Thanks . The parts I could understand . Now look , Miss ... - Stewart . Stewart . You seemed bright enough in there . And out here ? Would you mind handing me that paper ? Now then . Is it the first paragraph that perplexes you ? Would you sit down please ? With the possible exception of alert statisticians . You are aware that in recent years ... There has been a drastic redistribution of the population of the United States . Most of the migrants , understandably enough , have chosen California ... As their new home . The population , revealed by last year's census reveals that ten million souls ... That means "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator's here . Once again , more than a hundred years after the gold-rush . The eyes of American are turned towards the West . In simple language , that means that an awful lot of people are moving out here . I don't suppose you understood the second section either ? Yes . Yes I did . Only I've never seen a midget auto race . [Buzzer] I'll send you a ticket sometime . - I hate to do things alone . Well , I'll send you two tickets . - I don't know anybody . Alright then . I'll take you myself . Now , can I go ? Are they racing tomorrow ? It's my night off . [Buzzer] I'll pick you up at eight . I ... I said I won't be able to make it . Oh ... I got to hooked for dinner . Yeah . Something my dear boss got me into . That should break your day . Well , of course if you don't know where to find her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sorry , Larry . Oh , darling . She can't be that bad . Oh dear . I did want to see you . I wanted to tell you ... Oh , never mind . Another time . And try to have a good time tonight . Goodbye , darling . Excuse me . Look , you say I should go out and make friends . How can I when I haven't got anything to wear ? But that's a very pretty dress . It should be . I've changed it , switched it , turned it inside out . Now I'll try it upside down . I don't mind all that , but I've just got to have a new coat . I know it's a problem . - You don't . You don't care . What's the matter with the coat you have ? A raincoat . - Well , maybe it will rain . And why is it so important ? Who did you say asked you ? Rex Fisher .

I'm governed by rules , too . I'm sorry . Well ... thanks . Sorry I bothered you . - Have a good time anyway . You know what you can do . Molly , look at that coat . - You just bought a new coat . Oh , I can't help it . This was made for me . That's a size twelve , dear . Well anyway I've just got to try it on . Come on . You own these ? - Not this one . Oh , Miss . Where are the short coats ? Something light to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Yes . What color would you like ? - Oh , something bright . I'm getting tired of this black . I've a darling little box coat . Kelly green . It just came in . It will be lovely with your hair . Would you return this to the rack , please . I've decided against it . Tired ? You don't look so good . No . I'm alright , thanks . Oh . Your coat came from the cleaners . I put it in the closet . My coat ? - Yeah . The boy said you wanted it especially for tonight . Thank you . Oh , Larry . Larry , he's dead ! I know he's dead . Well , if he is , he forgot to lie down . That's him walking away . - Oh . Sit down in front . You sure you won't have a drink ? No thank you . What do you say we beat it ? Sure . No . I'll meet you at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There you are . - Thank you , sir . Hey , Larry . Oh hi , Steve . - What you drinking ? Oh , I'm sorry ... Come on , it's early .

Just the same , Pete , but they're not hers . They are , sir . They fell out of her coat , right beside the table . That's quite alright , sir . Oh , by the way . I forgot . It fell out of your pocket . Oh thanks . And this , too . And this . Your money ? - What do you think ? I stole it ? Now look , I didn't ... - Like a pig's eye you didn't . Why don't you go on and call the Cops ? All I said was ... - Look , genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital for laughs . Didn't you know ? Sure . Sure I did . That's why I asked you out . You didn't ask me . I asked you . Diane . - Leave me alone . Goodnight . - Not like this . My coat is at the cleaners . I borrowed this one from a friend . I don't want to go into that . - Well , you're going to . I didn't know the purse was in the pocket . I never even knew there was a pocket . I ... Why do you make so much of it ? I don't know . I didn't want you to think . I mean ... I thought you thought ... I guess you didn't , did you ? - No , I didn't . What are we talking about ? Nothing . I made a mistake . About what ? - About the whole evening . You didn't have a good time . I didn't either . I'm sorry . - Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me out in the first place . I made you .

You were on to it , weren't you ? Well my first job on the paper was covering acting classes . Was it that bad ? - Uhuh . But I wouldn't worry about it . Because if you're acting now , you're pretty good . You are pretty darned good . Goodnight , Diane . Oh . Are there any ... are there any midget auto races on tomorrow night ? [Door_knocks] Miss Stewart . Miss Stewart . Telephone . - Uhuh . Miss Stewart . Wake up ! I don't want to wake up . I've been awake all night and I'm tired . Go away .

Not unless the board feels she's corrected . How can they know ? How can anyone know ? That's the point . Unless she's had a chance to prove herself . You can't correct a criminal . - Stop it , Joan . The file is right about one thing at least . She does think and act like a twelve year old sometimes . Look around you . Who doesn't ?

But you can carry your loyalty to these young women too far , Miss Willburn . Diane feels I 'd let my personal feelings affect my duty as a Parole Officer . She made a mistake . So did I .

We'll see how things work out . Now we have other cases . I just don't know how she'll take this . Maybe that's important to find out too . What are you so droopy about ? There's someone looking for you , Tilly . Excuse me . Is it okay ? What did the board say ? Diane . Why did you write that letter ? - The board did grant permission ? Or did they ? They will ... they ... They didn't get to it this time . - Why not ? I told you . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did get to it . That's why I wrote them . To be sure they would .

Diane , we've only got two months to go . All my life all I wanted was to beat time . It can't be done . Up there ... or down here either . They've got us licked .

Beat it , Tilly . Let me go . You can't frisk me without at a warrant . - Save it for the jail , sister . More resistance , more time . What did you do ?

Oh , a Mr Collins came . He's already gone in . You let him in ? Well , Mr Collins is a man you don't keep out . You know , we don't like people walking in on a line-up just for entertainment . We're after that stick-up girl . The one that's pulling all those jobs over on Third Street . She makes us nervous . Oh , and about that Thompson kid . We picked up her boyfriend .

How much time did you do there ? It's no secret you know . Speak up . Three years . Grand theft auto . What are you doing here ? Suspicion of burglary . That's all . Next . Frieda Lockwood . I don't feel very good . A little hungover this morning , Frieda ? What's a sweet girl like you doing dead drunk in crummy dump like the Bluebell ? My boyfriend works there . Sorry this happened . Have you tried to get her out of this ? I got no place . Just made thing worse . That's all . Any of you want to hold them for a further look ? The second from the right , I think .

No address . I just got here . A nice welcome they give you in this State . What was found on you when you were picked up ? A wallet . The first time I've heard it called that . You'll have plenty of time for jokes , later . Next . The nerve . Hauling me here on a line-up . You know where I am every night . Tilly Thompson . Previous offense , manslaughter . Paroled three years . Two months to go . Present offense . Suspicion of theft . Not exactly suspicion . We've got your boyfriend and he talked , Tilly . Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And next . You . Norma Johnson . I don't live anywhere . I'm from Chicago . Hello , Miss Willburn . Too bad we got some of yours here . Do me a favor . Diane Stewart . Don't force her in the line-up . Those victims expect a crowd . 18 to 30 . Slight . Medium height . I'll stand in for her . - No stand-ins today . Diane , why did you send for me ? Larry is not out there ? - Of course not . They told me they told him when he called the hospital . Diane , it will be alright . I'm going to see the judge myself . I'll get you out of this . Your turn at the pony chorus . Step up . Name ? Margie Constance . Please , I'm going to be sick . - Where do you live ? Sixth Street . I forget the number . Any other numbers you forget ? You ! Put your hand down . Like 426a in the penal code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some water . John , check her out . We'll save her for tonight's show . Alright , sister . Put your hand down . I can't see . The lights are blinding me . Oh honey , don't get stage-fright . You're giving a wonderful performance . How will we bill you ? Name , sister ? Name , I said . Or do you want me to start talking ? Mildred Lynch . A parolee . In the State Institute For Women . I live at 114 North Hope Street . What else ? I don't know anything about any robbery . Even from the cabinet in the hospital ? No . No , sir . Somebody got a question ? I 'd like to see her with her hair pulled back . Off her face . You heard the lady . Oblige her . Put your hair back . Don't do it , Diane . You don't have to . I warned you . You oughtn't to come in here . I don't care who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't do it ! Come on ... come on ... Alright , sister . We're waiting . Do as your told . Next . It's almost over now . Please trust me . We'll have to hurry . The judge only promised us a few minutes . Some , we can never correct . Those we can , we've got to fight for . If you insist you acknowledge the arrest you must think of what it does to her . Another conviction won't go easy with her . Your board of trustees up there is pretty lenient ... too lenient . I know many of the judges hate an indeterminate sentence . I can understand . But how can you in a few hours in a courtroom know her entire background ? Not only for the ... Punishment she deserves . But for the help she needs . Also , in a courtroom a judge listens to lawyers . You would make a good one yourself , Miss Willburn . If you 'd said "" honest "" I would like that better . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can't just dismiss this . The girl herself admits she was guilty of interfering with these officers . Yes ? Her interference didn't exactly mar my duty , Judge Kendall . Granted , she was wrong , but ... We understand that on this particular night ... She was working on him too , I see . Now that we know that she has no connection with the Tilly Thompson case . Anything you want to do is okay with us . The point is , Your Honor ... There are rules laid out in the penal code that even our board can't ignore .

You are a very persuasive young lady and I hope you know what you are doing . Because if anything should go wrong . It would not only be worse for the girl . It would naturally mean your job as well . Good morning , Miss Willburn . Know where you're going ? Mexico ? You're sure ? Okay , come on and sit down . I'll buy you a drink . What will I do ? Scobie ! Scobie , get down from there . Get down from there . Sit down . May I ? I told you the kid was too young to take on a trip , but no ... No . You knew better . Thank you . Thank you . That's our train . That's your train , too . I kinda wish you wouldn't take it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane . When are you going to learn how to walk ? The Judge signed your release , Diane .

You thanked me by coming back . Miss Willburn ... - That's alright . T-G

Biggie and me , we're feverish with anticipation . We steel ourselves for a season of pandemonium . But after the initial celebrations , nothing really happens . Somehow our crappy Saturday job at the meatworks becomes full-time . And then Christmas comes and so do the dreaded exam results . The news is not good . A few of our classmates pack their bags for university and shoot through , and suddenly there we are ... Biggie and me , heading to work every morning in the frigid wind in the January of our new lives . Some days I can see me and Biggie out there as old codgers , anchored to the friggin ' place . Beside me , Biggie's face gets darker and darker . ( HORNSOUNDSDISTANTLY ) When the shift horn sounds , he lurches away , his last canon half-empty . "" Fuck it , "" he says . "" We're outta here . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wharf . We fill the ancient VW with tinned food and all our camping junk and rack off without telling a soul . I can't believe we've done it . The plan is to call from somewhere the other side of the city , when we're out of reach . I want to be safe from the guilts . The old girl will crack a sad on me . But Biggie has bigger things to fear . His old man will beat the shit out of him when he finds out . I can't tell Biggie this , but missing out on uni really stings . When the results came , I cried my eyes out . I thought about killing myself . Biggie's results were even worse than mine . He 'd really fried . But he didn't have his heart set on doing well . He couldn't give a rat's ring . In his head , he's always seen himself at the meatworks or the cannery , until he inherits a salmon netting license from his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not the brightest crayon in the box but he's the most loyal person I know . He's the real deal . We didn't meet until the second week of high school . I was new in town and right from the start , a kid called Tony Macoli became fixated on me . That's how it started ... a single decisive act of violence that joined me to Biggie forever . If you believe him on the subject , he acted more out of animal irritation than charity . But I felt like somebody ransomed and set free . Biggie became my mate , my constant companion . Friendship , I suppose , comes at a price . There have been girls I've disqualified myself from because of Biggie . Not everyone wants to have him tagging along everywhere . Right through high school , I had occasional moments , evenings , encounters with girls , but no real girlfriend , and mostly I don't regret it . Except for Briony Nevis . For two years , we're sort of watching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat-out beautiful . Long , black hair . Glossy skin . Dark eyes . I kiss her once at a party . Well , maybe she kisses me . But there , out of the corner of my eyes , Biggie , alone on the smoky veranda waiting to go home . I don't go to him straight up . I do make him wait a fair old while . But I don't go on with Briony Nevis the way I badly want to because I know Biggie will be left behind ... for good . We pull in to fuel up and use the phone . Biggie decides he's not calling home , so he sits in the VW while I reverse the charges and get an earful . I hang up and find Biggie talking to a chick with a backpack the size of an elephant saddle . She's tall and not very beautiful with long , shiny brown hair and big knees . She thinks she's on the coast road north and she's mortified to discover otherwise . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There isn't really even much consultation . We just pull out with this chick in the back . Meg is her name . Meg is as thick as a box of hammers . It's alarming to see how enthralled Biggie is . And I just drive and try to avoid the rear-view mirror . While I'm thinking about all of this , Biggie's gone and climbed over into the back and Meg's lit up a number and they're toking away on it with their feet up like I'm some kind of chauffeur . Biggie's never had much luck with girls . I should be glad for him . But I'm totally pissed off . We come upon a maze of salt lakes that blaze silver and pearly in the sun . I begin to have the panicky feeling that the land and this very afternoon might go on forever . ( TRAINCROSSINGSIGNALRINGS ) Biggie's really enjoying himself back there . I slowly understand why . There's the obvious thing , of course ... the fact that he's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else ... the thing that eats at me ... is the way he's enjoying being brighter than her , being a step ahead . Feeling somehow senior and secure in himself . It's me all over . It's how I am with him . And it's not pretty . The kombi fills up with smoke again . But this time it's bitter and metallic and I understand we're on fire . Without an extinguisher , there's not much we can do , once we're standing out there in the litter of our belongings , waiting for the VW to explode . But it just smoulders and hisses awhile as the sun sinks behind us . In the end , with the smoke almost gone and the wiring cooked , it's obvious we're not going anywhere . We turn our attention to the sunset . Meg rolls another spliff . We don't say anything . The sun flattens itself against the salt pan and disappears . The sky goes all acid-blue and there's just this huge silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can't imagine an end to the quiet . The horizon fades . Everything looks impossibly far off . In two hours , I'll hear Biggie and Meg in his sleeping bag . She'll cry out like a bird and become so beautiful , so desirable in the total dark that I'll begin to cry . TIM WINTON AND BOY : In a week , Biggie and Meg will blow me off in Broome and I'll be on the bus south for a second chance at the exams . TIM WINTON : In a year , Biggie will be dead in a mining accident in the Pilbara and I'll be reading Robert Louis Stevenson at his funeral . Meg won't show . I'll grow up and have a family of my own and see Briony Nevis , tired and lined in a supermarket queue and wonder what all the fuss was about . All of it unimaginable . Right now , standing with Biggie on the salt lake at sunset , I don't care what happens beyond this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets big around us , so big we just give in and ... watch .

( BIRDCAWSINDISTANCE ) ( @car_approaches ) ( CARRUMBLES ) ( RUMBLESGETLOUDER ) ( SILENCE ) ( BIRDSCHIRRUP ) WOMAN : The two detectives found his father on the bed . He 'd been dead for 10 days .

He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him and he 'd shot himself underneath the chin but he survived that . He had half of his face blown off and he had a big hole in his neck , where his ... around where his voice box was . So every time he spoke , he had to put his finger into his mouth , into his neck , and that ... just so he could ... was able to speak . It was , like ... something like that . MAN : I reckon it must've been early high school and Boner was older than me . He wasn't really a mate . I didn't have any mates in those days . A mate was probably just someone who was a bit less of an arsehole than an enemy . And people used to just treat me like shit . They used to call me fucking ' Flathead ' and there was these two older cunts that used to just belt the fuck out of me every lesson . They thought it just was good fun . Anyway , one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in A-wing , down this long bloody corridor .

"" You leave him alone . "" And he got to the end of the corridor and then he just fucking belted the shit out of them and he was saying , "" Leave the ... leave him alone , you fucking dogs . "" And no-one knew ... no-one except me knew why he was doing it . And he was standing up for me and yet ... he hardly knew me , really , and that was the first time anyone had ever really stood up for me . ( @engine_revs ) ( ENGINEROARS ) ( CARDRIVESAWAY ) MAN : Yeah , well , Boner was driving along one day and he had a whole heap of garbage on the front of his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked down to see what was going on . And there was a police car coming the other way . And he wandered across the road and pushed the police car off the road . Got down the road a bit , looked in the mirror and the police are chasing him . So he pulled up . The police said to him , "" You just run us off the road . "" He said , "" I didn't see you . "" He said , "" Well , that's pretty obvious you didn't see us . "" He said , "" You run us off the road . "" He said , "" We had to go out in the paddock there . "" He said , "" Look at the car . "" It's covered in grass and dirt and mud . "" What were you doing ? "" "" Oh , "" he said , "" what happened is ... I'm a snake catcher . "" I had a snake in a bag there .

"" He said , "" In the car . Do you want to he ! p me catch it ? "" He said to the police . They said , "" Nah , you're right , mate . Just go on your way . "" That's what ... ( LAUGHS ) He was a wild man . ( CHUCKLES ) MAN : I heard a bit about him but he was always in trouble . He was always in trouble with the police . He used to go to school and he got the cuts that many times , his hands and everything , that he decided that he wasn't going to get it anymore so he didn't do anything to the teacher but he just said , "" If you're gon na give me the strap again , "" ( LAUGHS ) "" you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about it . He was always in ... when were in school , he was always ... You know , he 'd be the one that's there ... baring his behind to the girls in the back . He 'd bend over and ... Well , he got expelled for that , so that was the end of him . ( ARCADEMUSICPLAYS ) ( @woman_laughs ) WOMAN : I ... I wasn't one of his molls . But , um , I remember how just going for one ride in his panel van would set you up with a reputation for the rest of your life . You didn't even really have to do anything with him , just be seen in his car . So , one day when I had to go the shops , I heard his car coming along and , um , started swinging my hips a little bit more . And he pulled up . And he only asked me where Jackie was , for God's sake , and I just said , "" Oh , I don't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking for a little while . A couple of ... Susie and Rachel went past in a car . I leant right in the car and sort of bent down and touched the gearstick and made out that , you know , I was inside the car , giving him a kiss .

Isaac , will you step to the blackboard and give the class a demonstration of the theorem ? Children , children ! Go ahead , Isaac . - Children , what is the matter ? - Oh , Isaac ! Look ! Who did this terrible thing ? Take your seats . I'm going to find out who did this . I would hate to think that one of my little girls would do such a thing . Don't look at me , teacher . I can't draw that good . No , I don't believe you did it , Susan . - Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't tell on him . - No , I'm not .

Go to the kitchen where you belong . Don't drop that jam on the floor . Go on . Pa ! Stop it ! You've whipped him enough ! He didn't mean to be bad . Did you , Johnny ? - He's not gon na get off as easy as that . - You're not gon na whip him again .

We've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , don't you put it off on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That's great ! What is it , Pa ? I don't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards . Right ? Right . The happiest moment in a woman's life is when she feels for the first time her baby's arms around her neck . No word's fine enough to describe it ! And the pride and happiness to see him grow up .

Now children , I know you're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ain't New York , but it's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he's just got a natural sense of humour . - I'm so disappointed Phyllis couldn't come . - She sends you her love , Ma . I'll tell you all about it later . - I have a secret . - What ? What ?

Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I'll be in in just a minute , mother dear .

You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you can't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we couldn't do that . The stuff is here and they'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I'll unload the stuff . You go on home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything to happen to you . - That's alright , go on home . - I didn't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you needn't bother at all . Everything's all ready . Where's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben !

That old oaken bucket , that iron-bound bucket , that moss-covered bucket , that hangs , that hangs ... - Merry Christmas , Pa ! - The same to you , Susan . Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we're all having breakfast together .

Ben ! Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there until Minnie and Isaac come with the children . I was just trying to see what Santa Claus put in my stocking . Ma , I wish they 'd hurry . Poor Ben is just starving to death . Well , I guess we won't wait any longer then . Ma , where's Johnny ? He was out late last night and he isn't up yet . Johnny , breakfast is ready . We can't wait any longer . Now hurry along , son ! Come right along ! Well , Ben , you sit there and ... Susan sits there and ... Thomas ! Thomas ! - Alright , Ma . - Come , sit right here next to me . Come on , Pa ! Pa , will you please say grace ? Our Lord , we give thee ... Just in time , Isaac . - Good morning , Isaac . - Good morning . Pa , I want to speak to you . - What's Isaac so serious about ? - Something's happened . I hope it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It's Johnny . - Johnny ? What's happened to him ? - He isn't hurt ! - He's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I don't believe you ! I can't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I'll show you . - I'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It's only a small fine . It isn't even serious . An officer was shot ! That's serious , isn't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny wouldn't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he's not upstairs ! And his bed hasn't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny's been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? - Why don't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you've got ? - None , to speak of . It's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything's going to be alright . - She's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Can't you see ? There isn't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you're not trying to do a thing . Why don't you talk to the lawyer ? - I haven't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you're shielding someone . - You're crazy . - I can't understand it . Did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't pay for it , did it ? I'll take it back . - I'm sorry about that . - It doesn't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , doesn't it ? Johnny , I don't believe you did it ! I won't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There's no doubt about that . Of course , it wouldn't have been so bad , only they took the car and don't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Don't you gamble your future on me . Don't wait . There're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I don't want you to come here again . I don't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they've done it . They've convicted him . Three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We've got to do something . We've got to ! We can't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I couldn't tell him anything . I always say : "" As ye sow , so shall ye reap "" . You can keep them old bars . I don't want them where I'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ain't got enough juice around here . Where they're gon na take me , they're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let's go . I'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You can't go on like this . I've got to , it's killing me . I can't eat , I can't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for me . - I'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I'll be away won't mean a thing . I'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you don't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he isn't . You'll always love him , stand by him , won't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll be hungry . You're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it's awfully hard to realize that Pa's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why don't you go and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I couldn't bring myself to give up the old home . I don't mind working , I like it . Besides , it's good for me . You're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why don't you ? I couldn't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why didn't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That's just why I didn't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I'm full right up to here . I've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I haven't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you're crying . I can't help it . I don't know what's the matter with me . Johnny , you haven't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I'm wrong , but I've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You can't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , can't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why don't you say that in the first place ? - Don't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I've got some great plans . I've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It won't be any time at all before I'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That's the tough part of it . I don't know how to tell her . - Why can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they wouldn't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered "" Jailbird "" . Johnny , you mustn't go . Don't you see ? I can't stay here . I'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma's getting old , Isaac . That's the tough part of it . Of course , I haven't made things any too easy for her . You haven't made the things too easy for any of us . It's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I'll send money for her every month . I'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Isn't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why didn't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac's been so worried about me , he thought it's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it's good to see you , Ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye . This is gon na be a full page ad for the world's greatest washing machine . You know , the old method in contrast with the new . I never thought I 'd stoop to this kind of work . It costs money to live in New York . All right , you can rest now , Ma . Answer the phone , will you , Ma ? Hello ? Just a moment , I'll see . - It's for Phyllis . - Call her , will you , Ma ? She's up in the roof with some girlfriends taking a sunbath . I'll call her . She wouldn't allow me up there . She says I'm too young . Phyllis ! Phyllis ! - What do you want ? - You're wanted on the telephone . How did you know I was over there ? Thomas told me you were up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You don't fool me , not for a minute . I'm on to you . Why , Phyllis ... I wouldn't ... You think I've done something wrong . Now , I suppose you think I've done something I shouldn't do , don't you ? Well , I haven't . I'll show you where you get off . I won't be spied upon by you or anybody else . I won't stand for it . - You're snooping , you're always snooping . - No , Phyllis , I wasn't . I know you want to cause trouble for me when you came here . - Well , you won't cause any more ! - Phyllis ! I don't care if you are his mother . He'll have to choose between you and me . If he wants you , all right , but he can't have us both . It's all right , Thomas , I don't mind at all . This is Phyllis's home and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young I felt just the same as she . Relatives are a nuisance . I feel terrible about this , Ma . No , Thomas , don't you worry at all . There's so much work for me to do with Susan . And I know Susan and Ben are anxious for me to visit them . - But are you sure you'll be all right ? - Of course I will , dear . - But she's my mother , Ben . - I know , but we can't do it . Why do you think we moved to this little apartment ? ' Cos we had to . We're losing money in the shop everyday . People aren't eating meat like they used to . Some of them go on a diet and don't eat meat at all . If this keeps up , I'll go broke . I've already had to fire the delivery boy . - She's willing to work . - She's too old to deliver meat . Where am I if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman like her . I like your Ma and I don't wan na be mean about it , but we've got to be sensible . Later on , if things break , business picks up , OK , gladly . - But ... where can she go , Ben ? - To Isaac's . He's got a big house , no trouble for him . Why should he pass the buck to us ?

Then I'm looking for a motion to move this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( many ) Aye . Opposed ? Motion carried . Next item . Restoration of the basketball rims in city park . Mr . Chavis , this is your request ? It is , Your Honor . Looks pretty straightforward to me . Um ... unfortunately , Mr . Chavis , we are not the jurisdictional body you need to be addressing . That would be the town Recreational Committee , which meets the first Tuesday of every month . I have , Your Honor . I beg your pardon ? I have submitted that request to the Rec Committee , but since it never holds a quorum in its meetings , it can't vote on that request . Well , better luck next month . Mr . Mayor , the Rec Committee has not held a quorum since 1964 , which , not coincidentally , was the year of the Federal Civil Rights Act . But , that may be , but there's nothing that we can do about that . Actually , there is , Your Honor . Based on the town charter , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of longer than six months , then it's possible for this council - - to call for a vote . Neil ? He is correct , Your Honor . But only if there is a quorum present at the time the vote is called . [clears_throat] Your Honor and everybody , I'm sorry , but I forgot I need to leave early tonight . I'm afraid I have to leave early as well , Your Honor . Well , that leaves us without a quorum . Adjourned . How 'd it go ? What was that Frederick Douglass quote your father was always so fond of reciting ? Power concedes nothing ... Without a demand . Yeah , well , I demanded . The power just rolled right over me . Well , I don't think Frederick Douglass expected the power to yield on his first attempt . [chuckles] I guess he didn't . Get some rest , son . Night , Momma . Pack of menthol Rx , please . What you trying to pull , boy ? They're - - for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that they're 35 cents . Why 'd you tell him these were for your momma ? For 35 cents , he 'd sell the baby Jesus a pack of smokes . He's got , like , 500 other - - ( Jebbie ) That was awesome . Sweet , man . What the heck ? Hey , what're you niggers doing in our neighborhood ? What're you doing ? Y'all better get your black asses out of here before we come over there and kick them out ! ( several ) Run ! ( Roseanna ) Hey ! You get home . Now . [sigh] Thank you , Roseanna . He was gon na kill me ! And why would that be ? Well , because Jebbie threw a rock at him . I didn't throw it ! Well , it didn't look like you did much to stop him . You go clean up . And get them cigarettes out your back pocket before your momma gets home . Thanks , Roseanna . Good night . ( Vernon ) See you tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking you on a trip , little buck . ( Daddy ) Whoo ! Come on ! Let's go ! Come on , Daddy ! Are you speaking to me ? Yeah ! Woo-hoo ! Daddy ? When are you gon na talk to me ? I'm not , little buck . I'm gon na show you something . What is it , Daddy ? It's a revival ! Tim . Tim . It's not a revival . ( man'svoice ) The light of Jesus . ( several ) For our God . The light of Jesus . ( several ) The light of Christ . The light of Jesus . Deliverance . We are the chosen one's . By the fire of Calvary's cross and the sentinel and the bearer of the light , jointly give birth to the star . For our God . For our God . Let the circles of light become alive . The light of Christ . We mean to cleanse and purify our virtues by burning out our vices from the fire of His word . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity . For our God . For our God . [cheering] I want to go , Daddy . Shh . ( faint ) Please , Daddy . I want to go home now . Let the circle truly become a living representation of our order in the darkness of the world . When I saw the cross , I thought everything was good . Evil can sometimes be hard to recognize . It hides in normal things . People you think you know . But recognizing evil isn't the hardest part . It's standing up to it , even when nobody else will . ( Dr.Proctor ) So essentially , the quality of our choices determine the quality of our lives . Which , translated , means you probably need to work a little harder . [whispering] Thank you . Dr . Proctor , my name is Reverend Vernon Tyson . Reverend Tyson . Please . I'm the pastor at the Oxford Methodist Church . I heard you preach last year at the North Carolina Council of Churches . You gave a magnificent speech . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wasn't the only reason you came to see me . So he said yes . And we'll get run out of town together . [chuckles] You might be right about that . Well , I think you're overreacting . I'm just saying there are people in this town who think that things have moved awfully fast in a very short time and maybe they should just - - slow down a bit . Well , if anybody bothered to ask the blacks in this town , they 'd tell you if things went any slower they 'd be going backward . At the very least don't you think you should've consulted with the Executive Committee before inviting him to speak ? Dr . Samuel Proctor is one of the leading educators in America . All the more embarrassing if you have to go back and tell him they won't let him preach . They ? Who is they ? You know full well who's they . They , who put bread on our table . [sigh] I know what I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll give me 24 hours notice to start packing . Bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies . [phone_ringing] May Your goodness and mercy be upon us and with those less fortunate . I n Your holy name . Amen . ( others ) Amen . No . I got it . Reverend Tyson . Oh , hello , John . Yes , as a matter of fact , we just sat down -- Yeah , sure , I 'd be happy to listen . I see . Un-huh . Well , I'm sorry you feel that way , but I'm afraid I can't do that . No . [phone_ringing] Reverend Tyson . ( @male_voice ) Is it true you invited a nigger to preach at our church ? Who is this ? ' Cause if it's true , you're gon na regret it . Who is this ? [dial_tone] [sigh] ( kids , [shouting] ) Fight ! Fight ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Tim Tyson ! What are you doing ? He called Daddy a nigger-lover . Your daddy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending him , Momma . I was trying not to be wicked . Wicked ? Daddy says the wickedest thing we can do is to do nothing . [sigh] Oh , honey . [ding] Dorothy . I came as soon as I heard . How's Joe ? He's gon na be okay . Thank God . Vernon ... he isn't gon na want to see you when he comes out . ( Martha ) Vernon ? ls that you ? Vernon ? Dick called . They scheduled an executive committee meeting tonight at 7:00 . What was I thinking , Martha ? Did I really believe I could change everything by myself ? You're not changing anything - - by yourself . I'm here . Stand your ground . Good evening , everyone . Reverend Tyson . Jack , Mr . Pink . Vernon . Dick . I'm assuming we're all here tonight because of my invitation to Dr . Samuel Proctor to speak this Sunday . Why would you do this , Vernon ? I got people coming into my store asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanting to know did we really invite a Negro preacher to stand in our pulpit ? And what did you tell them , Jack ? I told them they heard wrong . Ain't no Negro professor speaking in our church on Sunday . Oh , Jack , why in the hell would you say something like that ? ' Cause it's the truth , Thad ! Vernon , nobody's saying that it's perfect here , but we've got good relations with the Negro community . This might not be time to - - to stir things up . What time is a good time , Dick ? A year from now ? What , five years from now , Doug ? Does that sound about right ? Once your boys graduate high school ? Ten years from now ? Heck , this is starting to sound like work . Why don't we just leave it for the next generation to fix ? If this man speaks on Sunday , there will be a breach that will split this congregation . Is he worth tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can end this with one call , Vernon . Just call him and tell him don't come . We're living beneath a dam , gentlemen , a dam that's holding back 300 years of wrong . Now , you can say that dam ain't going to break all you want , but when the rains come and that dam bursts open and all that's bad comes flooding out , you won't have time to run for high ground . Now is the time . That's why I invited him . And that's why I'm not making that phone call . Well , that's all well and good , Vernon , but this is our church , and you don't have a right to do this . Well , actually , Jack , I do . And you gave it to me . This is the Methodist Book of Discipline . It defines the rules that govern our denomination . And it says - - "" the pastor of this church can determine the number and the nature of services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am still the pastor of this church . Now , if you see things differently , you give Bishop Grayson Tullis a phone call and you let him know . Otherwise , I have a job to do tomorrow , gentlemen . And I hope to see you all there . [organ_playing] Reverend Tyson ? You never asked me what I was going to speak about . No , sir . I didn't think that was my place . Thank you . Shall we face the lions ? [chuckles] I come to you today to talk about a problem of enormous magnitude . Something some of you would probably rather not hear about . But it is a subject that affects us . I am the president of North Carolina AT , a black university of approximately 4,000 -- I'll be right back . outstanding young men and women . Among our many fine accomplishments is our football program . The other day , my coach came in to see me . He told me that the finest running back he had ever seen is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brother both went to AT . But when my coach went down to recruit him , he say he ain't coming to AT . Said he's going to school over at Chapel Hill , says he's going to play for the Tarheels . They got the big school over there , big money , the big stadium , and he's going to play for them . Then my poor coach drove over to Kinston to see about this 300-pound offensive tackle they got at the Negro high school there . A fine young man , good grades , but he say he ain't coming to AT , either . That his mama wants him to play for N . C . State and wear the red and white of the Wolfpack . Well , when Coach finished , he looked at me defeated , and said , "" I'm sorry , but we're going to struggle "" next year on the football field and probably for years to come . "" I've never seen a sadder man . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" See , that's the problem with all this integration , Coach , that's just the price we're going to have to pay . "" [laughter] Our lesson today comes from the Book of John . Willie Mae ? You listening to the radio ? Willie Mae ? ( littlegirl , happily ) Daddy !

Further , I requested from him the assistance of State Troopers to help enforce this curfew . And most importantly , to restore a safe , secure , and law-abiding environment for the hearing tomorrow and for the trial in the months to come . All citizens my ass ! Damn right .

Because you broke some windows and stole some groceries ? They're not . You want to know why they're here ? They're here because last night , when you hit those streets , you took something more valuable than you could ever imagine . Something our families have been fighting for for years . I'm talking about equality . And they're not going to let you keep it without a fight . I ain't giving it back . Me , neither . Good . Mr . Chavis ! Mr . Chavis , where you going ? What's going on ?

You told Willie Mae that we was going to meet with the Governor when you knew he wouldn't see us , didn't you ? I told her the truth . I told her I notified his office that we were coming . You let her and her girls ride on top of that fake coffin for 50 miles , knowing that meeting wasn't gon na happen . That don't bother you ? You think Dickie Marrow's murder is the worst civil rights lynching ever ? It doesn't even come close to the things I've seen . And you think her pain is any different from the pain of those other families ? Now , what's special about his death is that it gives us an opportunity to make things better . Who do you think I am ? I'm not Dr . King . I'm not one of his golden boys . I'm a stoker , man . You understand ? They send me in to the towns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m just a stoker . ( anchormanoverTV ) In Raleigh today , groups of blacks marched in protest over the killing of a Negro Oxford man last week . Governor Scott's refusal to meet with black leaders has reportedly angered many of the marchers . Local police in Oxford continue to claim that the situation there is under control . Shit , man , put that damn thing out . Okay , now we sync watches . Sync on five , four , three , two , one . ( driver ) We got a call . Come on . [siren_wails] Let's go .

Ain't nothing gon na happen unless you make it . I've presided over several racially charged cases . I harbor no prejudice against Negroes . I was raised in a mainly black county . I ate with them . I played with them . We had an instinctive love for the Negro race . ( crowd ) Black power ! My secretary is black . That should show you how I feel about them . I have heard the arguments that this community is too turbulent for a trial . But I do not feel they present an adequate reason for moving these proceedings . [all_talking_at_once] Does it concern you that only 9 of the 100 juror candidates examined for this trial were black ? No . Why would that concern me ? Because Warren County , from which the jury pool is drawn , is in fact more than 2/3 black . This is a fair and impartial jury . And it'll be a fair and impartial trial . Mr . Burgwyn , is the prosecution ready ? Yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson to the stand . The deceased had two serious fractures of the skull , one on the top of his head , the other on the back . He also had bruises and abrasions all over his body , both .41 0 and 12-gauge shotgun wounds on the backs of his legs , as well as a .22-caliber bullet wound in the center of his forehead . I 'd been hanging with the fellas in the shed at the old fish market . Suddenly I hear Dickie and a white man arguing . That's when I saw Mr . Teel come out the store with a shotgun . And what did you do ? I ran ! I mean , we all ran . I heard about two or three shots . And , uh , then I came back . I saw Larry Teel standing over Dickie with a shotgun . I - - yelled at him . "" Stop before you kill that boy . "" Finally , I heard the shot . Who was holding the rifle , Mrs . Downing ? Who was holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Larry Teel . I was on my way to find everybody when Willie and Jimmie and them flew by me . Then I heard a shotgun blast . And after they beat him , what happened ? There was one more shot . Sounded like a cap pistol . [gunshot] No further questions , Your Honor . Boo , have you ever been in any trouble ? Legal trouble ? Yeah . But I ain't on trial . What kind of trouble ? Stuff . Receiving stolen goods , breaking and entering ? That kind of stuff ? Yeah , but I ain't killed nobody . I'm sorry . I didn't say you did . Did you serve time for those crimes ? Yeah . In fact , you're on probation right now , isn't that correct ? Yeah . Mr . Chavis , do you see the man that fired the shot that killed Dickie Marrow ? Yes . Will you get up and go over and touch him ? Yeah , sure . Please . Touch him . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense ready , Mr . Watkins ? Yes , we are , Your Honor . What did Dickie Marrow say to you ? He said , "" Hey , white girl . "" "" Hey , white girl . "" Huh . Had you said anything to him ? No , sir . And then what happened ? And then Larry told him , "" Don't be speaking to her like that . "" And then he came at Larry with a knife , and I screamed for help . ( LarryTeel ) He said , "" Hey , white girl . Hey , you bitch . "" I said , "" Don't talk to my [wife] like that . "" And he said , uh , "" Come on , I'm a soul brother . "" Then he pulled his knife on me . After he went down , what happened ? I hit him with my fists , took the knife away from him , then stood up . The rifle that shot him . Were you holding the rifle ? No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking down at him on the ground . Did you recognize the other men ? It was happening so fast . The boy attacked me . And I ran after him -- Larry - - did you recognize the other men ? My father was there . I recognized his voice when he said , "" I'm gon na call an ambulance and the police . "" And what about the other man ? I didn't know who he was . ( anchormanoverTV ) ln a surprise move here Thursday , Larry Teel , son of a local barber , Robert Teel , took the witness stand in Granville County Superior Court and denied that he shot and killed a local Negro man . ( Watkins ) Were you holding the rifle ? ( Larry ) No , sir . ( Watkins ) Did you see who was holding it ? So tell me , Roger , one more time , what happened . I heard Judy call for help . I ran after my father . When I got to the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Did Larry Teel at any time that night have a gun in his hand ? No . Then how could that last shot have been fired ? Roger ? I was holding it . Someone bumped my shoulder , and the gun went off . [weeping] I didn't mean to kill anybody . It was an accident . No further questions , Your Honor . ( attorney ) lf this was an accident , why did you let your father and brother stand trial for first-degree murder ? ' Cause my lawyers told me not to say nothing . Do you mean to tell this jury that you let them sit in jail without the privilege of bond for three months , and didn't tell anybody that you shot this man or that it was an accident ? Your father and your brother were on trial for their lives ! For their lives ! And you have not set foot in this courtroom until today ! My attorney told me not to come . That boy lay on the ground begging for his life , helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kicking him . And did you beat him with the stock of that rifle , Roger ? His skull was fractured . Did you hit him with it ? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me . Who told you to say that ? Who told you to plead the Fifth Amendment ? My lawyers . Mr . Watkins . And did they tell you that all the witnesses had testified that Larry was holding the gun ? And that if you said that you shot the rifle and that it was an accident , that your father and brother might not have to go to prison ? I refuse to answer on the -- Your brother shot that boy , didn't he , Roger ? ! And you and your daddy helped kill him , didn't you ? They let you stay home with your [wife] and your baby . Now you're supposed to help them and say that you shot him because they know there isn't a witness anywhere that can testify to that effect . Nobody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can testify against you . But I'm sure they told you that , too , didn't they , Roger ? No further questions . [hubbub_of_voices] ( femalevoices ) Lieutenant Williams , why wasn't the third man indicted ? There was a third party mentioned from time to time during the investigation , but none of my witnesses were able to make a positive identification of a third person , and they all saw the defendant , Larry Teel , fire the fatal shot . [clears_throat] Three men beat Dickie Marrow while he helplessly begged for his life , more than a hundred feet off of their property . First they shot him as he was running away , and then , when he was flat on his back , they beat him , and they kicked him . And they stomped him and hit him in the head with a shotgun butt over and over . Then they put a bullet in his head , just like you or I would kill a snake , and they called it self-defense . Then , after the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of the imagination an act of self-defense , they came up with a new story . An accident . Or what they might call - - accidental self-defense . Of course , there is no such category , ladies and gentlemen , and nothing remotely like that happened . This case is one of the most serious cases ever to be tried in this state . And the outcome will affect events in this community , the state of North Carolina , and across the nation . We can not tell the world that we have one system of justice for Negroes and another for whites . We must face the truth and we must act upon it or be damned by our lies forever . [baby_crying] ( @female_voice ) Shh shh shh . [baby_gurgles_quietly] I - - I hear that baby cry , and I can't help but think about a little girl going to have to grow up now without knowing her father . And I can't help but hear that cry as a cry from Dickie Marrow , saying , "" Don't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world it was an accident . Please ! - Don't let them do that to me . "" And if you do , ladies and gentlemen , well , you may as well hang a wreath on the courthouse door on the way out , because you just as clearly say to the world that justice is dead - - in Granville County .

Why is there only one African-American on the police force and none on the fire department ? [indistinct] , grocery store workers -- Yet we make up 40% of the population of this county . Why ? Why do we do what we do every day in this town ? Fear ? Tradition ? No , that's not good enough , not anymore .

Frank , we can take care of all this . You bet we can . We're through , finished . I don't want a bum for a partner , not me . F-Frank . Hey , Frank ! Frank ! [Retching] I'm so sorry , lo . I didn't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I've said it before , but I swear ... Lo , after tonight , I will never ... Stop it ! I don't want to hear any more promises or apologies . I can't take this anymore , bill . It's not just the drinking . It's simple , common decency . And when you've lost that , where does it end ? [Coughing] Ebby ! Hey ! I can't reach Frank . Where is he ? How bad is it ? Everybody's getting called in . Their margins are being closed all over town . Got ta get to a phone . Good luck . I'm not going down with everybody else . I can tell you that . Hey , tom ! I need a phone . Can you help me ? They're all tied up . You must have something . Use the one in the back room . Great . Thanks . I won't forget . Excuse me . Oh , damn . Aha ! Operator , yes , give me bowling green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes ? Oh , thanks . Hello ? Oh , Nate , good man . Right where I need you . Where's Shaw ? Huh ? Thank you . Uh-huh . How bad is it ? Uh-huh . So what can we salvage ? Uh-huh . Ok , listen . Dump the Portland and the g.E . Sell emerson only if you have to . Please tell dink to stop pushing it so hard . Yeah . You're a good man . Bye . Oh , man , it's hot in here . Sid , hi . Bill Wilson . Yeah , boy , I know . Well , there's always a port in a storm , and have I got one ... Penick and Ford . It's a safe bet . Solid . Solid as a rock . Yeah , well ... Yeah . Sure . Hey , no problem , sid . Yeah . Next time . Right . God damn ! I called everywhere , ebby . No one's seen him at all . He was here before . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he's gone now . You are not notifying me , dink ! But Nate said we have a couple of hours . He said two or three hours ! No , you're not ! Dink , you're ... Hello ? Din ... [doorbell_buzzes] Yes , who is it ? This is your landlord , Mrs . Wilson . Bill , honey ? Bill , come up . Please . I said it's your landlord . I have bad news for you . You're being dispossessed the first of the month . It's over ! Bill ? You hear me ? It's over ! [Muttering] Bill ! [Horn_honks] [Honk] [Honk] Bill ! Bill , come back . Please ! Please come back ! Bill ! Bill ! Come on , old-timer , watch your step . Get in . I'll go in first , ok ? Remember , it's only temporary , until you can get back on your feet ... And get well . [Horn_honks] We both appreciate this , father . And there won't be any problems , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he's still drinking , but he keeps trying . He really does . Oh . Trying , my God . A little spunk , that's all it takes . I ... I keep alcohol in the back office . Should I lock it up ? Yes , but it won't make any difference . Lois , why do you put up with it ? Because I see things in him that he can't see in himself , wonderful things . He wants to stop , and I want to help . But you have tried and you have tried . Just how much longer ? Well , if we can just find Adele . Good morning . Ah , here she is . Good morning , Adele . This is Lois . Lois Wilson . It's good to meet you . Adele gentry manages our children's wear . She'll show you the ropes . Any more questions , you know where to find me . And remember , it's guy , not Mr . kolb . Thank you . He's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just keep your girdle on and your collar buttoned . [Banging] [Drunken_rambling] Look at this . Oh ... Oh , what a mess . Look at this . I can't believe ... Trying to get my hat . It's ok . Trying to get my hat . Let's get him upstairs . I have something that will help him . You big palooka . Stop , ugh . Lois ... oh , God . I love you . I don't care about anything except you . Please , get out of this now . This will quiet him down . You don't deserve it . Just get out . Get away from me . Just get away from it all . He's right , darling . Get out of this now . For your own good . You can't help him anymore . Lois , don't leave me . I need you . Don't leave me , please . Father moved out when mother died , and it's just gotten more difficult to manage . So you 'd like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here what , a year and a half now ? You're the most cheerful person on the floor , and you go home every night to a drunk . I had no idea . I just wanted you to know why ... Does he ever sober up ? He's sober now . He goes a whole month sometimes . A woman like you shouldn't have to measure out her life like that . Want my advice ? You chain that guy to a radiator . Go out and have some fun . How about some dinner ? Maybe a little dancing ? I just asked you for a raise . That's all . If I can't have it , just say so . Bill . How are you ? It's a struggle , Frank , but we're making it . That about describes all of us these days . So , what can I do for you ? I got another winner for you , Frank . I got a really big winner . It's ... [Clearing_throat] A company in new Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real steal . Seems interesting . Uh ... It's a good one . Look , bill , here's a small advance until I have time , to study it further . Don't worry , Frank . I'll trust you for the balance . Well , I'm sorry . I've got to run . I've got people in the office . No problem , Frankie . Frank ... You'll ... You'll like this . Psst . Psst . Psst . Psst . Lo ? Where are you going ? You have to leave . I'm working . Not anymore you're not . Here , look at this . Look , uh ... Please , be quiet . We need someone from security in the children's department . We can get out of here , you can pack it in . What are you talking about ? I can't quit . Come on . This way . Why ... why not ? Why not ? May I help you , sir ? I'm talking to my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my God ! You grab his head , I'll take his nose . It's paraldehyde , buddy boy . Come on . Down the hatch . It will stop the shakes . How is he , Dr . silkworth ? The contusions and bruises will heal . It's the other condition that alarms me . Condition ? His liver isn't cirrhotic , but it's badly swollen . He's in the early stages of delirium tremens , the shakes , and quite possibly he may have some brain damage . Brain damage . Oh , my God . I've seen a lot of men like bill . I've got a theory not too popular with my fellow doctors . Excessive drinking is a disease , an allergic addiction . It's got nothing to do with a lack of willpower or moral fiber . Some people can't be temperate drinkers . I told this to bill . What good is knowing it if he can't stop ? I know , but he has to . Otherwise , you're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he's to stay sane or alive . The way he's going , he can't last the year . I'm glad you're home . How are you feeling ? All right , I guess . Can I ask you something ? I guess I've been afraid . Does it have anything to do with me ? Your drinking ? No . It's not you . It's me . Why ? Why do you do it to yourself ? I've been standing here all afternoon asking myself the same question . Why ? I look out the window , and I watch all the normal people walking by . It's funny , I don't think I've ever felt really normal all my life , I mean , like other people . I feel differently somehow , like I don't quite measure up . Ever since I can remember I've had this feeling ... Deep down in my gut . Scared . I see people ... [Laughing] . At ease with each other . I'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't be accepted . And then ... Overseas , I found that a drink ... A few drinks makes me feel comfortable , like I always want to feel . It gives me courage ... To be with people , do things . To dream . The money , the success , the respect , it was all good for a while , but it never seems enough . I always want doubles of everything to make me feel alive , worthwhile inside . But then ... That all began to slip away . I feel cheated . Angry . Always so full of fear , so I drink ... More ... And it makes it ok for a while . I convince myself that things will turn around , tomorrow , soon , that I'll make it all up for you , but it only gets worse . I ... I keep promising you , others , myself , that's it , no more , going on the wagon . That's it ! And I think I mean it , but ... But the guilt ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror ... Or ... At you . Especially you . Especially at you . I've stopped believing in everything . People ... God ... Mysel ... myself . I know it sounds insane , Lois , but in spite of all this ... What I want right now more than anything else is another drink . Have a seat . Mr . partlin will be right with you . Thank you . I'm sorry I'm late . Thank you for coming . I don't think I could do this alone . I had no idea things had gotten this bad , Lois . When I stopped by to see you at the store last week ... You know I 'd do anything for bill ... And you . I only wish it wasn't this . I almost wound up in a place like this . You look so much better . How long have you been sober ? Almost four months . What's your secret ? How did you do it ? I got religion . Mrs . Wilson ? Yes . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr . Thatcher , a close friend of ours . May I show you our facilities ? This way , please . [Man_moaning] Don't be alarmed , Mrs . Wilson . He's not in real pain . More imagined than physical . Here , we can tell the difference . Alcoholics ... They imagine things , see things , if you know what I mean . Dr . silkworth tells me your husband has been drunk for more than three months . Does he still have bowel and bladder control ? Yes , of course . He's not ... Yes , certainly , Mrs . Wilson , but we have to ask , you understand . I wanted to show you our sun room . [Coughing] The admitting office will answer your questions about the legal procedures for committing your husband . I hope I've helped . You have . Thank you . Please forgive me , but I have a patient to see . Oh , you'll have to leave the way we came in . These doors are locked . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . If you've found something that works , you have to talk to him . One thing I've found , Lois , is you can't help somebody that doesn't want help . But you have to try . I know bill wants it . Please talk to him . Please . I will . I'll give him a call . [Doorbell_buzzes] [Buzz] Ebby . Ebby , come in . Come in . Let me take your hat . Sorry . I was , uh ... Just getting dressed when you phoned . Oh , out of the blue . God ! Ha ! How you been , ebby ? Huh ? Why haven't we heard from you ? I was in pretty bad shape . I guess didn't want anyone to see me ... Even you . Oh , a man on ... whom the sun never sets . Let's go get us a little pick-me-up . Boy . Sit down . We got a lot of catching up to do . Here we go . A little gin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can't drink gin ? I don't drink anything anymore . I gave it up . Come on , ebby . Come on . Just one little hooker . No . I found a way to stay sober , bill . Well , here's a toast ... To whatever it is you found ... And to old times , if that's ok with you . Bill ... Let me tell you about this ... So what's this thing you found , ebby ? Huh ? Dame ? No . Actually , it's a ... It's a form of religion . Oh , cripes . Well , I just finally threw in the towel . I hit bottom . I admitted I was licked . What brand of religion did you buy , ebby ? It's no special brand . It's called the Oxford group . We have meetings . We try to be absolutely honest with ourselves . We pray . You pray ? Yes , and we reach out to others . It keeps me sober and alive . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all those people . Ministers ... Priests ... I just can't swallow the way they peddle God . If you don't buy their God , then you choose your own . It begins by admitting that there's a power , whatever you want to call it , that's greater than ourselves . Now you listen to me , ebby . I know you're from an old family , but I didn't know you were on the guest list of the last supper . You might just think about it , bill . That's all . Can't hurt . I know you ... I know you mean well , ebby . You stay in touch , ok ? Bill ... If you ever need to talk ... Yeah . [Door_closes] Bill ? Are you home ? Is that you in there ? No . It's the crazy man you think you're gon na put away in some sanitarium . But ... but you're not going to . Not bill Wilson , you're not . Just ... Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who am I ? Who am I ? Don't you even recognize me anymore ? I'm Lois burnham Wilson , the wife of a helpless , hopeless , drunken sot , a selfish , sick alcoholic who's kept me imprisoned in this dismal sanitarium for more years than I care to remember . Who am I ? I am your nurse , your caretaker , your cleaning lady ! When all I ever wanted to be was your wife . I let you drag me down with you , deprive me of love , warmth , friendship , even common decency ! But I won't go on with it anymore . I can't ! If you want to die , die ! But I won't let you take me down with you . I want to live . I'm going to live . I'm ... I'm going to live ! [Sobbing] I'm going to live . I'm not ... I'm not crazy ! Not going to put me away . I'm not crazy . Not crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , man ! Why don't you watch where you're going ? You bum ! [Brakes_screech] [Horn_honks] Hey ! Get out of the street ! You want to get killed ? What's the matter with you ? You , too ! You don't know what you're talking about ! Hey . Hey , you ok , buddy ? I want ... I want to ... I ... I need to ... I ... I want ... No ... No ... Oh ... Oh ... Something happened . What is it ? All I remember is ... I was asleep ... And yet I wasn't . I had this terrible fear ... Sense of dread ... That I was ... Going out of my mind , dying . And yet I wouldn't let go ... Couldn't . And then ... How do I explain this ? The room was filled with light ... From out there . And I was at peace . A kind of comfort I have never known before . And then the light was gone ... But the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not another hallucination , the condition of a damaged brain . From the look of you , bill , right now , I 'd say no . But , well , I'm a man of science . I don't pretend to understand something like this . Whatever happened , hang on to it . It's so much better than what you had yesterday . Ahh ... I know I keep saying it , Lois , but I can't tell you how different I feel . I can taste again and feel and smell . I'm alive . Really alive . I haven't felt this way in years . You are different . I can tell . I called ebby this morning and told him . He understood . He said in order to keep it , I've got to share it . Gave me a lot to think about . Think about this . What about this ? Ha ha ha ! Watch your step . A little soup sound good now ? I'm still dizzy . Hey , ebby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent the past few days in bellevue . He could use a good meal . Take him in the kitchen . Make him feel at home , ok ? Eb ? His teeth are in his left front pocket . Where's Lois ? She's upstairs . I think she's pretty done in . You're not asleep yet . Good . Maybe we can talk a minute . Bring home another convert ? Yeah . I think this one's serious about not drinking , though . He's been through the mill and back again . That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about , lo . You still working and all and this added burden ... Cooking and cleaning after all these guys I bring home . I mean , it's a lot to ask , isn't it ? If it's what you really want to do ... How am I ever going to make things up to you ? You keep giving , and I keep taking . Maybe ... Maybe someday . I've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have , too . Bill ! Bill ! Bill , we need your help . That new guy's going berserk ! He's throwing things and threatening Al . I'll be right back . They need me , Lois . Let them handle their own problem for once . Go to your fool drunks . I should know by now who comes first . He's not the man you knew . He feels he has a mission . He finds drunks and tries to help them out . He brings them home . That can't be easy on you , Lois . Well , especially not now . Unfortunately , not one of them has remained sober ... Except bill , of course . And , well , I think he's getting pretty depressed about the whole thing . How long's he sober now ? Five months . That part must be great for you . I mean , really being together again . Yes , it's better , but ... Oh , it's not him . It's me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now it's not what I expected it would be . Is he working ? Does he need a job ? That's really why I came to see you . I thought if we could resume our lives ... Sort of a new beginning ... Well , some investors I know have a situation in akron . Something bill's good at ... A proxy battle . That sounds wonderful . Thank you . Maybe if you tell me I'll understand . I thought you 'd be grateful for this chance . It's a little late for gratitude , isn't it ? What do you mean ? My whole damn life ! Zero . Even these past five months ... Hauling bums to salvation . Where did it get me ? They're all still drunk . And me ? Well ... It wasn't a bad thing to do . What did it prove ? That you can stay sober . Sober ? What's sober ? All that proves is I'm still a drunk who doesn't drink . Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why don't you wait another day ? I can't wait another day ! The investors want me in akron tomorrow for the proxy fight . You're afraid I'll get drunk . It's written all over your face . Put your mind at rest . I didn't say that . Put your mind at rest ! I've had my last drink , Lois ! I'm not going back to it ... Ever . No . It's still going badly , Frank . I'm having trouble getting on the inside . These akron steel folk are pretty conservative . No , I can't say how much longer . Oh , I'll give it a few more days , but it doesn't look so hot right now . Yeah . Ok . Sure . You , too , Frank . Bye . Excuse me . I've got some time on my hands . I'm awaiting the outcome ... Well , anyway ... Are there any tours ? Anything to see in akron ? There's the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not much else , really . I suppose I could always go to a movie . The rialto's just down the street . Thank you . Sir , what's your pleasure ? Nickels . Can I have some nickels ? Nickels ? Sure . Yes , can I speak to the reverend Holland , please ? Yeah , I'll wait . Reverend Holland , I got your name off the ... Well , I'm a stranger in town . I'm a drunk , an alcoholic , and I need to talk to another drunk . Can you tell me where I could find one ? I know it sounds peculiar . No , no , I'm not drunk ! I said I have to talk to another drunk . Ah . Oh , oh . Well , thank you anyway . Is father John peestrock there , please ? When will he be back ? Thank you very much . "" Reverend Walter tunks . "" Thank you , reverend tunks , thank you . Yeah , 5 P.M . , the gatehouse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The name of the man I'm to meet is Robert Smith ? Dr . Robert Smith . Yes , I have it all . Thank you again . Wilson . Bill Wilson . I'm from New York , here in town on some business . I really appreciate reverend tunks and Mrs . seiberling getting us together like this . I'm not really feeling too well today , Mr . Williams . Bit of a headache . I told henrietta I couldn't spend too much time , but as an accommodation , I 'd ... Strange you should be a doctor . My father-in-law was a doctor . I don't mean to rush you , Mr . Williams , but ... Wilson . Wilson . Oh , I'm sorry , Mr . Wilson . Yes . The reverend tunks and henrietta are ... Good friends . They're caring people , and it's because of them that I ... Well . Look , I ... I've had more than my share of , uh , help , you might say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider my problem personal . I don't ask help from well-meaning strangers . Doctor , I'm a ... No , listen to me , Mr . Wilson . The best have tried their wares on me ... Medical men , psychiatrists , ministers . I've been prayed over and carved up more than a Christmas Turkey . So just what do you think a man like you could do for me ? Dr . Smith , I didn't come here to help you . I came here to help me . [Laughing] And on that occasion , I was so hung over I turned in three empty exam books and was summarily asked to leave medical school . [Knock_on_door] Oh , henrietta . I was only going to give this mug 15 minutes . But is it ok if we stay a while longer ? Of course . I'm in no hurry if Mr . Wilson isn't . Mr . Wilson , I can't thank you enough . We're just jawboning , Annie . That's all , nothing more . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for me . They mean well , but ... We got to do it for ourselves . Oh , I've tried that . Once I was on the wagon for two years , but I always came back to it . Then one day I stayed . I don't mean by ourselves . I mean for ourselves ... Together . You mean , two drunks helping each other ? Of course , I didn't want to admit it at the time , but I could actually see the light in his eyes . [Clock_chimes] Uh-oh . Good grief . I 'd better get Annie home before she flays me alive . Are you busy tomorrow ? Not too busy for this . It's what our lives have to be about from now on ... Staying off the booze . When I think about what I threw away ... 10 years ago , I was one of the best doctors in the state . I had a wonderful practice , I was respected by my peers . Now ... I know . Believe me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . The strangest feeling , yet a ... A calm , safe kind of feeling . You really understood . I like that . Sure this is ok with Anne ? Me in your spare room , the star boarder ? Anne is delighted . I'll bet the coffeepot's perking already . I'll tell Lois what happened , that we'll be here a while longer . I got it . Nah , you just lead the way . "" Smitty and I have discovered more together "" these past four weeks "" than I learned through my months of failure "" back in New York "" when I was trying to shove religion down the throats of those poor , confused , and unwilling drunks . "" He adds a few personal things . He says to give you his very best and he'll keep in touch . Keep in touch . I only heard from him one time since he's been out there . Ebby , what's wrong ? I know you miss bill . So do I . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I'm all right . Really , Lois , I'm fine . It's just one of those down days , I guess . It might work , bill . It never occurred to me to help others as a way of staying off it myself . But it can't be like my New York experience . I gathered up guys like these , dragged them home , lectured them , preached at them . A real Bible thumper . Here you go . Thanks . It just didn't work . Getting preached at would ruffle my feathers , too , even though I'm a believing man . Maybe that's the secret . Do just as you did with me ... Shared your booze experience . No preaching . Smitty , look . See ? That makes you realize that drunks care for each other . Drunk or sober , there is a bond . Buddies on the stormy sea of booze . We'll start with guys who are ready to admit they've had enough and help them find a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they are , where they're from , how much they make , none of that means a damn thing . And they shouldn't fear being found out . We've got to promise they'll be anonymous . Every drunk should feel like we do together ... Safe , secure . We haven't been at this very long , but it's working for us . How about we find someone else to try it out on ? I'm game . It's good to see you , Dr . Smith . How've you been ? Sober . I'm glad . You look very good . Mr . dotson's in room 1204 . He knows you're coming , but he's not in good shape . He struck a nurse the other night . He's vicious when he's drunk . Well , thanks for your help , Meg . Take care . Thank you . Hi . I'm Bob Smith . Bill dotson . Bill did you say ? My name's bill , too . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s also a drunk . We're both drunks . Alcoholics . I hit a nurse last night , a young woman . She was just trying to help . Well , we know how you feel . We've both done terrible things , things that ... That we're ashamed of . Would you like to get off it , bill , stop drinking ? If you think you could lick it all by yourself , stay dry the rest of your life , that would be great . We found we couldn't ... Not alone we couldn't . We think we can do it together . How long have you been dry ? About seven months now . A few weeks . You some kind of religious people ? No . We're just drunks like you . Well , we know you're not feeling too well . We 'd be happy to come back tomorrow and talk about it , you know , if you're ... Well , bill . Goodbye , bill . Goodbye , bill . I ... Hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow ? You bet . Ebby ! Thanks for coming to meet me . Have I got a lot to tell you . Let's grab a taxi . Ebby , something great happened in akron . It could be what we've been looking for . Come on . I'll tell you about it . Taxi ! [Horn_honks] [Honk] Ebby , you're drunk . No . No . I just don't feel so good . Why ? In heaven's name , why ? Be-because I ... I don't know . I guess I just felt that ... No . No . It's stupid . What ? Tell me . It used to be you and me . Practically all our lives , you and me . Then Lois told me about you and that Dr . Smith , about all that work you were doing with him , and it wasn't you and me anymore . That's not true ! If you 'd called , I would have been back . It'll always be you and me , pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober . Ha ! Well , I'm glad one of us made it . You'll make it , ebby . Look , we're going to start getting together , people like you and me . Having meetings . There's so much to do . I'll need your help . Yeah . That's ... That's not what I need right now . You ... you know what I need . No . Ebby , don't . Eb ... Ebby ! Ebby , no ! Ebby ! Still thinking about ebby ? I'm sorry , lo . This is my homecoming . I'm nuts to louse it up . Anything wrong ? You went out there for a few weeks and stayed four months . You came to visit . For a week . And I loved it , but akron isn't our home . It was something I needed to do . Tell me something . Now that you're sober , why are we drawing so much further apart ? It isn't just me . Be honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't know how I feel anymore . Can you say why ? Neither can I . It's strange . I used to think , being a drunk , that one day I 'd just quit , be rid of it , and then I 'd feel different , better . No more knots inside . What I know now is that I will never be rid of it , and I'll spend the rest of my life dealing with it , facing the truth about myself , and trying to make it better . When I saw ebby today , it made me realize that not drinking is the most important thing in my life . It's the only thing I really care about , can think about . Including our marriage ? I found out what I have to do not to drink . In my case , I have to be with other drunks . You tried that before . I'll try it again because I know now it really works . I don't know where that leads to , but it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s what I'm going to do ... Absolutely . You're right about this one-day-at-a-time stuff . Hell , after I broke my sixth pledge , I broke Barney Stein's jaw . Now he won't let me drink in his stinking poolroom anymore . He's doing you a big favor , arty . Look , I got three months now . My wife called me yesterday . She might want me back , being sober and all . Trouble is , one look at my mother-in-law , and I'll be drunk again . Not so , Mike . I have to believe that if bill here can stay sober , any of us can . Charley's right , Mike . If what Dr . Bob and I found can work for this drunk , it can work for anybody . By the way , the meetings in akron and Cleveland are getting bigger and bigger every day , much like our experience here in New York . Which brings me to a point . Hank and I found this building on 24th street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Lois happier , too . The only problem is there's going to be rents , expenses ... Maybe we ought to have dues . Some can't afford it . They could afford to drink . Some drunks get awful cheap when they sober up . Well , passing the basket's worked so far . Besides , things are looking up . The book I wrote with a lot of help from all of you about our a.A . Experience , how it works , is getting attention from the public and the press . Told you my promotions would pay off . Dr . Bob's coming next week for an interview that Hank set up with the Saturday evening post . [Applause] You're going to be big shots . Anonymous big shots , Artie . The writer's agreed to use only our first names . That's ok . We just hope it helps spread the word . Ok , is that it ? I guess that's it , except to say thanks for keeping me sober one more day . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can always make room . I need volunteers so Lois doesn't yell at bill . [Door_opens] Lo ? I was wondering where you were . I've been out walking since I left work . It's after 10:00 . Did a lot of walking ... And a lot of thinking . What about ? Us mostly ... And other things . Like what ? Like ... Will things ever be normal between us ? Will you ever get a regular job and come home at night for dinner ? Will we have a home ? We could be dispossessed with all the bills piling up . Will our lives ever be simple , balanced ... Like other people ? I don't know . Nor do you seem to care . I care , Lois . It's just that I could never go back to ... To the way it was . It may have had some satisfactions for you ... Wait . Wait . Are you ... Saying I wanted you drunk all those years , all that heartache ? Not consciously , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life . You stayed with that . You're saying that I wanted you drunk ? You ... You ... I can't believe this . Maybe I should start drinking . Then I 'd get the same consideration you give your alcoholic friends ! You being sober , it's what I prayed for , but I prayed that it would also include me . Maybe it never will . This story is wonderful . It'll carry the a.A . Message to so many people . Today the Saturday evening post , tomorrow time magazine . They called . They want to do a cover story . Can you beat that ? I thought only presidents and babe Ruth made the cover of time . You know ? Our plane has finally taken off . I think we should keep our feet planted firmly on the ground . Flap your wings a bit . You deserve it . Bill , you and I know from hard experience that the alcoholic has no tolerance for the limelight . That's why we harp on anonymity . Not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep our darn fool egos under control . It's that simple . That's what we've got to remember , Billy . Always keep it simple . Always . You bet . Just keep putting one foot in front of the other . One day at a time . Now , don't you keep Lois waiting . On your way . Goodbye , smitty . Goodbye , old friend . We've come a long way , haven't we , lo ? Who ever could've dreamed of all the things that have happened ? Well , you always wanted to be somebody . Now you are . Careful of my humility . Oh , what humility ? There , look at that . There is civilization in California . Just 26 more Miles . Good . We'll have time to bathe and eat . Shall we get some coffee ? Uh , yeah . We have time . Uh , howdy . Oh , hi . Welcome to our a.A . Group . I'm Zack . Just visiting ? Tourists , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From New York . This is my wife Lois . Hello . Lois . Pete , norene . I 'd like you to meet bill and his wife Lois . Bill w . How do you do ? Ellen . Yeah ? Bill and Lois . Hi , bill . Hi . Hi . Have you been around before ? Oh , no , they're just traveling through . Been in the program a while , bill ? You might say that . How long ? Well , since 1935 . 1935 ? I didn't know it went back that far . You must've known some early members . Matter of fact ... Yes , he did . I did . Back east ? In New York . Didn't it begin there ? Yes , that's where we ... No , it didn't , Pete . It was akron , Ohio . You sure ? Positive . We're glad to have you and your wife visiting . Get a seat now . The meeting's going to start . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats now . Please take a chair . Take your places . Well , before we close , if anyone has anything else they 'd like to share , now is the time . In that case , after a moment of silence , we'll close with the serenity prayer . [Raps_podium] God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , the courage to change the things I can , and the wisdom to know the difference . Keep coming back . It works . It works . That was a nice meeting . Hmm . [Insects_chirping] I love the west , little towns like this . What makes that noise , locusts ? I don't know . I don't know . Are you upset because they didn't recognize you ? No . Oh , maybe just a little bit . I'm going to get some coffee . Do you want some ? No , thanks , sweetheart . Cicadas . What ? Them insects . They're cicadas . Thanks . My name is bill . Fred . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some doubts . Well , I only come ' cause the missus walked out on me and took the kids . Says she ain't coming back unless I make an effort . You know , maybe this meeting wasn't enough for you . Could you use another one ? Just you and me . I want my kids back . It's like any journey , Fred . It begins with the first step . I thought you might like some anyway . Thanks , lo . Fred ? Yeah . I may be a while . Is this ok ? I'll be waiting back at the motel . Thanks , lo . I'll be there . I lost part of my family once long ago when I was drinking , and then after I got sober , I gained so much more back . How long have you been drinking ? Since I was 17 . That sounds about right . Yeah . Did it click the first time you had a drink ? Did it click ? Yeah . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yeah ... Been going downhill ever since that click . Yeah . But this is it , I mean ... My boys . How many boys you got ? I got two boys . Two boys . They're 6 and 9 . Oh , you're very lucky .

"@@3587666 # Time and space are not homogeneous . In the life of every civilization , every country , every nation and every person there are special places and special points of time - unusually important , crucial points . In my life this special moment , which I'll never forget , happened in Moscow , Russia , in the spring of 1992 , right after the fall of Communism . I came back to my native town after 17 years of forced separation . Moscow was in turmoil , so was I . Allow me to introduce myself : Alexander Greenberg . That spring I was turning 50 - time to gather stones . And it just so happened that at an International Congress on the "" structure of the universe "" was taking place in Moscow at the moment . I am an astrophysicist , so are most of the people important for me . My entire tiny little world was getting together in the city of my youth . So I've decided to come to the city to face my past and to reevaluate my life . At the point it seemed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Not only my own life but also life of all the other beings populating our planet . After lunch we will begin our regular sessions , but right now , before we take a break , we would like to show you a short film . This film is not a scientific film , but it does include some footage of our space research , as well as some visual references abstracted from the works of numerous astrophysicists . May we have the shades drawn , please . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Let me introduce to you the main characters of our story . That woman who keeps looking my way is Helen . She is my wife . Or , if you prefer , ex-wife . In any event , she is always threatening to leave me . I need a life . I need a real life before I am too old . What's so bad about our life ? You call this a life ? Right ! SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And sometimes she does leave , for a time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking seems to worry her . Well , she had never seen me drinking so much before . The creator of the film you are about to see , Jill Stratton , is with us today . Do you see the beautiful lady standing by the camera ? That is miss Stratton herself . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : "" The beautiful lady standing by the camera "" is my lover , Jill . Not that we're really lovers . Not now , anyway . Sasha , what's the matter ? I don't understand . Don't you ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And that is Natasha . In a way , she is also my lover . Ex . Go . Leave Russia . Your place is out there . What about you ? What about me ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Even though we are very old friends , our intimate relationship was brief . As for the past seventeen years , we not only haven't seen each other , but have not even corresponded . But I didn't correspond with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by darkness , I would like to read a brief passage from John Milton's "" Paradise Lost "" . In this passage , the angel Raphael is speaking to Adam and Eve . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The imposing gentleman at the podium , is my professor , Doctor Gross . I have not seen Henrich Gross for the past 17 years either . "" ... To ask or search I blame thee not ; for Heaven Is as the Book of God before thee set , Wherein to read his wondrous works , and learn His seasons , hours , or days , or months , or years . the rest from Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal , to move His laughter at their quaint opinions wide Hereafter , when they come to model Heaven , And calculate the stars . "" SASHA ( @voice_over ) : I remember one of my last meetings with Gross before I left Russia . Continue your cosmological research for God , and make the bomb - for Caesar . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of his choice kept calculating the stars for God and building bombs for the Caesars of our choice . In the past two decades , a microscopic flash of time , we have been able to reveal so many secrets of the Great Architect that we can not look at footage reflecting the results of this change without utter fascination . It is debatable how long the Great Architect can continue to conceal his secrets . If we may remind him of the old saying : "" He who laughs last laughs longest . "" SASHA ( @voice_over ) : As in the old days Gross was challenging God himself . I must admit , I was surprised to see how little he has changed . Perhaps he has discovered the fountain of youth . The city beyond the windows is my city , although until the commencement of our story I have been away from it for seventeen years . I was born in this city , and I lived here for many years . It is a living entity to me , so I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters of this film . And this is my planet - Earth . On the grand astrophysical scale , a place just as small and cozy as one's home town . Earth is also one of our characters . Ah , Home , Sweet Home . One does not choose one's homeland . Our Universe . The way we "" model heaven and calculate the stars "" on our computers . I have spent my whole life trying to understand what limits there are , and what lies beyond them . Striving to break through the Iron Curtain hung by God Himself . Why did you walk out on my film ? I have seen it many times before . Why did you walk out on your own film ? I have seen it too . You're trying to escape so you can keep getting drunk ? You promised to come help me at the studio . But you're shooting . I'm done for the day . Wait here , I'll tell Lynn to pack up alone . Sasha ? Sasha Greenberg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - Kostya Ruemin ! Remember ? It's a shame to forget your friends ! Let's get together ! My wife will make a good dinner . We'll have a good time . Excuse me . I am sorry . We haven't been introduced , but I know who you are . I need to discuss something with you . My name is Victor Krymsky . They're all are over him . I'm afraid he's going to drink himself into oblivion , and his speech is tomorrow . It's wonderful Sasha , how's tomorrow ? He said he 'd come to the studio with me . To help me negotiate to the Head of production . OK , if he's with you , he'll be fine . Okay , Sasha , let's go . Hello . My name is Victor Krymsky . I have a business proposal to discuss with Mister Greenberg . Sasha ! I heard you were here . I just dropped everything and here I am ! That's great ! That's great ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go . We'll miss the Head of production . I'm the president of cooperative "" Knowledge "" . Do you have a car ? I'll drive you . We would like to discuss the possibility of working with you . Excuse me , mister Greenberg is going to a very important meeting right now . Sasha , How's tomorrow ? I'm Lomova ! Asya Lomova ! Could I really have aged so much ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : This is my second day in Moscow . So far , I haven't managed to sleep a wink , or to have a single moment to myself . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Helen and I were met at the airport by my old friends Tolik and Natasha , and , also , Jill . Jill was already deep into her new environmental documentary project , so she came to Moscow earlier than last week in search of footage and co-producers . The whole gang is so excited ! Greenberg is coming ! He was the first we knew who emigrated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it is really happening . It seems as if all of Moscow has nothing else to talk about . Natasha was the prettiest girl in the entire physics department so , obviously , everybody gravitated towards her . Every holiday we would gather at her parents ' house . Each of us fell in love with her , more or less . Oh , It's rare for a woman to be studying physics . Especially one like you ... It was the same at Harvard . My parents are still alive , they remember you . They want to have a party Wednesday for the whole gang in honor of your visit . Like old times . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : When I left Moscow 17 years before this moment I had no inkling or even hope that I would come back here for a visit . Back then for the first time in decades , a door had been cracked open in the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain . Of all the soviet citizens some Jews were allowed to leave the country to supposedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were lucky and could leave , you 'd become "" an emigrant "" to those left behind . Officially this word sounded like "" An enemy of Russia "" . You would never be able to see your birthplace and your friends again . But recently , under "" Perestroika "" ( Restructuring ) my friends were permitted again to consider me their friend . ( @phone_rings ) Hello . It's for you . You've been traced , already . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The following day consisted of three dinners and four suppers . Everybody wanted to see the man returned from beyond . From where no one they knew had ever returned before . They wanted to see but strangely enough not to hear . They were no longer interested in the outside world . Too many things were happening in their own . They just elected the first president of Russia Boris Yeltsin and said good-bye to the father of "" Perestroika "" the president of disintegrated USSR Mikhail Gorbachev . Did you vote for Yeltsin ? Yes ... How could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator , he'll show you . You have a better alternative ? You fear there may be a civil war . Well , it's already here . Gorbachev was the greatest leader of our time ! Look at what he's done in Eastern Europe ! Gorbachev is the same as the rest , only weaker ! He couldn't revive the economy , he couldn't give freedom to the republics ! Gorbachev is a man of compromise , a politician without principle . He can not be trusted . I don't know why Americans are so fond of him ! Americans consider compromise a virtue . Anyway imagine if Gorbachev went ahead with his reforms without compromise , and we 'd have chaos . It seems to me we are on the verge of a collapse . Perestroika is dead ! Perestroika has just begun . Perestroika never had a chance . No one knows how to work anymore . Lazy , spoiled slaves , all of them ! Master . All day I waited for your call - it never came . Tried calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mohammed , Mohammed will come to the mountain . Give me a hug . Ahh . What's this ? ( @phone_rings ) Couldn't we just unplug it ? No , you're not in America . Telephones do not unplug here . That would create too much difficulty for those listening in . So , disciple ? Do you think you've won our argument ? Do you think the time has come for the rats to return from "" unexplored space "" ? They certainly think so and they get so exited . A human person has broken an "" iron curtain "" twice . Fourth and back ! This is an event . And , it is morning , and it is officially your birthday . Congratulations . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Gross was not your average Soviet physicist . He had come from America . He had participated in the creation of the nuclear bomb . America dropped this bomb on the Japanese . It was the age of McCarthyism Gross did not wish to serve the imperialist war mongers . In 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union . The "" free country "" at that time had twenty million of its citizens imprisoned in labor camps . Gross managed to avoid the labor camp only because the "" free country "" desperately needed those who knew how to build bombs . Of course , physicists did not defect from the Soviet Union . The borders of the "" free country "" were well guarded . After six months in the Soviet Union , Gross married his housekeeper - a virtually illiterate country woman . His colleagues were shocked by the marriage . But Gross lived with her for many years and always seemed perfectly satisfied with the union . Good coffee demands precise preparation . If , for example , you grind it electrically instead of manually , you will never achieve the proper aroma . Diogenes lived in a barrel . Why should one care where one lives ! I am convinced , however , that in his life there were certain elements of perfection . Perhaps he prepared an ideal coffee , or drank the best wine . To attain knowledge , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , however , periodically measure the quality of one's thought process against other paradigms of quality . Master , I've come to share a secret . I have applied for emigration . Psychologists at Harvard once conducted an experiment . They took some rats and placed them in a labyrinth with tunnels leading to various rooms . These rooms contained everything essential to rat happiness . There were rooms with food , rooms for sex . One of the tunnels led to a so-called "" unexplored space "" . The rats had no way of knowing what lay beyond this opening , since no rat ever returned from there . Still , fifteen percent of the rats would inevitably go into the "" unexplored space "" . They were terrified of it . They shook with fear . Their fur would stand on end , they would experience uncontrollable urine releases , they would howl - but , still , they would go . As it turns out both you and I belong to this fifteen percent . Except that in our case the Great Experimenter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side , calling the door connecting them "" unexplored space "" .. It so happens that the presence of rats from "" unexplored space "" does not change the magical number of fifteen percent and what we end up with is a perpetual exchange of urine-releasing bravadoes ... So , if they let you go , we will never see each other again ? Who can tell . Maybe you could visit me there . Or I could come here . I think not . Rats do not return from "" unexplored space "" . That's one of the givens of the experiment . Otherwise , how "" unexplored "" would it be ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Had it turned out that Gross was wrong ? Was I really now back in Moscow ? Was I really going in the car with my girl friend Jill to the State Film Studio to help her to negotiate with the Head of the Production , desperately desiring to get somewhere a sip of vodka , something that in Moscow I left 17 years ago was in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? What does all this madness about vodka mean ? Gorbachev started a war against Russian traditional alcoholism and now there is something which looks like limited prohibition . I have with me a famous American physicist . Good for Russians and bad for me . You should have called this morning , we could have got you a table . We can't do anything just now . We take reservations ten days in advance . I wish he 'd take us to the Studio already , and disappear . My friend ! The American doesn't wish to have a table at all . All he wants is a bottle of vodka . And he's willing to pay ten times your price . Well , that's normal . That's what everyone pays . It's funny . When I used to live here everybody couldn't manage without drinking but me . Now I am back and desperately need a drink , there's a vodka shortage . There you are . You can get anything in Moscow , it just takes know-how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint venture , we are guaranteed success . But I am not a businessman . We'll put together a group of Soviet scientists who'll generate scientific ideas for sale and develop ideas generated by American clients . We'll make lots of hard currency . Excuse me . Aren't we going to the studio ? The Head of production is expecting me there . He'll wait . His studio is not a private company like mine . It's a government agency - no one does any work there anyway . # They say our studio is not up to world's standards in terms of equipment . That is not so . Right now , for example , we're shooting ten films simultaneously . Take a look at this ! # I'm so pleased you've come to help your girl-friend , but , as you can see , it is not an interpreter she needs . I know enough English for that . It is a more delicate matter , She wants to do a co-production . Okay . Great . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary material . Fine . We'll get it for her , but not all of it . But something . But now she's asking to see our copyright to this material . What copyright ? I talked to every attorney in Moscow - no one knows whether we have this copyright or not . What's a copyright anyway ? Don't take it personal , but it's so difficult to work with Americans ! # Sex and Jews are our two most popular subjects today . Everyone wants to film what used to be forbidden . These Jewish looking actors never used to have any work - now they're all hot property . Everyone of them is under three or four contracts at once . They're the envy of all other actors . Unfortunately , I have to tell you that there is no mistake in our lists . You have not been accepted to the Physics/Math Department . But isn't there a law that says everyone graduating high school with a gold medal must be accepted without entrance examinations ? Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have enough courage to tell me the truth ! Sit down . You snotnose ! I am not the least bit afraid to tell you that you weren't accepted because you're a Jew . Because we have twice as many applicants like you - Jews with gold medals - than there are spots available at the University ! And even if I followed the law and turned this institution one hundred percent Jewish , there would still be no place for you , personally . I am prepared to take the examinations along with the other applicants . That I can not forbid you to do . May I answer right away , without preparation ? Are you sure you do not want to think over your answer first ? I got lucky . I pulled my favorite question . Well , what is that question ? The modern concept of the structure of the Universe . All right , then . Let's hear what you know about this . The modern concept of the structure of the Universe is based upon Einstein's general theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great October Revolution took place in our own country , another revolution also took place . Einstein claimed that all three of the space Dimensions were curved and that a spaceship travelling in the same direction for a long enough period of time would return to its point of origin . In 1922 , the Soviet mathematician Alexander Friedman offered another model . In his model , the Universe expands . Expansion began at a point . All of of today's models allow for an expanding Universe . Although I must add that not all scientists are pleased with this . I am not sure I like it either . The idea of the Universe appearing from nothing and perishing into collapse is somewhat unnerving to me . How is it possible ? Did the Universe begin at the point ? Did matter evolve from nothing ? What was there before the creation of the Universe ? Do you know , young man , that that particular question has already been answered ? Long before the birth of Albert Einstein . No , I didn't . By whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion , was there before the creation of the Universe ? In his opinion , before the creation of the Universe there was already a hell for those asking such questions . But you are a world-renowned physicist . So what ? There are no positions available at the University for head of project . Shiffman will not have me . He has already let too many Jews into his school , he's a Jew himself , he's afraid to let anyone else in . Logov has never let Jews in and is not about to start now and Sarkisian is far too poor . I will not be able to continue my research there . There really is no place for me to go . The only one who wants me is Burkov . So , where is the problem ? Go work for Burkov . He has plenty of money and you'll be able to continue your research . Burkov is making the bomb . And what of that ? Do you really believe that if you refuse to make it , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youth as well , the end result of which was that I helped build the bomb both here and over there . You can not stop progress , Sasha . There will always be someone willing to use scientific discovery to further causes of evil . What does that mean ? That science should be outlawed ? Do you think that if you don't work for Burkov now , some other Burkov in the future will not find a way to use your achievements for more efficient warfare ? Or something even worse ? If that's the case , why not just quit altogether ? I am only interested in the structure of the Universe . Why can't I be left alone to study it ? Be left alone - in Burkov's employ . Even Christ , that shining beacon of morality , preached to "" render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's "" . Continue your cosmological research for God , and make the bomb - for Caesar . ( @voice_over ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wandered the streets , saying goodbye to my beloved city . That summer in Moscow was hit with an unprecedented heat wave . The sidewalks practically melted under one's feet . The streets in Moscow were swirled in acrid smog . All around the city underground swamps were on fire . The "" refusniks "" would jokingly remark that the Egyptian plagues had begun . Applying for emigration was risky . One might never get permission to leave and be forced to remain in Russia an outlaw - "" a refusnik "" with your career and life ruined . Still I wasn't afraid . Somehow I was sure of my luck . Our committee reviewed your application to change your permanent place of residence to the country of Israel and decided that permission should not be granted . On what grounds ? On the grounds that you were involved in classified work . But the Institute where I worked was not classified . You can not know that . Our committee only can know which organizations are classified and which aren't . I suggest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in not less than three years . What will happen if I find work and in three years you again decide that it is classified ? Then you will again be refused . # The woman who works for me has all the footage you are looking for . She shot it herself , so there won't be any problem with the copyright . Let's go right now to the editing room in my church . In 15 minutes we are expected to be at the Congress banquet . Then you'll come to my place tomorrow first thing in the morning . Agree ? Ladies and gentlemen ! We have a very special guest with us today ! For those of you who don't know , he like many others , had to leave us during the years of stagnation . And he is the first of immigrants we knew , who has come back to visit us . It is Sasha Greenberg ! This is especially difficult for me , as you all know Greenberg is my pupil . But treason is treason . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts . I confess I should have exercised more foresight , I should have recognized Greenberg as a future traitor right away . I am guilty . I only hope never to repeat this mistake . We are proud of Sasha's success in America , his achievements are ours , for he is flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood . All the more joyous this day , when we can again be together . Sasha , come over to my house ! You can't refuse , I've already got a lamb ! Does anyone else want to say anything ? Comrades , comrades , what is happening here ? Greenberg wants to emigrate to Israel and professor Gross can find nothing better than to accuse him of treason ? ! Of course , we all know that Greenberg is a traitor . Our nation fed him , nourished Greenberg , spent money for his education , and now he wants to emigrate to Israel , to give his knowledge to our imperialistic enemies , to the enemies of the all progressive humankind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow this ! Greenberg's place is not Israel , it's prison ! What do you think about that ? You , Tolik Gurov ! You used to be his friend ! Come up here ! Tell us what you think ! This is true . Sasha was my friend ... I am sorry ... Who could have known ? Who could have guessed ? I will try to not have friends again ... I mean , such friends . This is better , with the water . In case it's bugged . You're not mad at me , are you ? He just left me no choice . It doesn't matter what I say . You're leaving anyway . I'm the one who has to stay here ... Maybe I should leave too ? What do you think ? Just because Galileo publicly denied his beliefs , the Earth did not stop orbiting the Sun . It is all , like Hamlet said , words , words , words . Thanks . For what ? For being the only one to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright . It's just a ritual , anyway . No one really thinks like that . Yeah . Right . Want to come over ? I have some vodka ... OK ? Let's go . No shame ! No shame at all ! Now they're bringing men to the rooms ... Oh , wait till I call the police . Don't pay any attention . She's totally harmless . You know , I was in love with you our freshmen year . I suspected it . Why didn't you say something ? Everybody was in love with you . Swarms of Casanovas ... I was too shy . Shall we drink to your departure , yeah ? It's a little strange - everybody wanted to be with you and you're still not married . Yeah , I'm too picky . Why aren't you married ? I guess I'm too picky also . To the picky one's . You may stay here , if you want . It's hard to believe you're leaving us . We'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It's a strange word ... Never . It's not definite yet . I'm the first PhD physicist to apply for emigration . They may not let me out . Oh , you will leave . And a good thing too . You'll be happy there ... Just don't try being noble right now and asking me to marry you so we could leave together . My life's already planned out . I'll never make a good wife , I'm afraid . I can't serve astrophysics and a man too at the same time . I would like to have a baby , though ... and I think sometimes : what if I pick one of you guys , one of the best , and get pregnant . I would hide it from the father , of course . It's easier to care for a child without having to care for a man too , huh ? So , there is theory in your solitude . Well , then , in mine too . I have thought of leaving many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve thought of defecting even . What would I do with a wife ? It's just pure luck for me that emigration started when it did ... What ? Oh , are you afraid I'm going to try and get pregnant right now ? Don't worry . Not tonight . Do you like her ? She is my daughter . You see , I did it . I had a child and I raised her without a husband . I had this certain plan . Sasha knew about it . Doesn't her father know he has a daughter ? I didn't tell him . And her ? I didn't tell her either . Once , when she got especially persistent , I told her she couldn't meet him anyway . She wanted to know why . I said , "" because he is an American "" . She got stuck on the idea , she tells everyone her father is an American , she speaks to everybody in English ... So it goes . Is he actually American ? In a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Elena . Elena , as you know , Sasha is my old friend . Mom has told me lots about you . And not just Mom . You're sort of a legend around here . To my surprise , I am discovering this for myself . As well as some other things . Why did you name her Elena ? Why not ? I see you've met my namesake . We've become quite good friends in the past few days . I don't have any friends ! I'm sorry . Don't take it personally . I really don't have any friends . Why don't you have friends , Elena ? Do you ? As a matter of fact , yes . That's just because you're American . Around here , we don't do that . What nonsense you're saying ! Don't you know how many friends I have ? I know . That's why I said it . She's so difficult lately . Adolescence , you know . Comrades ! Comrades ! Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend we are greeting today after years of separation ! There is another person , well known to most of you here , whom we haven't seen in just as many years as Sasha . Friends , let us drink to the ever beautiful Helen of Troy ! # Excuse me , are you ... Helen Preston ? Yes , yes I am . You called ... Asked me to come ... Here I am . I am Sasha Greenberg . Of course ! Of course ! You're the famous Greenberg ! Famous ? How ? The first physicist refusenik . The freedom fighter . So , you came over from America on an exchange program ? Citizen , you are violating laws here . Let's see your pass ! You've been fired from this institute . You should've turned in your pass a long time ago . I'll be leaving in a few minutes . What few minutes ? Chromov , Come on , take his other arm ! Sasha ! This is a serious offense . This is a scientific facility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comrade called and informed us . Otherwise , we 'd be taking the heat for this . Is that the spy ? Let's have him ! Sasha , I will be behind you . You're Greenberg ? I am . You can go . Why was I detained ? Why don't you ask your buddies at the institute . Suddenly , there's this racket - spy , spy , spy ! The director of the institute says "" he's no spy "" . So go on , get out of here before someone else gives an opinion ! Oh , thank God , it's you ! I called the embassy , I called Gross . I guess Gross he must have got through to them . Thanks . Did you know this could happen if you showed up ? I didn't entirely discount the possibility . So why did you come ? You asked me to . Until the end of last century , Moscow was a completely unique city . All green and white , yellow and gold . Hills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with green roofs drowning in the gardens , golden domes crowning churches and cathedrals .. So , you were saying that your experiments support my hypothesis ? Now , if gamma is less than one you must increase the mass by a factor of two . Right . But gamma is more than one in this case . Can we see your house from here ? My house ? Ah , it's over there . You see the yellow high-rises right behind there . Let's go there ? God , I've never felt so happy . Happy Birthday ! You gon na let me in ? Of course ... Come in , I didn't invite anyone . Didn't plan anything . Thanks for remembering . You're not supposed to invite anyone . A birthday party should only be for those who remember . You think anyone remembers me now ? We'll see about that . ( doorbell ) You see ! And you said no one would remember ! Oh , Sasha ! Happy birthday ! ( singing ) Sasha , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in private . Right now ? OK , go ahead . I want to make a toast ! Where's Natasha ? Where's Helen of Troy ? I'll get them . I want to tell you I'm in love with Sasha . I want everything to be in the open between us . Wonderful ! Why tell me , of all people ? Because I thought you were together . Sasha and I are old friends . If you mean sex , then , yes , we did sleep together ... once . You have my permission . Even if I were in love with him , maybe even he with me , I would still tell you to go ahead . Why ? Because Sasha's destiny is not with me . There is nothing I can do to help him , but you can . What about you ? Don't you wan na leave ? No , It's very hard for a woman to attain any sort of position in science . I've achieved a lot here and Gross appreciates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Where the hell did everybody go ? I want to make a toast already . ( singing ) Your application is accepted . The trial period is three months . Come back in three months and we will marry you . Three months ! What do you mean , in three months ? Her visa expires in two weeks ! Couldn't you speed it up , in view of the circumstances ? Young man , we do not make exceptions or "" speed things up "" ! The law is the same for everybody ! I know their tricks . You won't be able to get a visa for longer than a month and we'll never be able to get married . Fine ! I'll contact the Senate . I'm going to get you out of here ! The American Senate ? What does it have to do with anything ? Everything . Sasha , this is Rabbi Katz , this is Sasha . Shalom . Shalom . The rabbi has kindly agreed to marry us . But you're not even Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not recognize a marriage performed by an American rabbi . But the American Senate will , and I think the American people will . And then we'll see what your authorities will have to say . ( MUSIC ) It was my mother's ... Who knows what's hidden inside this little figurine . Who is this ? That was my father . He was killed in 1945 . That's his last picture . Pictures of military uniforms are forbidden to leave the country . But it's from World War Two ! I don't make up the laws . You can leave it behind or I can cut it . Go ahead . Cut . Do you think you've outwitted the experimenters and returned from unexplored space ? I wasn't thinking that at all , Master . On the contrary , you were right all along : one does not return from unexplored space . I have merely made another pass into a new unexplored space . How long's it been since you've been here ? Seventeen years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I can't . They're gon na tell you how great everything has become , how things have changed . Don't believe them . Our lives are still pretty hard . You're a guest ? Go right ahead , I'm not even going to open it . Go on , your friends are waiting . Your labyrinth has changed so much , I can't keep a sense of reality . I have a persistent feeling I'm in a dream . Reality can get a little hazy when one consumes such vast amounts of alcohol . That's why I drink , partially , to regain a sense of reality . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Reality ! Obviously this word still had some clear meaning for Gross . As for me , all such words as reality , logic , sanity , time , place lost their sense a long time ago . It's amazing . Can I really live here ? Can you really be my wife ? I'm really your wife , and I have some news for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him ? Thank God . Where was he ? What happened ? Brenda lost the baby ! She found him . Yeah . Thank you . Thank you . I'm coming . I'm going to have to quit my job . If that's what you really want . I don't think I have a choice . I , I used to get so angry whenever people said women they only go to college to get husbands , but , maybe , they were right . Daddy has to stay home and work today and tomorrow too ... OK ? We'll play later . I have to work on the phone . Anything ? No , it's useless . There are no open positions anywhere . How about universities ? They are always looking for someone . Not all universities have the means and facilities I need to continue working on my model . So , now what ? I don't know . Hughes wants to hire me . He keeps calling back . He's got tons of money . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I had somewhere to emigrate then . Oh well , if it's a chance for you to keep working on your model , how can I say "" no "" ? By the way , he is paying triple of what I get now . I'm , I'm so tired . So much work in the house . God , if you only knew how much I hate you ! I hate your face , I hate your voice , I hate the air you breathe ! But most of all I hate that Universe of yours that consumes absolutely everything . It sucked away every single drop of my life ! I've had it . You go sacrifice somebody else's life for it . Just go ! Worship it . Go , go ! Fuck it for all I care ! Have fun ! I love you . You know that . Me ? ! You love me ? ! The only thing you worship is your Universe and your own mind . ( @phone_ringing ) Yes ? Yes , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . You're making a film about science . Your wife ? Umm ... maybe not . What does that mean ? It means that I am not sure . I am afraid I can't give you definite answers on everything , not even science . So , be forewarned . Scientific progress is a pretty ambiguous concept . After Hiroshima , it is very fashionable to give up science . It may have been a sixties ' cliche . But you didn't give up ? I know that and smoking and drinking are bad for me , but I haven't given them up . Besides , I've already mentioned an ambiguity , an uncertainty . Science has done a lot of good too . So , if I understand you correctly , that a science is much like the presence of your wife : a definite "" maybe "" . Agree ? Agree . What're you . Would you like to have dinner with me ? Maybe ... There is a certain ambiguity involved here , an uncertainty . And you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Universe is boundless . Imagine that on a small planet orbiting a tertiary star , one of billions of such stars in an insignificant galaxy , a group of microscopic creatures dares to grasp in their minds the entire extent of the Universe ! Let us drink to ourselves , friends , the most daring representatives of the daring race of humankind ! What's there to be proud of ? Man's a dirty animal ! The only species with the bent and ability to self-destruct , taking the rest of the planet with it ! I know , I know . Our atmosphere is polluted . Our waters are poisoned . Entire species of animals are being annihilated ! We are living on a bomb with the lit fuse , and still we dare to be proud of ourselves ! And all human family values and social traditions have collapsed . For real , do you have a wife or not ? In the past two years , she's left four times and come back three times . And why ? Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her to ... and , I guess , she does love me . Why 'd she leave ? She says I ruined her career . She was a scientist before I ... before she had the baby and quit work to stay home . You're a male chauvinist ? ! Bullshit ! I hate those labels ! For the past two years she's been working anyway . And before that she's always done what she's wanted . I've yet to see a married woman who does whatever she wants ! You two should get along splendidly . My God ! You're so beautiful ! Are you Helen ? Nice to meet you . I'm Jill . In eighteen years , he's never once said thank you for anything I've done ! What're you talking about ? Did you thank me every time I came home with a paycheck ? It's ridiculous . No , it's not . You earned your paycheck doing what you loved best ! What did I get for my work ? ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'re such a Male chauvinist ! I never asked for your sacrifices . You wanted me to give up my career ! To compromise all my principles and live on blood money you got for making bombs ! Nobody , absolutely nobody forced you into any of it ! Besides , if you want to talk about sacrifices , you should try eating one of your dinners ! I'm an astrophysicist Sasha . I'm not your cook ! So be an astrophysicist ! Nobody's stopping you . Professor , you know how much respect I have for you , but there is something I wish to steal . It is Sasha ? The very one . Will you permit me ? What can I do ? I can refuse you nothing . Thank you , professor . It's so stuffy in here . Let's go outside for a few minutes . Come on , let's go . We'll be back in a minute . It's right around here . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Moscow . The familiar city of my youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve been driving for half an hour . A whole half hour without alcohol . It might actually be good for your health . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : I hoped to find here the answers to the questions I am struggling with , instead I've got more questions . Will I manage to find answers to them ? And this is where we live these days . When my daughter was born , I applied for a new place . It took three years . You remember my old communal apartment - what a rough time I had with Elena there . Now we have two rooms . It's pretty far , but it's alright . The Metro is fast . Is Elena coming right back ? Uh uh . She is spending the night at her grandparents ' . There's your vodka . Is she my daughter ? What difference does it make ? What do you mean , what difference ? I want to know . Don't bother asking , I'm not going to tell you anyway . Let's drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait ... Don't say a word , Sasha . I am not blind , I have seen your harem of women . Look at me . Look at me . My body is just as good as twenty years ago . Aren't you happy I brought you here ? Tomorrow we'll dance the tango at my parents ' . You won't believe this . All the old records are still there . Nothing has changed at their house . Do you remember the old church next door ? The one that used to be all nailed up ? We used to sneak in at night ? It's being restored . It looks like new . We'll go there , I'll show you around . Mom ! It's me . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : This girl . She did not even exist when I left . Everyone hardly changed at all , but out of nowhere , as if out of sea foam - there she was . There was something mystical about that . Don't come in here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did you come back then ? It's my house too . It is . Now go to sleep , darling . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : All my days in Moscow I couldn't stop thinking about Elena and , look , here she was . Now she will move furniture all night long . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The presence of this girl was definitely changing my perception of the world . Do you know how it is in science fiction , when you return from a trip to the past to find out you accidentally changed something ? Both your past and your present are no longer yours . They may seem the same at first glance , but you look closer and no - there is this girl . So , you inevitably start re-examining everything else , including yourself . We can not be the same , life can not go on as before . Good morning . Good morning . Although I am not sure it is morning yet . I've wanted to talk to you . Let's walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there to do around here at this time ? Oh , sure . In America , you can probably go to a cafe at three in the morning , at 5 in the morning , at 7 o'clock . Yes . I hate it ! I hate all of this . Because there aren't any cafes ? Because there isn't any life . Don't make jokes , sir . Do you think you're my father ? I don't really know . What do you think ? I don't know . But I don't think so . According to my papers , I am sixteen . Which means that you left at least six months before she got pregnant . Of course , she could've forged them . Who ? My mother . She can do anything . You're so harsh . I hate her . She is an old lying bitch . Well , obviously our perspectives are a little different . Want to know what I think of your mother ? Yeah . She's a lovely , talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to have a career in science , but to raise you as well . That's a miracle in itself . Through all this she's retained a youthful sense of romanticism . You call her a liar , but I 'd rather think of her as romantic . Because she lies ? Yeah ? We were talking about tomorrow . You know what she wants to do ? She was dreaming of showing me an old church . I'm sure . She takes all her men to that stupid church . She's been there a thousand times . You are cruel . You're cruel ! Don't you see ? If you loved her even a little bit , you wouldn't make her sound like such a saint . I don't think I understand . And what do you do understand ? I want to tell you about myself . I grew up under the portrait of a man I never met . He was a hero , they said . A man who wasn't afraid to apply for emigration when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to conquer the Universe . A genius . The new Einstein . Kiss me . Not like that . For real . Elena . You're supposed to know how to take a risk . This is my cab . Yours is the next one . See you tomorrow . Hi . Morning . Were you waiting for me ? Yeah . You want to get some sleep ? It's already morning . Why bother ? What do you want most of all right now ? Seriously ? Absolutely . An interesting question . There's no rush . Think about it . I 'd really like to see the house where I grew up . Something has definitely changed here . I can't believe this . We're finally alone . To think that , in this yard , I spent several thousand of my childhood days . I recognize it , but , at the same time , I don't . I have this strange feeling I'm going to wake up in New York any minute now . You know , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . Maybe I am sleeping ? Or losing my mind . The window has been bricked up . The building was remodeled five years ago . They were going to tear it down , but changed their minds . Stop , kike ! Stop . kike ! Stop kike ! Kike-take a hike ! We've got you now ! Ugh ! I smell garlic ! Ugh ! The kike stinks of garlic ! You're Sasha Greenberg , aren't you ? Yes , I am . I'm Volodya Listov . We've got you now , you dirty kike ! On your knees , kike ! Down , I said ! Do you recognize me ? We haven't seen each other in , what , since we were twelve or so , when you moved away . I recognized you , though . We used to be friends when we were kids . When we were little , we used to fight , of course , but kids are supposed to . Repeat after me : "" I am a dirty kike ... "" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stink . "" I am gross . "" I am gross . "" I am begging you to beat the shit out of me . "" I am begging you to beat me . Then we used to share a desk at school . I , a young pioneer of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , here , before my comrades , do solemnly swear to always uphold the ideals of Lenin and Stalin and to fight for Victory of Communism everywhere . To fight for the ideals of Lenin and Stalin . Be prepared ! Always prepared ! You're lucky you ran into me . I am the only one left of the old tenants . Everyone's been moved out to the new developments . The building's not the same , either . All the walls have been moved around . I can't even show you your old apartment - it doesn't exist anymore . I am the only one who could get a place here after they renovated . And that , um , only because it was mainly my efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to save buildings . Don't you know ? I'm a writer . Pretty famous too , in a way . Where do you live , What do you do ? I live in America . I'm in cosmology - that's a science about how the Universe works . Interesting stuff ! Do you want to come in for a while ? We can talk , have a drink over old times . I really don't think so . We're on a very tight schedule . We have to meet someone in a half hour . Krymsky . At his church . Then Sasha has to give his report . Krymsky , the millionaire ? I know him a little . If you don't mind , I 'd like to join you . Morning . Hello . Hello . Good morning . ( BANDPLAYING ) Ah , my worst enemy ! Good of you to join us ! What brings you here ? I've long been curious to see what you do here . You have an objection ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your magazine is just free publicity for us . ( BANDPLAYING ) You see , he calls me his worst enemy ! And he's not far from the truth . Why , of course , I am . Look ! He's turned God's house into a honky-tonk , for Christ's sake ! You people want me to be happy about it ? Would you prefer if it were still a warehouse for boots ? I didn't turn it into a warehouse . I would prefer it to still be a house of God . Him and his lot , you wait , they'll be calling me a reactionary and an anti-Semite . Well , if you want , I am a reactionary . Now they're poisoning our youth with this rock'n'roll crap . By "" they "" you mean Jews , of course ? You see , what did I tell you ? You know , there are Jews and there are Jews . ( BANDPLAYING ) I have friends who are Jews . A profiteer like him , who's Russian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jew profiteer . Anyway , nobody can deny that there's a disproportionately large amount of Jews in this new "" private sector "" . Just as there was in the revolution . And just who do you think made warehouses out of churches ? Jews are so overly sensitive to criticism . At Nuremberg they tried such critics ! Understand ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Yes , no doubt Russia of 1992 was drastically different from Russia prior to Perestroika . In the churches boot warehouses were replaced with freedom-loving rock singers , and Krimsky was running business activities which in the Russia I left were punishable by years of imprisonment or even execution by firing squads . So , what does your company really do ? Are you a scientific research facility , a film studio , or a rock theatre ? It's like a daisy flower - in the center is the main enterprise from which sprout separate ventures and petals . Our major petal I'll be showing you tomorrow . Site seeing tours of Moscow on "" troikas "" with gypsies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They're carriages drawn by three horses together . Very Russian . Very Russian . They're waiting for us in the editing room , ready to start , I believe . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And now we were going to see footage , that not long ago was banned from any screening at all . So why didn't all these changes in Russia thrill me ? This is just raw footage . I understand you're gathering footage like that from all over the world . I'll comment as we go along . Every year Soviet factories release over sixty million tons of pollutants . In sixty-eight different industrial centers , the air pollution level exceeds the norm by 100 times . Twenty percent of Soviet citizens live in ecologically critical areas and another thirty five to forty percent in areas "" ecologically unsafe "" . This is about 175 million people - approximately eight times the population of Canada . The Black sea is overloaded with pollutants . Every year they dump 30 tons of mercury in there , not to mention about dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half million dolphins that used to live here not long ago , are now survived by only eighty thousand . The great Russian Volga river , it contains approximately 700 times the allowed con-centration of oil-industry wastes . Most of Soviet rivers are in much worse condition . A farmer passing by threw his cigarette butt in this river . Is anyone tired ? Should I stop ? These things aren't only happening in Russia . I 'd like to show you some of my footage . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : "" The time is out of joint "" - Shakespeare said it half a millennium ago and we are happily repeating it century after century and keep switching it out of joint endlessly . How long can it go on ? The planet life was healthier in the time of Shakespeare . And family life is definitely deteriorated since then . I hate you . I hate your face , I hate your voice , I hate the air you breathe . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : At least if I judge by mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen . It's crazy ! You told me you've never had sex like this before ! With anybody ! And I'll say it again . You said you couldn't live with Helen . I did . And she left you ? She did . Then marry me ... I'll stop making films if you want . I can be a really good wife . I'll make breakfast for you every morning . Want me to ? No . Why ? Because this is like a deja-vu ! Because I've been through this with Helen ! And the recurrence of this pattern scares the hell out of me . Helen and I have been through enough insanity . I don't want that for you . But I won't be like that . If you marry me you will . I know . Why ? Because the world's gone crazy ! Because the traditional family has crumbled and there's nothing left to replace it ! Everyone - women , nations , Soviet physicists - everyone wants freedom but , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my paper , I would like to say a few words . The world is changing at an incredible pace . When I was younger , scientists were the undisputed heroes of my time . The 19th century philosophy still prevailed , war , famine , and disease would all magically disappear if we could only educate people properly . The Biblical parable of Adam and Eve's banishment from the garden of Eden after eating forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge was reduced to a silly fairy tale . The very thought that knowledge could bring anything except absolute bliss was laughable . The curiosity that is the essential characteristic of every scientist was regarded as a moral virtue . It was referred to as "" sacred curiosity "" . My own professor , Doctor Heinrich Gross , would do everything in his power to instill this quality into his students . I do the same thing now , with my new students ! It is the only moral basis of humanity , the only thing that separates us from the animals , this sacred curiosity ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps that is why animals haven't tried to annihilate the human race , and humans , are even now , successfully ridding the planet of all animal life . My friends , tell me honestly , have you ever thought that man is the plague of the Universe ? God's punishment , an implement of death and destruction , something akin to a virus or a cancerous growth that exists only to destroy all life ? Demagogy ! Do not fear , Master , I am not calling for the banishment of science . I felt I had to say these words . Thank you for indulging me . ( CLAPPING ) Ah , let's now get down to business . How close is your model to a final understanding of the Universe ? I feel it's very close . Excuse me , I think I missed something : does your theory offer an immediate solution for any of today's problems ? I need a drink . You need some sleep . Do you really think I could sleep ? I need a drink first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably won't get it until tomorrow . Was I really that bad ? Everyone seemed to like it . I feel horrible . Get some sleep , Sasha . If I don't have a drink I'm going to throw up . I heard your parents are giving a party for Sasha this evening . Um um . Yes , they are . Are you expecting a lot of people ? A dozen or so ... We're going to have a trial run of our Moscow tours on troikas with gypsies right now , and I would like to invite your group . Sasha and Jill are coming . Thank you . I 'd also like to ask if you would invite us to your little gathering this evening . Eh . Thanks . Yeah . It was awful . Just awful . Sasha , you're a hero here and you want to be one . I guess you had to think of something to impress the little girl ! Now , why did you say that ? Supposedly , you brought me up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not make it worse ? Cut it out ! I am not your mother ! I'm not even your wife . Leave , then . Fine ! ( @knock_on_door ) Come in ! What happened to you ? The gypsies are waiting ! ( SINGING ) Stop here for one second . I see they just got a vodka delivery . What , are all these grandmothers alcoholics or something ? They get forty rubles a month pension . If you remember , we paid thirty for a bottle of vodka the other day . Tonight , each of them will sell a bottle and raise their standard of living almost twice . It's called survival . Forty rubles ! That's enough for one dinner at a restaurant ! With no drinks . But why would grandmothers go to restaurants anyway ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Aye , brave beautiful new world ! We are worrying about having too much freedom and the old ladies are fighting to survive on the monthly pension that can't buy one diner in a restaurant ! Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A month ago , they permitted selling at the Rizhsky Market , and now they're forbidding it again ! What are people supposed to do with all the goods they manufactured to sell there ? How's anyone going to make any money this way ? That's a weak government for you . Those helpless liberals don't know whether they're coming or going . If it were up to me , I 'd shut that Rizhsky Market down once and for all . It's a joke ! A fur hat costs three times my pension ! Who's going to buy it ? Only another speculator , like themselves ! So ! In a government store you 'd never even see a hat ! So , who needs hats anyway ! First it was the party bigwigs who went around in fur hats , now it's the speculators . It's never the plain folk . I don't care if I'm being exploited by Brezhnev or a speculator - it's all the same ! We need justice , equality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of Russia ! Wait a minute ! If you don't let anyone make the hats , you'll all be going around bareheaded ! Better without hats than without justice ! Where did you get that ? We'll spare no expense when it comes to our own flesh and blood ! You bought it at a private market . You can't get piglets at a government store . So let them grow pigs ! But not at these prices ! What prices ? ! They start from nothing ! If they don't survive , you'll never see any piglets at all ! During Stalin you could get piglets in the stores ! During Stalin twenty million were slaving away in labor camps ! And if you were ten minutes late for work they 'd put you away too ! At least there was order . You see ! I rest my case ! Chaos ! Disaster ! We're headed for civil war ! I must say , I don't envy Gorbachev . Trying to get this country to budge . You've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . What's that supposed to mean ? We're going to set things straight . And who died and left you boss ? We don't need your blessing . As soon as these liberals bring the country to complete collapse , it will fall into our hands , like a ripe fruit . May I have this dance ? I can't dance to this . Oh , it's simple . Come , come , I'll show you . Come . What is the reason for all this gloom ? It's all so boring . All these stupid arguments and now this ridiculous tango . You can leave if you're bored . No one's keeping you from being with kids your own age . Kids my own age ! What a joke ! Professor , you're a wise man . Tell me , why is it all so awful ? Why is everybody so mean ? Whenever I tell someone I want to go to America , they tell "" it's no better over there "" ! Like they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s play , the three sisters want to get away from the boonies , they keep saying "" we want to go to Moscow "" , and in the whole play there's no villain mean enough to tell them "" it sucks there too "" . Happiness is not found in Moscow or New York . It's here . You just need time to find it . Have you ? I have . Want to go see the old church ? What's the matter ? My mother's interest in architecture is amazing ! She has just invited Greenberg to see an old church ! A church ! What church ? Where is it ? That's right ! There's a famous old church near here . Let's all go see it together ! SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Many years past since this glorious morning in Moscow , but I still remember it as it happened only yesterday . You seem troubled , my man . What have you to be troubled about ? Master , life has somehow lost much of its luster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much similar to adolescence . It's a troubled time . Difficult . But It will pass . You'll get over it . Everyone does . I feel like my mid-life crisis is also happening to Russia , to America , to the whole human race . And if you believe the theory that man is a reflection of the Universe , than , it's also happening to the Universe . I don't understand this world , this life . There's a story , of a woman who asked Thomas Alva Edison to explain electricity because she did not understand it . He answered , that he didn't understand it either and told her to "" Just use it ! "" Here it is called "" perestroika "" - the restructuring . Although some people seem to think it's a complete collapse , an end . If you look at the film Jill is making you 'd think the whole planet was doomed for sure . You tell me it's only a phase , that I'm going through a "" restructuring "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ending . Adolescents feel that way . Some of them even go so far as to actually commit suicide . But there are few of those . Most restructure and survive . Look at Elena . How she suffers ! That's also a "" perestroika "" , of sorts . And it's not so bad . It's , in fact , what makes her so attractive . To you , for example . Master , I am old enough to be her father ! So what ? Why do you tell me all this ? To ease your conscience about your attraction to Elena . It's not so easy ! It's quite possible , you know , that she is my daughter . No , she is not . What makes you so sure ? Because she is my daughter . My loss , your luck . Enjoying the architecture ? There is something interesting I can show you , even my mother doesn't know about it . Interested ? Let's go . I come up here a lot . At dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Professor Gross told me that happiness must be found within oneself . Do you agree ? I guess . Did you find it ? I'm afraid not . Why not ? I don't know . Maybe it's my fault . Sometimes it's like some outer force prevents it : how can I be happy when the world's gone mad and everything around me is collapsing . Is it the people ? Why they don't want to understand ? Why they don't want to hear ? Yes . They don't hear . Not you , not each other . Not themselves . Nobody listens . But we can make them hear ! Come on ! Help me ! You said you heard me !

Juliet's a little bony for me . She was doing this thing when she was riding me ... with her hips , I don't know , but it fuckin ' hurt . Other than that she was pretty okay . If she gives me the clap ... I'll fuckin ' kill her . So ... what about you and Darcy ? What's the real scoop ? Once ... I really had this thing with the stars . I wanted to be an astronomer . from the Horses's Head Nebula . So I took this pup out for a walk -- This pup I was looking after ... You were looking after Darcy's puppy ? Yeah . We were friends then . Anyways , I couldn't see it that well because of the town's glare , so I took the pup out along - - along the backtrails towards where the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wasn't . Then I seen the meteors flashing as they hit the atmosphere . There was ever lots . Hundreds . I started hollering , I got so happy and excited that I put that puppy down too close to the huskies . By the time I saw ... that puppy was already chewed up . I mean ... they fuckin ' tore her up . Oh , shit . Last June , I saw him walking down the highway , ' cause his ride left him ' cause he was being an asshole . So , I go up , I say hi -- He just fuckin ' smokes me and I go down . And I lay there and I'm thinking , "" Guess we're even . "" But he just kept on fucking kicking me and kicking me , about his puppy and how I fucked everything up . I told my mom I just got rolled by a drunk . You know , you shoulda been even . Hey , bud . ... Hey . Kinda late , don't ya think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whoa , hey , hey , hey , buddy -- Jed ! Leave it ! somehow you step away from me . I can't get in . You won't let me in . Like I'm doing something wrong -- I'm doing the best that I can -- Well , why am I even here ? I came back for you . I came for Larry ! I didn't ask you to come - - ? Larry ! ? Come here , Larry ! Larry : No , dad ! ? ? ? Mr . Harrister : So as you see , the positioning of the organs within the body is very precise . It's like a blueprint for the body . One of the most amazing things about the organs , is that they operate without us even thinking about it - - ( laughing ) Focus ! And so now we've covered all of the organs . So , as a reminder the organs are the structure of the body , comprised of at least two tissues working together for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pray tell , organ am I pointing at ? Mr . Harrister -- That would be the organ that you're missing . ( studentslaughing ) Juliet : You know , there was this guy once , his name was Larry . in that mind of his but he kept it to himself . He played guitar . And one day this angel came down to see him of yours is great , we're really happy you found it , but could you like , spread it around a bit like the other musicians ? Come on ... And Larry just looked at them and said , "" those other musicians "" are looking for the right note . "" I already found mine . "" ? ? ? So , look at the chap , he's sprouting some fuzz , hm ? ( laughing ) Take it easy , eh ? So ... What happened in the Barrenlands ? Larry -- You said that you thought something happened . Jeez -- Where do I begin ? So I guess this , uh ... I guess this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her he was going out on the land to bring her some caribou or muskox . But he never came back . That woman , she went crazy waiting for her old man . Her six kids were starving . I guess she got tired of always hearing them ask , "" when's daddy coming home ? "" You know ... So one day she , uh ... she lost it . She took her kids to the edge of the lake . She pulled them into the water and she drowned ' em . The , uh ... So , you want to know what happened , right ? They found her husband . They found his body while I was up on Ranger patrol up in the tundra . He was dead . He really did go hunting for a caribou or muskox . But he died . I guess he was out hunting and he got charged . Killed by a muskox . Got him in the back with his horns , it pierced his heart and his lungs from behind . Hit him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . They were stuck together . That man must have bled to death . Muskox couldn't eat -- They died together . That woman killed her kids for nothing . ( @water_dripping ) ? ? Ahhhhh ! ? ? ( coughing ) Here , dude -- Listen , Lare -- I got ta teach you some moves . Yeah ? You better . Next time someone like Darcy gets to you , just remember it's three hits . You hittin ' them , ( laughing ) I'm serious - - and then ... the ambulance hits ninety -- All right - - Okay -- Come at me - - Gim me your hand -- With your hand on my chest -- Ugh ! Lare , come on - - You're supposed to block it . Wan na know what is embarassing ? That muskrat mouth . Time for a shave there -- Juliet will be here in a bit . Maybe she'll bring a friend . Go to the bathroom and shave that fuzz off your lip . Sometimes your shirt slips down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well what ? Larry , man , what the hell happened to you ? I was born this way . Lemme see that neck -- Those are fucking burn marks , Larry . I had an accident . Yeah , I guess you had an accident . When was this ? Why is Darcy teasing you with fire ? Well ? What the fuck happened to you , man ? ! I got kissed by the devil , man . They're fucking hickeys ! ? ? ? Hey , Donny , what are you doing ? What does it look like , chief ? ? ? What's up , Dog-lick ? Were you pushin ' or pulling ' in there ? ? I said were you pushing or pulling in there ? WHACK ! Lare ! WHACK-WHACK WHACK ! WHACK ! Holy shit , Larry . If you were Mexican , you 'd be Rocky . Yeah , man -- You didn't have to do that though . You totally busted his nose . You owe me for wiping up the blood , by the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids and gum in your hair . What's your point ? My point , dick-smack , is you got purple eyelids and gum in your hair . Shit . Classy . Real classy . You really did it , buddy . Now , you're in . And now you really got to learn the rules of fighting . Next time you're at a party and someone wants to fight , they might grab you . Well -- You are fair game now . If you get into a fight and you get hurt bad - - just stay down . You stay down and you cover your head . And the person you're fighting's gon na take that as a surrender . It works 99% of the time . If they're drunk , you run your Indian ass the hell out of there . ' Cause drunks like to keep kicking . I know . Larry ? Jed took off again , didn't he ? He was called up north . What calls him up north ? Why won't you marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuckin ' freak -- Psycho fuckin ' Larry ! Guys - - Guys , what's happening ? Darcy told everyone what happened before you came to Simmer . He said that you burned your dad . ? Is this true , Larry ? ? ? ? ( @phone_ringing ) No , he didn't come back home . I tried everywhere , no one's seen him , no one's saying anything . ? ? ? WHACK ! No , dad ! ? Ahhhhhh ! Ahhhhh ! I'm your father , Larry ! ? Your my blood ! ? Ahhhhhh ! ? Ahhhhh ! ? Larry ! Larry ! Larry Sole ! Hey ... Hey , Larry ... Hey , what are you doing way out here , pal ? Huh ? Hey , little buddy . Everything's going to be all right . I wanted it to stop -- I didn't want anymore broken veins under my skin . I didn't want to see my mom all bruised up anymore . We both burned to death that night . Except I'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ... to just walk away . I can't go back . They all know about me . I can't face Juliet ... and Jonny . I've seen guys like Jonny before . They don't know how to love anyone . Hey , Jed -- 'Member the Dogrib story you told me ? The story of how our people came to be ? Yeah . ' Member those kids that made it back to the bag ? The one's that turned back to pups ? Yeah . What did the mother do with them ? She killed them , Larry . A person has maybe three chances in life to stare down the devil right in the eyeballs . This is your most important one . So , don't turn your back . Don't be scared . I would have done the same . ? ( crying ) I'm sorry , Larry - - ? ? ? ... I just said I was pretty good , I learned it up on patrol . ? Stay home , Lare . You don't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? Hey , Larry ! Hey -- Where's Johnny ? Mr . Hay River ? Who cares ! Juliet , I have to tell you something . You wan na dance ? ? DJ : Get crazy ! ? ? I have to ask you something . Okay . How does it feel to have the best ass in town ? ( laughing ) What ? I mean ... Do you wake up smiling , knowing that you break hearts with that ass ? Larry , really , when you think about it , what's an ass even for ? ? Oh , Larry . This is my favourite ! ? ? ? Let's go -- I got ta go get my jacket -- Okay . ? ? You got some guts comin ' here tonight . Listen , man , I'm sorry about your nose . I guess we're even now , eh ? ? WHACK ! WHACK ! Now , we're even . Come on , man , let's go - - ? Larry ? Hey , hang in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming . About what ? A long time ago . A mother said her boy died in a fire . She was so sad that she quit drinking . Became sober . But she became haunted . so she asked her straight out what had happened . So she told her . She said : I see my boy in fire . He wants to die but he's not dead . He's suffering , my boy , and it's all my fault . if her boy had any clothes that he loved ? The Medicine Woman told her that she must burn them . And she must tell her boy to sleep to rest and to die . She made the fire and her boy came . She was crying , she wailed . "" My boy , I'm so sorry . "" And she offered up his clothes to the fire ... and she told him to sleep . To rest , to die . And she never saw him again . ( crying ) ( crying ) Hey ... Shhhh ... . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is ... Juliet home ? She's grounded . ( @knocking_on_door ) What's up , Larry ? The old lady's not in , huh ? Can we talk ? So ... It's getting pretty cold out there , huh ? Yeah , skidoos will start coming out soon . You still got that Phazer ? Lare , I'm being sent to a group home for what I did to you . Just thought you should know that . Juliet is having a kid . Are you serious ? Do I look fucking serious ? She called me up , crying . Shit dude , the whole town knows . She's going to Edmonton . Tomorrow . She's gon na be living with her aunt . Does she want the kid ? Yeah , she says she fucking wants the kid . I don't know , fuck -- You gon na speak to Jonny fuckhead too ? Fuckin ' cock . Won't even speak to her . ... stupid piece of shit ! You ungrateful fucking brat ! Get the fuck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Jon ! Don't bring them back when you're done with them ! Says mother of the year ! What's going on ? Fuck -- Stupid kids ! You freak , man -- Can't talk , Lare -- Dad's here to pick us up . Where are you going ? Back to Hay River ? To Yellowknife . Jon , get in the truck ! What about Juliet ? For fuck's sake , Jon , get in the fucking truck ! What about her ? Jonny - - What about Juliet ? She fucks good . I'm just a kid , Lare -- For fuck's sakes ! Let's go ! Sol later . ? I'm sorry about the dance . I'm not . I knew Jonny was watching . I thought I 'd make him mad . I'm so sorry , Larry . I'm sorry Jonny didn't protect you . It was my fault . But , you can't just leave , Juliet . I want this baby , Larry . Babies , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like running hands over a jigsaw puzzle . How did you survive the fire ? I don't know . Juliet -- Mmhmm . I have this God-shaped hole in my heart . And I think you have one too . ? Larry , I have to go . Wait -- Jed told me once if a Dogrib woman cuts her hair , she has to burn it . If not , when she dies , she has to go back all through her life and pick up every single hair she 'd ever left behind . When Juliet dies , she 'd have to come back , and remember what happened between us , before flying to heaven . I don't know if I'll ever see Juliet or Jonny again -- And I cry for them both . I cry knowing that I don't belong to anyone . But I smile too . Knowing my life is still unwrapped . ? ?

Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior ? I don't know . When you do , he'll be waiting . Okay ? This is where Ray and I sleep , and the bathroom's here . Let's go back in here . Ray's home late tonight . It's poker night . Don't talk to him about Jesus . He acts like he's the repo man or something , not a carpenter like him . You must be the new addition . I'm Ray . Or Uncle Ray , but that's Starr's idea . Not mine . I'm Astrid . It's nice to meet you , Astrid . You coming in ? Well , how come ? I'm thinking . Oh , what about ? My mother . Starr was telling me about her . She's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , those things happen . You come in when you're ready , okay ? That slut said I was grounded , like she's the mother in The Brady Bunch . Listen to that . Saved by Jesus . She's such a hypocrite . They shouldn't be doing it . They're not even married . Reverend Daniels always blah-blahing about Jesus . All he really wants to do is look at her ass . Don't forget to leave the window open . Don't look at me like that . You're no different than I am . You just don't know it yet . I'm gon na kill you , Ingrid ! I'm gon na strangle you , bitch ! You bloody bitch ! Sin is a virus . That's what Reverend Thomas says . It's infecting the whole country like the clap . We've got every excuse . What's wrong if I shovel coke up my nose or want to feel good ? Who does it hurt ? Well , it hurts us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know how you swallow that . "" He who believeth in me , though he was dead , yet will he live . "" Don't forget it . Here we are . It's a miracle I'm not dead . They took my kids away . I was an alcoholic ... - ... a cokehead . I was dancing topless . - People are staring . Oh , Astrid , look ! Look at that . That is gon na go perfect with your new shoes . I mean , I thought : "" Who cares if I hang my tits in a stranger's face ? It's nobody's business . "" You know what ? This is gon na be good on you . Astrid , those are ugly shoes . Snakes don't bite above the ankle . You're better off being bitten by snakes than dressing for them . We need to get her a bra . Carolee had her first bra when she was 9 . You don't want them hanging to your knees when you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that ? Look at that . That is so nice ! Hurry , Astrid , it's here ! I told you you were gon na miss it . Astrid . This one's for you . Who's it from ? My mother . I didn't think she knew where I was . Dear Astrid , have you been getting my letters ? It's been six months . Why don't you write ? It's only a few minutes before they turn out the lights . I can hear the women screaming in their cells . We're both in prison , you and I , punished for our strength and our independence . Don't forget who you are . The best part of me is well-hidden and you have to do the same . Remember it all , every insult , every tear . What are you doing ? I'm writing a letter to my mother . You ever write your dad ? I don't know where he is . I never met him . He left when I was 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No . - Well , aren't you curious ? - I think about what he would think of me . He probably thinks you're still 2 . That's how I remember my son , Seth . - You have a son ? - Yeah . - Hey , Ray . - Hey , Patty . So you're going to the Jesus show ? - Aren't you coming ? - To Bible study ? No . In my opinion , if there's a God , he sure as hell ain't worth praying to . That sounds like something my mother would say . She wouldn't take me to the Christmas pageant . She made me beg a ride off another kid . Hey , Ray . Leanne , hi ! How you doing , Reverend ? I don't think he likes me very much . Why don't you and Starr get married ? ' Cause I'm already married . - Astrid , come on in . We're starting . - Okay , I'm coming . Where's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her or my son in over five years . I baptize you in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit . Amen . Do you believe in God now ? Maybe it's not such a bad thing to believe in something . - It's better to know things . - Why ? What does it get you ? Does it tell you the difference between right or wrong ? She didn't kill that guy alone . I knew what my mother was doing , you know ? I could've saved his life , but I didn't . Come on . I'm gon na kill you , Ingrid ! Open the door ! Think there was something valuable on that hard disk ? Maybe a collection of essays due at the publisher's this fall . You bloody bitch ! You can't do this to me ! You don't know what I can do . Fill out your registration slips . Know your inmate's number . No number , no visit . Hey , baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , no , no , no . Don't cry . We're not like that . We're the Vikings . Remember ? You're so beautiful . Prison agrees with me . There's no hypocrisy here . Kill or be killed , and everybody knows it . Do they hurt you ? Not as much as I hurt them . I won't be in here forever . I promise you that . One day you'll look out your window and I'll be there . Your hair smells like clover . I wan na remember you just like this , in that sadly hopeful pink dress . - Starr picked it out . - Of course she did . What's that ? Nothing . It's just a cross . I know it's a cross . Why are you wearing it ? It's a present from Starr . She force you to go to church ? They're really nice people . It's called the Assembly of God . To join you have to accept Christ as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being washed in the blood of the Lamb . But really , it's just water . Have you accepted Christ as your personal savior ? - There's nothing wrong with Christians . - Are you out of your mind ? How did this happen ? I raised you , not Bible-thumping trailer trash . I raised you to think for yourself . No , you didn't . You raised me to think like you . Maybe thinking for yourself isn't so great . Reverend Daniels says it's evil . Evil ? If thinking for yourself is evil , then every artist is evil . Is that what you believe , now that you're washed in the blood of the Lamb ? - Man's ability to reason is evil ? Am I evil ? - No . No . But killing people who don't want you is evil . We pray for your redemption . Fuck my redemption . I don't want it . I regret nothing . Attention . Visiting hours are over . Visitors , return to the holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify evil , Astrid . But evil is tricky . Just when you think you know what it is , it changes its form . Learning its nature takes a lifetime of study . I will not lose you . Not to them . Those people are the enemy , Astrid . - Visiting hours are over . - Write to me . - Time's up . - Write to me ... - ... at least once a week . - I love you . I'm the only person you know who can keep you honest . - Okay ? - Okay . Don't forget who you are , Astrid . You're my daughter and you're perfect , remember ? How far away is it ? About a mile . Maybe two . Shouldn't we pack up and go ? No , not yet . The wind's still in our favor . My mother used to love fire season . She made me decide what I 'd take if we had to go . She said if I was brave , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . What am I like ? You ? You're a sweetheart . Astrid , honey ? Astrid ? You come on in here a minute ? Well , sit down . I won't bite . You having fun here , aren't you ? Making yourself at home , getting comfortable ? Little too comfortable , I 'd say . I might not be a genius , but I get your game . And it takes one to know one . - One what ? - Always hanging around handling his tools . "" What's this for , Ray ? Can I help you ? "" We're not doing anything . I'm calling Children's Services . - It's all over . - But ... Don't "" but "" me . He is a man . And he sees what he sees , and he does what he can . I've got a nice thing going here . Ray's the best man I ever had . And I've lived too long and come too far to blow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I've got myself and my kids to worry about . We hardly know each other . I don't owe you a thing . - Jesus would give me a chance . - Well , I'm not Jesus . Not even close . He might be mad if he knew you sent me away because you were jealous . You're trying to make him a prisoner . He's gon na hate you . What do you know ? I know that men don't like women who try to own them . I like you . I like the kids . I would never do anything to screw it up . You swear you're not interested in him ? I swear to God . - There . Did you see it ? - I'm not sure . - See anything yet ? - It's just starting . But we should be getting 40 an hour soon . The Quadrantid is the shortest meteorite shower , but the densest . Except for the Perseids . You and Starr , you having a beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it's hard getting older pretty girl coming up in the house . Ray , honey ? What are you doing out here ? Nothing , baby . Just having a smoke . Looking at the stars . And this is $40 , not even $40 a month . - Forty dollars is $40 . - You waste $200 in one night . - You've been doing it weekly . - I won last week . What else are you doing with the money , Ray ? - You can't even look at me . - I'm looking right at you . You weren't . And you've got your car out there . God knows what you spend on that . That comes out of my pocket . - Don't ruin this . - Ruin what ? You didn't come in till 3:00 in the morning . - I was with John . - She's drinking again . And who else ? I saw you eyeing her . Thought you all were going to a movie . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing poker ? - The game got cancelled . - They coming home soon ? - Not too long . Well , there's plenty of food if you want . Thanks . This isn't right . Is everyone gone ? - It is my business ! This is my house ! - It is not ! - Get out of my room ! - You abide by the laws I put down ! I am not gon na get out ! I waited up for you . I want to know who you were with ! Don't give me your shit . You stayed up to drink . - I stayed up to catch you , you whore ! - You should know . Try it again , I'll take you out , bitch . Carolee ! You walk out that door , don't you bother coming back . Why the hell would I want to ? I've been down this road with you before , Mom . Sorry , Davey . I can't go through this again . Carolee .

Get off of me , goddamn it ! Get off of me ! No , Ray ! Goddamn it , Ray . Get off of me ! No , don't cry . We're not like that . We're the Vikings , remember ? Astrid ? Can you talk to me ? Astrid ? Astrid ? Can you talk to me ? Astrid . Talk to me . Can you talk to me ? She's coming around . This boy saved your life . If he hadn't called 911 ... - ... you 'd be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Who shot you ? - I don't know . Hey , watch your feet . - Okay , rug . - Got it . - Where's Ray , Davey ? - He's gone . They're both gone . I'm sorry . I'm so sorry I ruined it . Doesn't matter . Something would have . Bye , Astrid . Okay . One step . - Davey . - We got you , Astrid . Okay , step . We got her . It's okay . We got you . We 'd prefer to find a permanent place , but we have so many children right now . You need special attention , which you'll get at McKinney Hall . They have all sorts of activities for kids . You're dead , bitch ! You hear me ? You're dead . Don't ever look at my boyfriend again . You hear me ? You look at my boyfriend , you're dead ! Next time you and your friends jump me , I'll cut your throats when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I was looking at your picture . It's good . Who is it ? - How come you chopped off your hair ? - None of your business . - You're still beautiful . - Looks don't interest me . That's easy for you to say . You've never been ugly . Look . It's the puta . She's so ugly now . You're not ugly . You write as if you're surprised to find me still beautiful even here . Our beauty is our power , our strength . We can't allow them to change us , to lessen us . I will never grant them that satisfaction and neither should you . So is this your first time in Mac ? Figured . You're so unfriendly . - Life's easier without friends . - Maybe . I like it here . It's better than being in a foster home . It's the floor you can't fall below . - What's that ? - A letter . - From who ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In prison . For murder . - And your father ? - Don't know the guy . How about you ? They were junkies . She OD 'd when I was 6 . He disappeared a couple years later . - I was born addicted to heroin . - Really ? What was that like ? I don't know . I was out of rehab by the time I was six months old . So ... - What's the deal ? Are you gay ? - What ? I don't know . I get this feeling from you , like you're not interested in guys . You're right . I'm not . You think that's funny ? I'm sick of this . I'm not gon na let you do this again . Why don't you shut up ? You're not even in this . - Cut it out . - She does this shit . I'll beat your ass . Wait until we get off the van . - Back off . - I'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - They 'd put us in McKinney Hall . - Hurry . - Come on . Come on , come on . The guy's a genius . I started out copying his stuff , but no ... I could never touch him . He's great . But you're better . You're insane . No , I'm not . I mean , he's a great cartoonist , but you're an artist . What's the difference ? Well , that's like asking why a joke is funny . Either it's funny or it's not . You're either an artist or you're not . You are . It's hard because they keep moving . That's good . Don't look . I'm not done . - There's another one . Do you see it ? - Yeah . The Lyrids shower is visible most of the night . The brightest star is Vega . But you can't look right at it or you'll miss the fainter meteors . You can trace them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A kid I used to know . I used to have a foster home right over there . It's nice living on the beach . Do you ever think about your father ? Not really . He was an asshole . I think about mine sometimes . That when I'm an artist he'll read about me in the papers and he'll want to meet me . I'm not gay . I know that . I'll show you the one that he did of me . It's right here . They're not bad , for what they are . For what they are ? What are they ? Cartoons . No , they're not . They're so much more than that . I mean , he's really talented . - Don't do it again , Astrid . - Do what ? Attach yourself to anyone who shows you the least bit of attention because you're lonely . Loneliness is the human condition . No one is ever going to fill that space . The best you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't let the cattle get in the way . You're not talking about me . You're talking about yourself . Sometimes I get the feeling you don't even want me to be happy . Why wouldn't I want you to be happy ? - Where are they sending you ? - I don't know . Look . The comic book store will hold letters for me . Wherever they take you , keep checking there . Why do we have to go to Mexico to buy this stuff ? It isn't FDA approved . - What's it called ? - DMSO . - What's it for ? - All sorts of things . You'll like these people . She's an actress and he does something with television . - Do they have any kids ? - No . They're looking to adopt . She's had an incredibly hard time . She's very smart . She's just missed a lot of school . - You don't have to decide immediately . - Okay . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , just let me know . There you are . I'm really sorry Mark couldn't be here to meet you . He's filming in Nova Scotia . Well , this is it . I left it plain on purpose because I thought that way , you know , you could put your own things up . - I like the D ? rer watercolor . - You know who D ? rer is ? - My mother's an artist . - Oh , that's right . Of course . Of course . They said that . Hey , listen . Do you want some tea or something ? Or Pepsi . I bought Pepsi . I didn't know what you 'd drink . We have juice . I could make you a smoothie , if you like . Would you like a smoothie ? Tea is fine . Okay . I look , I look . Stop . Look ... And now I die . - You were really good . - Do you know what a nightmare it is ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready drag yourself to this audition . They look at you for two seconds and tell you that you're too ethnic , or too classic , too something . Too ethnic ? It means brunette . And too classic means old .

You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , it's fine . No , you did really well . You did really , really well . What was the best day of your life ? Today . - What should we do later ? - I don't know . What do you want to do ? Swim ? Okay . Oh , my God ! He's back early . Mark . Hey . Hi . You must be Astrid . It took us three hours to get him back . The whole film crew's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he thought it was gon na come back and finish him off . - What would you have done if it had ? - Ducked . Come on . Okay , here we go . Perfect . Just , just right there . Thanks . - Well , cheers . - Cheers . Cheers , Astrid . So we've got some catching up to do . Claire tells me you're quite an artist . - Not really ... - She's wonderful . In fact , Tricia Day accepted Astrid for one of her watercolor classes . - At the museum ? - She loves Astrid's work . You should show him . They're really , really beautiful . She's never even studied . She's self-taught . Is that right ? Is she all right ? - I know you're perfect . - I'm not perfect . Of course you are . You're my daughter . Hey . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Just thinking . - Are you getting my letters ? - Yes . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why doesn't she have any children ? She can't have them . You dress like her now . She takes me shopping . What's her husband like ? He's nice . He's gone a lot . So you spend most of your time with Claire ? Yeah . I 'd like to meet her . Why ? Because you don't want me to . Who did this belong to ? That was my great aunt's on my father's side . She was a field nurse at Ypres . Very , very brave woman . It's pretty , isn't it ? - And whose was this ? - It was my mother's . My father gave it to her . My parents were completely inseparable . Not at all like Mark and I . I hate it when he has to go away for so long . - Why don't you go with him ? - He says it slows him down . - I think it's because he's having an affair . - He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . If he did , I would never know about it . You're just being paranoid . Yeah , that's what he says . That can be very negative . - Should I put this here ? - Yeah , perfect . Everything ready inside ? - You're leaving tomorrow ? - In the morning . I bet Claire would love to go with you . Coordinating our schedules is difficult . She's not working . I mean , she could fit into yours . What about you ? Doesn't she need to be here for you ? Yeah . How is she these days , when I'm gone ? She okay ? She's fine . - Why do you ask ? - No reason . You're back early . How long has my mother been writing you ? Not long . We've only written to each other a couple of times . - Why didn't you tell me ? - She asked me not to . Well , she thought that you wouldn't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . And God , she's talented . We 'd like to meet . Whose idea was that ? Mine . I bet . - You know , I really love your work . - What have you seen ? Astrid showed me the collages and some of your earlier work in the catalogues . Oh , I love the Polaroid installation . Really ? Why ? I don't know . Well , because ... Well , because it's great . - I'm actually very visual myself . - A kindred spirit . It must be difficult for you to work here . It is . I spend so much time fighting off sexual advances I hardly have time to think . That was a joke . - Jailbird humor is hard to get sometimes . - Sorry . So , you're an actress . - So glamorous . - No , my career is a disaster . I think it's the process . It , you know , may be too painful for me . You're such a sensitive person , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your self-esteem . I'm a typical Pisces , but that's why Astrid and I get on so well . Scorpio and Pisces understand each other . You're into astrology ? She's not into astrology just because she knows our signs . Astrid and I used to understand each other . But she's become so secretive . Astrid isn't secretive at all . We talk about everything , all the time . We just love her . She's doing so well . She's on the honor roll and we're just working to keep that old grade point average up . Put a pyramid over her desk . It improves memory . - My memory's fine . - A pyramid ? I hadn't thought of that . I do practice feng shui , though . You never mentioned that in your letters . How about your husband ? Is he into feng shui as well ? No , he's into frequent flier miles . He's gone half the time . That's not so bad , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great comfort to you not being able to have children of your own . Yeah . Yeah . She is . Would you mind letting us talk alone , sweetie ? Grown-up things . - Don't we have to go ? - No , it's okay . We have time . Love humiliates you . Hatred cradles you . It's soothing . What did you say to her ? She's having trouble with her husband . It's not you , is it ? I know you have an attraction for older men . No , it's not me . - You leave her alone . - But it's such fun . Easy , but fun . In my present situation I have to get fun where I can . God , how can you stand to live with poor Claire ? Did you know there's an entire order called the Poor Clares ? She is a genuinely nice person . You don't know what it's been like . - lf you love me , you'll help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the worst kind of foster hell than living with that woman . What can you possibly learn from her ? How to pine artistically ? Twenty-seven names for tears ? All I can say is keep your bags packed . I don't feel like it . I'm a stranger in my own house . You live here and I stay here once in a while . - Maybe if you gave a little bit . - I give . Why can't I give to her , why can't I be here ? - Because I work ! Because I have a job . - That's not fair . I give you everything you ask for and it's not enough . No , not everything . Not everything . You promised things would change . - Mark , I'm trying , you know I'm trying . - Trying's not good enough . You're falling apart . We are back to where we started . It is not working out and I think we should send her back . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go ? - They'll find someplace . You're gon na send her away ? You take everything away , don't you ? - You just leave me with nothing . - Jesus Christ , you are such a bad actress . I really almost forgot . Okay , okay . All right , I'll send her back , okay ? We can try that . Just don't go , okay ? Just don't leave me . Unlike you , Claire , I work . Remember ? And she going with you , your girlfriend ? I've had it with this , Claire . I've really had it . Astrid ? Astrid . Astrid , please . Claire ? Are you awake ? I'm sorry . Are you all right ? Yeah . Take my advice . Stay away from broken people . You can't send me back . He's not coming back , Astrid . He's gon na divorce me . You know , Claire , it wouldn't be the worst thing . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Come on . Okay . Stay with me , okay ? Stay with me , please . Claire . Claire . Claire , wake up ! Claire ! God ! Claire , please . No ! Astrid . What is it ? I'm back in Mac . - Didn't they tell you ? - No . Claire's dead . She killed herself . - I'm sorry . - No , you're not . - You poisoned her too , but with words . - I told her what she already knew . You were just jealous . Of course I was jealous . I live in a cell with a woman who has a vocabulary of 25 words . Why do you think they got you ? To create a perfect family ? People get babies for that . Not teenagers recovering from bullet wounds . You were on suicide watch . Don't think it's the first time she tried it . It's just the first time she pulled it off . I'm not coming back .

Your mother said you 'd be difficult . - Mother knows best . - You've been through a terrible ordeal . Three foster homes , the shooting , the suicide of a foster mother . I understand you were close . Did you ask your client about her involvement with that ? You can't blame her for the death of a woman she met once . But I do blame her , Susan . That's pretty cynical , Astrid . You want me to lie for her in court , is that it ? Why do you hate her , Astrid ? Because you think she committed murder ? Or because you feel abandoned ? Talk to her . People do change . You should hear the way she talks about you . She worries about you . She asked me to find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car ? There's money behind her . Just tell me what you want . You are stupid girl . You walk away from money to punish mother . You want car ? You want art college ? All costs money . You don't know anything about this , Rena , so just stay out of it . - I have plan for you , anyway . - Yeah ? What's that ? Niki leave soon . And Yvonne is stupid girl . Making third baby . Every time she look at the window to see baby's face , baby gone . Then she cries like it's a big surprise . But you , you're a special girl . You stay , I make you partner . Stay here ? What , you got better place to go ? Then go see mother . She need something from you , you need something from her . Go get it . Here she comes . Astrid , my God ! What's wrong , Mom ? You don't like my outfit ? I'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s the story ? We didn't go to Mexico to buy DMSO ? Barry beat you ? He raped me ? How bad does he have to be to get you out of jail ? I can't believe what's happened to you . When I get out , I'll make it up . Who said you're getting out ? I said I 'd talk to you . I didn't say I 'd do it . Then what do you want ? I have a deal to make . A trade . You tell me the truth , I'll lie for you in court . - The truth about what ? - Everything you kept from me . - And if I don't ? - Then you can rot in here . I hate this look , by the way . You're a Sunset Boulevard motel , a $20 hooker in the back of a car . Why did you murder Barry ? If I submit to this , you'll testify ? Yes . Self-defense . He was killing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her ? Claire went after herself . I just showed her how to do it . Who was my father ? Why do you always ask that ? It's ancient history . It's my ancient history . Who was he ? His name was Klaus Anders . - What 'd he do ? - He was an artist . How did you meet ? At Venice Beach , at a party . He had the drugs . Did you love him ? It was a long time ago . I'm not the same person . Liar . You're exactly the same . Answer the question . You're such a child , taking my propaganda for truth . So set me straight . Did you love him ? We had a very sexual relationship . One overlooks many things . You worshipped him . I read it in your journal . "" Worship "" isn't exactly the word we're looking for here . Who is Annie ? What ? Who is Annie , Mother ? She was a neighbor who took in kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like ? - Dark , curly hair , freckles . Did she take care of me ? How can you possibly have remembered this ? It will only hurt you . Imagine my life for a moment . How unprepared I was to be the mother of a small child . I was used to having time to think and you just wanted , wanted , wanted . I felt like a hostage . Can you understand how desperate I was ? I dropped you off at her house one afternoon to go to the beach with some friends . And one thing led to another . They had a place in Ensenada . It was wonderful . You can't imagine . To take a nap in the afternoon to make love all day if I wanted and not have to think : What's Astrid doing ? Where's Astrid ? Mommy , Mommy clinging to me like a spider . At the end , I just wanted to throw you against a wall . How long were you gone ? About a year . Give or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You're not asking the right question . Don't ask me why I left . Ask me why I came back . You should've been sterilized . I could've left you there but I didn't . Don't you understand ? For once , I did the right thing . When I came back , you knew me . You were sitting by the door . You looked up and you reached for me . It was as if you 'd been waiting for me all along . I was always waiting for you . That's the constant in my life . Waiting for you . Will you come back ? Will you forget that you tied me up in front of a store or left me on a bus ? - Are you still waiting ? - No . I stopped when Claire showed me what it felt like to be loved . What did you think ? That I would amuse you ? That's what babies are like , Mother . Did you think we 'd talk about Joseph Brodsky ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam and Eve in a vine-covered shack . I was crazy . - You were in love with him . - I was , all right ? I was in love with him , baby makes three and all that crap . Then why did you leave him ? - Why did you leave him ? - I didn't leave him . He left me . You wan na know about your father ? He left us when you were six months old for another woman . I never saw him again until he came looking for you when you were 8 . - He came to see me ? - Yes , he did . But it was too late . Why should I let him see you after what he did to me ? It wasn't about you ! It was about me and I wanted to see him ! My whole life I've wanted to see him . That decision was mine , not yours ! Everything's always been about you , never about me . I knew you were gon na kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn't give a damn about what that would do to me . I'll say whatever Susan wants , but I got ta go . You don't just walk away from me . I made you . I'm in your blood . You don't go anywhere until I let you go . Then let me go . You look at me and you don't like what you see . But this is the price , Mother . The price of belonging to you . If I could , I 'd take it all back . I would . Then tell me you don't want me to testify . Tell me you don't want me like this . Tell me you would sacrifice the rest of your life to have me back the way I was . Listen , forget it . A deal's a deal . Let's just leave it at that . Excuse me . It's probably a waste of time but I'm looking for someone who used to come here . His name's Paul Trout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd turn up . Thanks . - What's going on ? - I don't know . - Excuse me . Is it a recess ? - No . Jury's out . Don't you need me to testify ? Your mother told me to leave you alone . What happened ? She let me go . Two years after Paul and I moved to New York I received a letter from my mother . In it was the Los Angeles Times Magazine , my mother on the cover . A Santa Monica gallery had mounted a showing of her work . The Times included seven pages of her hauntingly distant prison collages . She stares out from the cover , the bars of her cell behind her . Beautiful . Dangerous . Proud . The Times said she was close to winning a retrial after a first failed appeal . They called her show a triumph . It's too much to imagine her tempering her joy with a moment of grief a moment for what that triumph had cost . These suitcases are a map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so I find myself thinking of her wanting to feel that wind . It's a secret wanting like a song I can't stop humming or loving someone you can never have . No matter how much she's damaged me no matter how flawed she is I know my mother loves me . [ENGLISH]

"" Dear Celie , the reason why I am in Africa is because ... "" ... one of the missionaries who was supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel ... "" ... to help with the children and setting up the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in her place . "" I wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship . On my first sight of the Africa coast something struck in my soul , like a large bell . Ijust vibrated . It has been a long time since I had time to write , but always no matter what I'm doing , I'm writing you . Dear -- Celie ! Bring me a cool drink . Olinka is four days march through the bush from the harbor . Do you know what ajungle is ? Trees and trees and more trees on top of that . They are so big , they look like they were built . And vines and ferns and animals and noises that make you wonder what is lurking behind the shadows of every bush . We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of millet , porridge and fruit , then morning classes . We teach the children English , reading , writing history , geography , arithmetic and Bible stories . The older children are used to going to mission school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here screaming and kicking . They're all boys . Olivia's the only girl . There is a little African girl called Tashi . She plays with Olivia . "" Why can't Tashi come to school ? "" She asked me . I told her the Olinka don't believe in educating girls . She said , quick as a flash : "" Like white people at home who don't want black people to learn . "" She is sharp , Celie . When Tashi can get away from her chores she and Olivia hide in my hut . To Olivia right now , Tashi alone is Africa ... . Everything she learns , she shares with Tashi . Sound familiar ? At first , there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest . A kind of low humming . Then chopping and the sound of dragging . Then the scent . Some days there's smoke . Now , after two months during which I or the children or Corrine has been sick all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon class burst out as he entered : "" The road approaches ! "" Dear Celie , the white man is building a road . It reached the cassava fields nine months ago . The morning after the road was done , as far as Olinka was concerned what should we discover , but that the road builders were back . They have instructions to continue the road for another 30 miles and continue it right through the village of Olinka . The road builders didn't deviate an inch from the head man's plan . Every hut that lay in the road's path was leveled . Celie , our church , our school my hut all went down in a matter of hours . But the worst is yet to be told . Sweet Corrine ... died from fever and grief . We buried her in the Olinka way . But Celie , my dear sweet sister we'll all be coming home once we work something out with U.S . Immigration . They don't know if we're American , African , or missionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunset . What's with you ? I was calling you for an hour ! Now get my shave and don't keep me waiting ! - Where's Celie ? - Home fixing to shave Mister . You got a fever ? I didn't come here for you to take all day to shave me . Get the molasses out of your ass ! The longer I'm married to you , the slower and dumber you get . Your ass as slow as I ever seen it before . Celie ! Ain't that razor sharpened yet ? Get out here and do me right now ! Get out here ! All right . Put your head back . Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears . That razor looks dull to me , Miss Celie . Damn women . How you feeling , Miss Sofia ? Confused . Ain't you glad to be home ? Maybe . - Now come the time for me to tell you . - What ? It's time for us to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It's time to move on . - Celie is coming with us . - What ? Celie is coming to Memphis with us . Over my dead body ! You satisfied ? That's what you want ? Now what's wrong with you ?

If he hadn't been your boy he might have been a halfway decent man . Say what ? You took my sister Nettie away from me . You knew she was the only person in the world who loved me . But Nettie and my kids are coming home soon . And when we get together , we're going to whip your ass . Nettie and your kids ? Woman , you talking crazy . I got children . My children are living in Africa . Africa ! Learning different languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out better than these fools you never tried to raise . - Hold on here ! - No "" hold on "" , Harpo .

Made my life here hell . Your daddy ain't nothing but some dead horseshit . Shut up ! It's bad luck for a woman to laugh at a man ! My God , the dead has arisen . I had enough bad luck to keep me laughing the rest of my life . Sitting in that jail , I near about done rot to death . I know what it like , Miss Celie . Want to go somewhere and can't .

Albert , no . Take out her slop jar , maybe cook her food . You ain't even that good a cook . She's a lot better than that first wife of yours . This house ain't been cleaned good since my first wife died . Nobody's crazy enough to marry you . So what will you do ? Hire yourself to farm ? Maybe someone will let you work on their railroad .

Smiling down on me ? ? You're smiling down on me ? Dear mom , did you ever wonder about the moment you became you ? I've been thinking about that lately . I mean , the moment that decides how we forever look at the world . I remember that moment perfectly . Mom , what are those ? For me , it was with you . They're picture frames . See in that one , a little boy's getting a bedtime story from his grandpa . Up there , they're putting up the Christmas tree . Boxes of light . Windows into life . Every frame begs me for a story . Uhhh ... You okay over there ? I don't know . I mean , I just don't , I feel like I'm flying blind . I don't know if the colors I'm using are right . I don't know . Well , if you're really nice you could ask for help . Really ? Sure , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this . Do you have one of those kits that they use on you ? Of course . I never leave home without it . I just got a new one yesterday . Kind of magical . It's basically the secret to my entire career is this little box . Almost anyone can use it , but no one knows about it . There's this really special red color . Comes in a little tiny box of eight . I could just paint that on you . Look at that . See you wouldn't have to do that . It would stay all day that crayon . Thank you . Thank you for that invaluable help . They just delivered our tree . Ha , really ? I hadn't noticed . Have you got your one yet ? Now why would a girl who lives alone need a tree ? You could put my present under it . But seriously though , like , I don't know , like , on video , is like , should I be wearing more blush . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gon na ... Look , I wouldn't worry about it . It's face time . I mean , you're basically just going to be a frozen image . Like an Emoji . Smile Emoji , sad Emoji , raise the roof Emoji . Your bras are going to raise the roof . Is there a bra Emoji ? Why didn't they send a real crew though , you know ? Like they do for me ? Okay , I've got an idea . You can do it , right ? - I mean you love my bras . - I do . You just talk about how much you love them . Girls around the country will want you to love their bras . It'll work really well . Problem is the only thing I can describe is how to take them off . - Mm , are you ready ? - No ! Stop it . Stop it . Oh , not that ready . Okay , do I look okay ? Is it ... seriously . Just ... hold on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! - No , no , no . - You look fine . Okay , okay . Hey , guys . Joining us live from her stunning home in New York City to talk about her new haute couture bra line that is tearing up the runways , ladies and gentlemen is ... Georgina Scott . Georgina , welcome . Gosh , you look phenomenal and I can't even see your bra . Well , thank you . You sure know what to say to a girl . Thank you so much . I'm really excited to talk to you guys . My goodness , what is going on ? Fashion week has been all abuzz about your bras . Who knew there was so much new to do with boob support ? Well , never underestimate a woman's love of dressing up , even when she's undressed . Now , I thought we had seen it all with Victoria's secret and their diamond bras . Tell us , what has everyone so excited ? Well , look , I'm a gal who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amazing works of art , but I wanted to create something that every woman could buy and own and have that same wow factor in their own bedroom . We use hand-printed silks . We use antique lace , uh , vintage Czech crystals . I wanted to sort of do a tip of hat to the most beautiful and ethereal styles of the past that inspired me all my life . I've never seen bras made of this fabric or design . They're so sophisticated , like you can wear them in the street . I think that every piece of clothing that goes on your body should be as beautiful as possible . Not just functional , but infused with the art of fashion . Now , speaking of fashion and supermodels , you are dating the absolutely resplendent Sebastian . The iconic face of Bateau Cologne . So , we're guessing , Georgina , that he's probably your first Guinea pig , am I right ? Um , let's just say that he's supportive of my work and leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies get our hands on these ? Well , all gals and maybe some guys can get their hands on them , uh , starting tomorrow on fifth Avenue and this weekend across the nation . Georgina Scott , always a pleasure . Congrats on your success , and look , I know now what my wife is getting for her birthday . The pleasure was all mine . Thank you so much you guys . Coming up , a revealing new interview with Russell Crowe . You won't want to ... Whew ! So ... Well , that was amazing . Yay ! Well , they did all the heavy lifting , but more importantly , how 'd I look ? Like every man was fantasizing about what bra you were wearing ? You're blowing up . Oh ... Becca , the service is over and we're back at the house now . Everyone's asking for you . Please come . I know you're upset . I , we didn't get a chance to finish . I need to explain , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scott , I hope you haven't been waiting too long . Georgina , please . Couture has decided to do a feature on your spring line in our may issue , featuring a June bride theme . How do you feel about that ? I think that's fantastic news , oh my god . Thank you so much . Good , well we're all very excited about it over here . In fact , I have a fan who 'd very much like to meet you . Hello Ms . Scott . It is such a pleasure to meet you . I attended your show during fashion week and I just wanted to say that I thought it was so incredible . Thank you . You know , you look familiar . Do we know each other somehow ? Oh , um , the pig and cow building . - Of course . - I live there , too . Wow , what a small world , right ? Oh , so nice to meet you . Bye ! Do you have any children , Georgina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Well , it's impossible not to mess up , even when you do everything right . Nah , looks like you did everything right . Anyway , send me your sketches as soon as you can and we'll see what we can do to do a gorgeous splashy layout . That sounds perfect . Thank you so much . ? I don't ask for too much ? ? you can't keep up , you can't keep up , you can't keep up ? ? and up ? Becca , come on . We've got the reading of the will tomorrow . I ... will you just let me know you're okay ? Can you call us ? Alright , I love you . Bye . Hello ? Hi ? I'm home . What are you doing ? Hey ! Just finishing up some work . What are you doing ? Just gon na cook you some dinner . What are you doing ? Hi . We can't afford any of this stuff . Oh , no this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new recipes . My god , Kevin . Who cares about new recipes ? Well this thing is gon na rise or fall because of the recipes . That's cute , that's really cute . Why don't you keep punning your way into bankruptcy and we are going to have to go and live , you know , with your grandma in Newark . Would you please stop worrying so much ? I'm sure we're going to get a call from the loan guy really soon . Be able to set up that nice little space in Soho - we talked about . - Who are we kidding ? You are a straight guy who wants to sell pastries in lower Manhattan ? That doesn't exactly sound like a slam dunk . And meanwhile , we're almost all the way through our savings and you're creating new recipes ? I hardly think a few hundred dollars worth of truffle oil is going to put us over the edge . Well that's the point ! It's not just a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . I can understand why you're nervous . You don't understand ! Because I am the person who has to work an actual job while you get to just smell and taste your way into this fantasy world . You know this wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I stormed out of my parents ' house to be with you . I wanted to stay that vibrant , irreverent person . And now I'm policing your groceries ? I mean god damn it , Kevin , I really want to start our adult life together , and you just made me into the person who has to clean everything up . Rigby ! Quinn . - Hey . - Hi . What's all this ? Uh , the vinyl towers . It's a set I built for you . Oh , you're a carpenter , too ? Well , lucky for us then . What the hell is it ? Well , it was from an interview that I read of yours , where you said you related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' 60s , ' 70s vinyl . More analog than digital . So it's kind of throwback , but all you . - Alright . - Okay . Come on . Thank you . Head down . Turn to the left . ? She ain't walking to the city , to the city for somehow ? Good ! Yes ! Wait ! ? Give me fire , give me water ? Good . Yes ! Hey , Becca , where are you ? I know you're confused and hurt . And I am too . I'm here . I know it makes you feel good , but you do know that weed is a carcinogen , right ? Hey , cool , ' cause that's what what worries me most right now . Thanks . Don't you hate smelling like a frat house when you go to work ? Sorry you have to see me lower myself to stoner status . There's a picture of you on Quinn's site from the concert . You should check it out , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will never hear the end of it from my mother . Too late . Your parents probably have your apartment wired with hidden cameras anyway . She's going to lose your mind when she finds out where you're working . Please . She would never be caught dead south of 63rd street . Downtown might as well be another country to her . Besides , don't you want people to see how cool you look ? I do look pretty cool . See ? Hi . Yeah , I'm fine . Yes , that's me . Told you . Uh huh . Got the tickets at work . Shh ! What ? T-that's not a guy , mom . That's Tricia Williams . Yeah , my roommate from Andover . Remember ? We're on facetime . I've got ta go . Yeah , she's having some personal problems and I'm helping her out with some stuff . Well , good of you to help out an old friend . So where did she end up ? Rutgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good waste of prep school education . Stop it , mother . She got into Yale early decision , same school that waitlisted me . - Yes . - Not everyone can afford Ivy . But you are a Princeton grad , in the entry program of Wells and Kinney . Yes , you know what , I did graduate from Princeton , where I magically made it off the wait list , and I did magically get into the most competitive entree program in all of Manhattan . I have to go , mom . But the markets are closed ! Look , I thought maybe we could hang out a little bit and , you know , I 'd like to hear all about what's going on . Nope , still working . I'm making a delivery for one of the partners . Delivery ? Yeah . That's how they break us in . Can you believe the bastards ? I got ta catch the subway . I'm gon na lose you . Why don't you take a cab or , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey . - Okay ? - Yeah . Tony ? Tony ! Will you set the table please ? Dinner time . Every time . Did you hear from Becca today ? What do you think ? I think it's time for me to call her . Don't . She's mad at me . She's gon na be just as mad at me when she finds out the truth . You know , this isn't just happening to you . I know that , Peter . I don't know what to do . Maybe we should just let her process things and come to us when she's ready . How is she gon na process it if she doesn't know everything is what I'm saying . Well she's not gon na talk to you either . Maybe . Tony , how do you feel about leaving your aunt Becca a message ? She's not my aunt Becca . - Come on . - You guys are liars . You lied to her and you lied to me . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wouldn't all be living a total and complete lie . Don't talk to your mother that way . I can't believe how weak you guys are . You lied . You could've just told us the truth . Oh yeah ? You have no idea what you're talking about . You're right , dad . I don't know what I'm talking about because you never tell me anything . No , no . Let him be . Let him be . Early birthday present . What ? Wan na look ? Yes ! What is it ? Is that Times Square ? But not just Times Square , this is gon na be everywhere . What you did on that shoot was magical . You really captured him . Quinn and his team wants your images to define him from now on . Across the planet . And Quinn wants to hire you . - No . - Mhm . Really ? Why ? For what ? Well , um , for some more shoots obviously , but uh , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , um , I don't wan na , you know , rain on your parade , but um ... My ex and I we tried to give it another shot for the boy's sake . You have a son ? And I thought you hated your ex . Hate is a strong word . You said , I hate my ex . Well ... I hated the fact that I had to get married with her because she was , you know ... Right . But Hal is here now , and I need to be a decent dad . I'm sorry . Oh ! The truth is , you stole my thunder . I was gon na dump you , but then you come in here with this great news and now I can't be mad at you . Phew ! Well , I got ta go . K . Bye . Oh . - Bye . - K . - Hey . - What are you doing ? Can't sleep . Me too . Milk ? No , thanks . Oh my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some c-span actually . Well , better than milk . Hey . Hi , Pete . Hey . Thank you for calling . You okay ? Yeah , I just uh ... I don't know how I'm supposed to feel right now . Mad , confused , sad . Million questions . Everything I guess . Yeah , I guess that sums it up . Um ... Beth doesn't know I'm calling you , but ... Oh , please . I can't . I can't talk to her right now . - I just ... - I know , but ... Do not defend her . Jesus . She had thirty-three years to tell me this and she , she waits until my mother's funeral to tell me that the woman I'm grieving is not my mother , who is my grandmother . And she's not my sister , she's my mother . I-I ... It's a lot to take in , huh ? I can't . I don't know how to wrap my head around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve wrapped my head around it for a long time . Yeah , I was uh , I was wondering if you knew . If you knew this whole time and you just ... Yeah , you just uh , never told me . You know what , Becca ? Just hold on a second cause this is a hard thing . What ? What is hard for you ? Look , you remember I came back from the war , I started dating Beth . Right ? Yeah , you met at the VFW Christmas dance thing . Yeah , well ... Yeah , we met at a dance , but it was a high school dance . I was 17 and Beth was 15 . And your grandmother wouldn't let me see Beth anymore after she got pregnant . She blamed me . I went off and joined the army to get as far away as I could and ... - Seriously ? - Just listen to me . What ? But I was not trying to get away from Beth or from you . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? You're my daughter , too . How could you do this ? How could you both do this ? All of these years , why ? Because it was the only way that Alice , that your ... That your grandmother would allow us to be in your life at all . Look , I missed the first ten years of your life . And as soon as I got out of the army , I came straight home and I married Beth and we stayed in that house and we were around you as much as we possibly could be . How could you do this to us ? I mean , how could you do this to Tony ? That poor kid . I'm sorry . I'm very , very sorry . But you got ta know this is torture for us , too . This was torture for me , you know . And I didn't love you any less . I mean , maybe it was different on that outside . Maybe it looked different on the outside . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I um ... I feel like the earth has just dropped out beneath me . I can't ... Well , it has , sweetie , but you are not gon na sink . I promise . We're not gon na let you . Oh , don't you promise me anything . I don't believe a word you say to me . I don't wan na talk to you anymore . Don't call me . - Tell Beth not to call me . - Becca , please . I will have someone proxy for me at the will reading . Becca , you ... Beth . He's at Becca's . He went to Becca's . Why did she send that to you and not me ? She's still mad at you . And ... I think it's good they spend some time alone now . She's worried about him . What do you mean ? Did you talk to her ? Yeah , we spoke last night . Did you tell her ? I had to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , please . I haven't seen you in a while . Yeah , I figured with all this weird Asian pig virus thing going around that I should probably come in . Okay . Still a non-smoker ? Drinks per week . Depends on the week . Um , three to five . Okay . You definitely have a fever . And considerable inflammation . Uh , no strep . Probably the flu . Oh ! Says you got a birthday next week . 37 ? Okay , so children maybe . Children ? No . No , no . No . I , uh , I don't even have a houseplant . No , I travel way too much and when I'm home , my hours are insane . I don't even have a dog and I 'd really like a dog . Look , Rigby , you're gon na have to find a new doctor . Oh , geez . I am really sorry I didn't come in for the flu shot - this last year . - No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an obstetrician . You're pregnant . What ? No , that's impossible . Look , we'll have to confirm with a blood test . No , but we always used a condom . You ever wonder what's on the other side of that 97% effective . Welcome to the 3% . How long do I have ? Jesus , it's not a death sentence . No , it's a life sentence . - What ? - Okay , okay . I can see you're stressed out . I'm gon na write you an antiviral for the flu . And here's the name of a great ob . Right . Good luck . Now can you show me which one is the red one . That was pretty stupid , you know . I know . Beth's going crazy right now . I know . I just couldn't be around them . Kids are supposed to lie to their parents . Not the other way around . Yeah , well ... It's so screwed up . Tony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I don't wan na do this now . I wanted to tell you every single day . My hands were tied . I don't believe that mom or grandma or whatever the hell I'm supposed to call her now . I don't believe that she would want this for us . There's a lot you don't know about your grandparents . Well , apparently my whole life is based on a lie so ... Make that times two . Is it a lie that we love you ? Both of you ? I wasn't strong enough to stand up to her . I wasn't . But she was my mother and I was 15 and scared . She took Peter away from me . I can't handle this . I have a trial in two days that I'm not prepared for so I can't do this with you today . Okay . You know where I am . Come on , Tony . You know what , Becca , this really isn't a tragedy . It's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to breathe in thirty years . Hey , if you 'd ever gotten pregnant , would you have considered termination ? What a terribly strange thing to ask me . What do you mean ? What do you mean , what do I mean ? Well , what are you asking me ? What are you trying to say ? Well , what do you think I'm saying ? You think I'm saying that I wan na have a baby ? Seriously look , if I wanted to have a baby with you , I 'd tell you , I wan na have a baby with you . So have you been reading my emails ? Why would I read your emails ? I don't know . Seems like an awfully strange question to come up - out of the blue . - It's Rigby . I saw her today . I'm supposed to keep it a secret . She's pregnant . Really ? I didn't even know that she was seeing anybody . She was . She's not anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out whether she wants to keep it or not . I got this email the other day . I've been trying to figure out how to tell you about it . Here it goes . Dear nm45729 , what is this ? Just keep reading . I recently submitted a request to the state adoption board for a copy of my family medical history . And I learned they had little on file , but said they would forward a message if they could . If you're reading this , then you're my biological mother . I don't wish to know your identity and I'm not ready to give you mine , but I have some questions about my health and I wondered if you could tell me a little bit about anything I should be aware of on you or my father's side . I have no record of who my father might be . You should know that I have wonderful parents and I'm very happy . Thank you . Nc45729 . I never told you about it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend that it happened to someone else . It's your private life , you know , before you met me . No obligation to tell me anything . But I love you . So if you wan na tell me , I'm here . Okay ? Twenty-three years ago , I was completely lost . And I uh , and I fell for this guy . This musician who convinced me to go on tour with him as his girl , so ... We were on the road for a few months and I was not prepared for that lifestyle . I mean , there were so many drugs and there were some really weird parties and really ... Things . Anyway , after , after a couple months I couldn't take it anymore and I left and I went back home . And then I uh , I realized that I was pregnant . And I really couldn't say who the father was . I couldn't even take care of myself . And uh , there was no one to help me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her up . Ever regret that ? Everyday . What do I say to her ? Hi , I'm your mother . I was a complete slut and I don't know who your father is . Do you wan na meet her ? I don't know . I just ... Maybe . You don't need to rush it . Give her the information she wants . And if you need to meet her , you'll both figure it out at some point . It's gon na be okay . I really want us to see each other again , but I don't want her to find out that we're still talking . It's not exactly the kind of thing that fosters trust in a marriage . Well , just give me a little bit of time to figure out how to make that happen . Me too . Okay . Oh , hey . I'm sorry I woke you up . No , it's alright I ... I couldn't ... I couldn't sleep . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the loan guy called . I didn't get it . Oh my god , baby . I'm so sorry . It's okay , it's okay . It's okay . - I'm sorry . - It's okay . Hey listen , I've been thinking about something . Um , I was thinking about what you said earlier about leaving your parents and you're right . You stood up for me , you know , you ... You took a chance that I would be the guy that you 'd hope for . Isn't that what people in love do ? Yeah . Yeah , but what they don't do , or what they shouldn't do is ask the people they love to give up other people that they love . No , that ... It didn't have anything to do with you . That was my choice . But I let it happen so I feel like it was our choice . And it was a mistake . Look , I know that it's very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like you have a little bit of pity for me , can I ask you a favor ? Well , you can always ask . I want you to call your parents . No . Why ? Listen ... After my mother died , there hasn't been a single day that's gone by that I don't think about what it would've been like to share every single moment with her . The good and the bad . And it's just too much burden for me to feel like I am the reason that you don't talk to your parents and god forbid something should happen to them . Kevin . No . Not after the way they treated you . No . Look , they never treated me badly , Gayle . Being careful about bringing somebody into your family , that's admirable . That's not judgmental . And look at me . I mean , they were right to be worried about their daughter's future . I don't blame them for that . I just ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the best for you . And I just want you to think about it . I'm just being selfish because I'm thinking maybe we can move in with your parents . It's better than living in my grandma's closet in Newark . I will think about it . Thank you . How was it tonight ? Pretty tame . Made some good tips though . How are you feeling ? Super tired . I slept the whole day so now I can't really sleep . What are you watching ? Just channel surfing . Still pretty wound up from today . What are you eating ? Chocolate brownie . Your faves . I'm kinda tight with the sous chef so he made me a batch . Speaking of which , I'm gon na send you some . Thanks . Hey . Don't worry , okay ? Someone's gon na be a match . You know what I 'd like ? I 'd like to know what it feels like to have a man be in love with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or how I make him feel about himself . Me . What if I don't get to feel that ? I think some people live really long lives that never get to feel that . I'm scared , too . You know why I called you ? I mean , after all this time . To save me from a lifetime of debauchery ? Um , I guess because we've been best friends forever . You're the last person that I know that really loved me . My mom said that once when she came up to campus . You remember that weird modern dance recital that we were in ? She said afterward that she thought that we seemed like sisters . You know that place I was telling you about in Chinatown is getting a new shipment in from Hong Kong . I was thinking about using some of my tip money and going to buy some new Brocade and Boucle . Only you can get that excited about fabrics . Okay , I mean I was gon na make you something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash then you're on your own . Sorry . Come on in . Take a seat . Uh , so uh , I just wanted to say thanks , uh , in person for what you've done for me . Uh , I know what I do with music , but those pictures , you really , you really captured something . Well , thanks . Thanks . I mean , you were the one that inspired it all so really were just a great team . I want you on my tour . Six months . Wow . That's amazing . Um ... Yeah , it would be amazing to have that kind of time to , you know like , tell a real story . Yeah , something amazing . So , yeah ? Yeah , I just have to check the dates and clear my schedule and ... Yeah . Alright . Cool . Amazing . Hey . Don't tell me you stole Beth's car again . I don't think I 'd try that one again . I took the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter for you to read . It's uh , grandma's writing . Your name's on it , too . Why don't you read it ? Um , you sure you wan na hear this ? No . To my bony Becca , my beloved girl who bewitched me the moment her eyes flashed at mine . By now you have learned the truth and no doubt you are angry at me , and Beth , and Peter for robbing you the reality of the circumstances of your birth . You are no longer a girl , but a grown person of great mind and heart . I ask you to reach deep inside yourself and ask , what should've been done ? A girl was not ready to be a mother and a woman who's not yet finished being one . It wasn't ideal , but I knew how to keep you whole so you could grow up to have all the strength you needed to understand that your life was filled with true love , not true labels . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my Tony , you might just be old enough to realize how lucky you are to have a sister . I hope you will be closer to her than anyone else because you two need each other . You must both forgive Beth and Peter . For they have been the one's carrying this heavy burden these many years . Only you have the power to lift the weight off their hearts . Set them free , my loves , and you will be free , too . Free to love any chance you get . What's this ? Dear Becca , Tony Irving , your grandmother , Alice Zelda Irving , has left her estate in the sum of $2.3 million dollars to her grandchildren , Rebecca and Tony Irving . Holy crap . Oh , miss gray . How are you today ? Hi , doctor Conrad , I'm ... Well , I see you were referred by your internist , doctor Hamilton . And my notes say here that you're here for a D and C . Dilation and curettage . Termination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But your nurse said you wanted to see me first ? Well , yes . We take the termination of pregnancy very seriously . Right . Well , I can assure you , doctor , that I take everything to do with my body very seriously and I've done extensive research on this subject and , you know , I'm quite prepared for the medical risks and as for the mental complications , it's not like some pubescent teenage girl with raging hormones that's surprised by her condition . You know , and unaware of the choice she's making . For the record , your hormones are , in fact , raging . And your primary physician has noted her that you were indeed surprised to find out you were pregnant . Yes . Right . I mean , I have considered having children , but I've decided against it . You know , I'm um ... I'm a photographer . And I shoot musicians mostly and I have this hectic schedule and I'm supposed to go on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy or motherhood or anything like that . It's a difficult decision for any woman . You know , I mean , really it's so easy for men , right ? I mean , they think that they have forever , but you know , I happen to know that after 40 , men's stuff is damaged , too . There's a proclivity towards schizophrenia and um , an increased risk of suicide or ... Maybe it's the other way around , but you know , it's just ... No one ever tells men , you know , just settle down and wait for the right girl . That's just ... Whatever's in a stone's throw , just grab them and do it . I can schedule you as soon as the new year . See , but I'm going on tour with Quinn after the new year . I'll make some time . Well , enjoy your holiday and after the new year , I'll ... I'll take care of you . Dear nc45729 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so glad to know that you are happy and well . That makes me feel the decision I made was not a mistake . Even if it may not have been the best choice . Of course your need to know your family health history is wholly understandable . I have attached a file that compiles as best a complete family history that I could gather . I am , however , deeply sorry to tell you that I am not able to confirm with absolute certainty your father's identity . I was a very confused young woman and lacking in self-worth . As you have put whatever worry I have had about your life at ease , please allow me to do the same in case you've ever worried about me . I , too , am well , and have found real love and self-worth in my life . I feel that what little sense I did have was knowing what I didn't have to give you then . And now I think , perhaps , knowing you are happy and have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was able to give you life when your mother couldn't and that she was able to shower you with the wisdom for which I could imagine or hope . I send you the same prayer I had 23 years ago . I wish for love and peace to be your everyday companions . Merry Christmas . Your natural mother , nm45729 . Everyone should have a tree on Christmas . Aww ! This is beautiful . Thank you . Let's hope Santa puts something under it . I stopped believing in Santa when he didn't bring back my mom from the hospital . Maybe we should um , give your dad a present . I asked him what he wanted for Christmas and he said all he wanted was his best friend back . Maybe you could just spend some time with your dad . Is he torturing you again ? I just gave her a piece of our tree , dad . Merry Christmas . Thank you . It's beautiful . Let's go . Merry Christmas . Hello , mother . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany's and guess who I ran into buying some guilt diamonds for his wife . I don't know , mom . I can't keep track of all the bed hopping in New York . Who ? Harlon Kinney . Oh , come on . Did you really think I wouldn't find out ? I sat on what ? Like a dozen foundational boards with Harlon . Six months at Wells and Kinney was enough . Yeah , for god's sake . I've actually been waiting to surprise you with something else that I've been working on . I had been listening to his nauseatingly insipid watermelon-breasted wife horseshoe herself into Valentino originals just so I could get you into that entree program . What could possibly be more important ? I'm sorry , mom . I'm not ready to discuss it with you . Waitressing ? We sent you to Dalton , Andover , and Princeton so that you wouldn't have to wait on other people . How can you be so insensitive ? You wouldn't last a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullshit . If an intelligent , talented woman like Carmen had half of your education , she would not be working for me . She would be me . I mean , really . What are you doing ? What ? Is it that , that Tricia girl from prep school ? I mean , ever since you have been back in touch with her , you have been just completely off your path . You mean , your path ? I have never , never seen you so ungrateful . Are you on something ? I'll bet that she is on drugs . You know , she always seemed like a stoner to me . Layla ... What is going on with you ? You know what , if you must know , she called me because she needed a friend . A real friend . And you're right . She is on drugs . She smokes a joint twice a day so that she can keep one morsel of food down since she's been shooting chemo drugs for her leukemia . Are we done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Just , just ... Just wait . I can't . I have to go . If Kevin knew I was discussing , he doesn't know that I'm talking to you . Okay , sweetie . Well how much money do you need this time ? This time ? You know , god , this is why we don't talk . It's because all you wan na do is judge . No , no . I wan na try to help you and your father would want ... You can't tell dad ! Alright . God , why would you even do that ? Okay . I understand . I won't . You know , this is not like the last time . This is not a loan . Okay . This is an investment . I get it . Fine . You will get every cent back and more . You know , you and dad invest in stocks all the time . This is exactly like that . Okay , it's exactly like ... So when do you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment ? I get it . I see what's going on now . What ? What are you talking about ? - God , I am such an idiot . - What ? You're only doing this so that you can get control again . No , sweetheart . I-I-i ... We want you back in our lives . I miss you so much . You can't buy me . Okay , it's a business investment . I get it . I respect it . Kevin and his brother are getting into designer cakes . Oh , really . Cakes ? Kevin and cakes . No , if you're gon na undermine this , forget it . No , no , no , no , no ! Please . You know , I can't do this . I can't do it . I can't do it . Well , it's up to you . No , it's up to you actually . It's up to you . I haven't seen you , my child , for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly right in some kinda predetermined phrases then you're going to hang up on me ? That isn't fair . It is not fair . Whatever I've done . I didn't raise you to be a bully . God , what is your problem ? What is my problem ? Seriously , you ask me that ? Don't you realize , life is short and I love you and I have not seen you for two years . And that's all my fault . No , probably it is my fault . You know ... When you were born and I saw you , I didn't know that I could ever need anything that badly , that I could ever love anything that much . Just ... - My life just stopped . - Mom . I mean , when I held you for the first time , I didn't know if it was for five minutes or five hours or five weeks . I mean , time just stopped . - Mom . - In a good way . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , mom . Yeah . I mean , it was just , you were so perfect and I was so proud of myself for making you . You weren't overbearing . There was just so much ... Pressure ? Attention . And it was just relentless and overwhelming . I just never felt worth it . Oh , sweetie . My ninth birthday , I don't know if you remember that party ... There were sixteen kids and Mr . marquee on the front lawn , two peanut allergies , and I think there was some conjurer ... Right , uh well , when I blew out my candles ... Two red , three blue , four white . Okay , rain man . When I ... When I blew out my candles ... I wished to be good . And I know that my grown up brain now says good enough , but I will never forget that . You know , I wan na be good . And it never came true . But you were . You were over and over for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my miracle and if miracles are good , then you were good . You were good . How much do you need ? 32,000 . Wow , really ? For cakes ? That's ... What are they , designer ingredients ? You know , it's uh ... Storefront , delivery truck , mixers , and ovens . It actually is a very thorough business plan . Yeah , yeah . Um ... And this is really ... This is what you wan na do ? Sure . No . Of course not . I want to go back to college . I want to teach art history . Well , then let's do that then . Let's do that . It's easier said than done . No , I bet you could get enrolled in the fall . It's not about logistics . It's more a question of childcare facilities . Oh my god , really ? Oh , sweetie , that's wonderful ! You're not a touch disappointed . No , why would I be disappointed ? Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Producing a daughter is spectacular . Well we don't know yet if it's a boy or ... It's a girl , it's a girl . - Oh , you know that for a fact . - I do , I would bet a designer cake business on it , yes . Why do you think that ? Seriously . Have you met your grandmother ? Uh , yeah . Is she not the sweetest woman in the universe ? Absolutely , no argument from me . Well , I made her life miserable for years . - Really ? - Yup , yup . - She never told me that . - No . That is actually really funny . I needed to have you to teach me how to be a daughter to my mother . Oh , god . It's definitely going to be a girl , isn't it ? And she is going to torture me , but I guess it's no more than I deserve , right ? It's no more than you deserve . Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mom . Excuse me , is someone sitting here ? Miss gray . Rigby . Of course , Rigby . You mind ? No . Hi , doctor Conrad . What are you doing here ? Eating . Right . Why are patients always so surprised when they see their doctors in the real world ? Eating and grocery shopping . I guess it spoils the illusion . You know , we don't wan na see our super heroes forced to endure the mundane . Mm . I'm really sorry about the diatribe about the man , sperm , woman thing the other day . I kinda rant when I get nervous . Eh , it's fine . How's the pasta ? It's really good . - Hi . - Oh , hi . What can I get you ? Hm , a glass of Chianti and uh , seafood marinara . Thanks . Rigby , such a cool name . It's my mom's maiden name . Her dad never had any boys so you know the story . Hm . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . Um , I thought I wasn't supposed to . Oh , I thought you were going to um ... No , I am , yes . I am still , I just ... I just thought maybe I shouldn't . Probably a good idea . Can I ask you a personal question ? Hm . Does your wife ever mind you working so closely with other women ? I look at the body clinically for a living . I mean , lips can be used for talking as well as kissing . The hands for working as well as touching . The female organs for giving birth as well as conceiving . I mean , the whole body can be sexual . It's all about the context . I don't think I 'd be too happy if my husband did what you do for a job . Hm . I didn't realize you were married . - No , I'm not . - Yeah ? I'm just saying , if I were . Oh . Did you deliver your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do that . If my husband were my doctor , I 'd have to keep some mystery . I'm that way . I'm this way . It was nice seeing you . You , too . Bye . Bye . Hey , you okay ? Can you bring her a water ? And I think , she's done . Okay ? She's pretty gone . You alright ? Let's get you some fresh air . No cameras . Can't you see she's drunk , asshole ? Get off of her . What the hell are you doing ? What the hell are you doing ? - Get the hell off my bus . - Yeah . Come on . Hold on . Hold on , sweetie . Nelson . Nelson . Hi . Hi , mom . Wow , look at you . You look good , mom . Mm , it's different , huh ? Yeah . They don't let you get too fixed up here . They say it's like another way to mask your feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought you 'd given up on me . Third time's a charm though . I think . I hope . You okay ? I'm sorry I haven't been to see you , but there is a new album and I just finished the tour . That's really great , honey . Wow . Everything sounds like it's going real good for you . I should've called sooner . No , you're calling now . Mom , I didn't just call to say hi . Things got a little out of control on tour . I got a little out of control . I almost did something really bad . I'm coming to get help . I figured if my mom could do it , I can , too . And after , I was wondering if you 'd come and stay with me for a while . You know ? Help me get some things straight . I'm so sorry . I'm so ashamed . Did I do this to you ? It's okay , mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left us , we're still here . You and me . Good morning , miss gray . I'm going to be giving you some twilight sedation for the procedure . Okay , what's that mean ? It means you won't feel any pain , but you'll be slightly aware of the room and what's going on . Just kind of like you're in a groggy state . May I just speak to doctor Conrad for a minute ? Well , the doctor's on a very tight schedule this morning so why don't you let me go ahead and get the iv started . And doctor will come in and talk to you while we prep you , okay ? Look , ma'am ... I'm about to potentially end a life here and certainly change my own , so forgive me if I'm not overly concerned with the schedule of you or the doctor . I need to speak with him before anybody touches me . Rigby , everything okay ? Yeah . No . I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this instant , in my life when everything is under the best of circumstances and I am young and healthy and I have a roof over my head . Sometimes I'll take a vitamin and I'll choke . Or I'll get food poisoning and I'll be up all night vomiting and I'll faint on the bathroom floor and I'll think what if there wasn't anyone . What if no one's there ? You know , kinda scary . I'm scared . And then I think how much worse it'll be when I'm not as young and not as healthy . And then I think , is that a reason to have a kid just so they'll be there to pick you up when you fall , just because you were there for them . I mean , look at me , I am not there for my mother because I am too much of a coward to look in her face and see that she doesn't know who I am so I pay someone to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my perfect , gorgeous , angel of a mother lose her mind . I mean , god , I am not fit to take care of anyone . Parent or child . But , I mean , I mean people have been doing this since the dawn of man , right ? They don't stop and contemplate all the what if's because if they did there wouldn't be anyone here . I wan na keep the baby . We can do that . Yeah , definitely , we can do that . Aren't they just gorgeous ? They're amazing . Why can't you just tell your mom ? She could like totally help you . It's just that if she helps me , I might never know what part is me and what part is her and if I'm gon na do this , then I need to know what I'm really capable of , you know ? Like really capable of as in alone . No , this is a disaster ! If you're gon na do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Sure . - Okay . Okay , get me half a dozen Gotham Ganache and twelve Harlem truffles . You heard the boss , boys . Step up the pace . Let's do this . What happened ? I thought you didn't wan na meet . Um , no , she sent me an email saying she wanted to meet as soon as possible . When ? Right now . I'm on my way to meet her at the duck pond . She said that she would have something red with her , an umbrella or something . Oh my god . I think I see something red . Oh , I'm so nervous , I think I'm gon na get sick . No , you're not gon na throw up , alright ? Look , take three deep , long breaths . Remember this isn't the first time you're seeing her . You're the first person she ever met . I love you . I love you , too . Look , I'm happy for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m gon na be somebody's stepfather . Okay , bye . Miss Scott ? Hi ! It's Layla . Layla Chapman . From the pig and the cow building . We met on facetime . You were speaking to my mother , Nina Chapman . Miss Scott , are you okay ? I'm so sorry . It's just that I'm supposed to be meeting someone here , is there someone I can call for you ? March 15 , 1991 . You were born at 3:22 pm , march 15 , 1991 . It was a rainy day , you were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen . You ? - Is it okay ? - Yeah . Today is mother's day and it's a perfect spring day . And the air smells like you're perfume . I'm having a baby , mom , and I can't stop thinking about you . I almost didn't wan na have her because I couldn't bear to love somebody as much as you and risk my heart . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating their stories , I forgot create my own . Mom ? In here , Layla . Hi . Hey . Here . What are you doing ? Well , I'm working . You know , we've got that couture gala coming up and I need you to help me pick a frock . What are you talking about ? I thought that was decided by a committee months ago . Aren't you wearing Zac Posen ? I am , that's why I never eat , but I was wondering what you're gon na wear . Really ? Well , how come you never let me go ? Yes , well , since then I've been privied to some new information . That makes me think that it might be a good idea . Why didn't you tell me that this was what you were working on , hm ? Waitress ? Yeah , but Georgina helped me streamline them a little . I can't believe Trisha sent them to you . Yeah , well she knew you wouldn't . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were working on ? I happen to be pretty good at launching hot , new designers . Really ? I don't know . I thought what if you hated them ? What if you thought that I sucked at this ? I wanted to earn your praise , not be entitled to it . Well ... Hm ... This is the one . It's sleek . It's architectural . It's classic . It's you . I like this one , too . I , um ... I can't tell if I get it from her or from you . So ... Why didn't you just tell me you wanted to meet her ? I didn't think I did . When Trisha got sick , it made me wan na know more about my medical history , so I sent a letter . And then when Trisha died , I thought what if that were me . Oh , honey , it's not ... No , mom , I mean it . I thought what if I go my entire life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , I can't describe it , but you have no idea what it's like to not know a single person who has your hands or your eyes or your crooked teeth . I just ... I just wanted to see her . Are you mad ? No . It's ... It's as natural as breathing . Honey , everybody wants to know where they come from . You know , I'm always so amused that I have that same crinkle here in my nose like grandma . And then I sit in the car with my purse on my lap just the same way . She lives in my building and she's working with you . I mean , that's a weird coincidence . Oh , it's not a coincidence . I think it's a mother's instinct to search for her child . I am sure that someway she was looking for you her whole life . Thanks , mom . And anyway , I'm just ... I'm just so dang impressed . I'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! More than , well ... Just more and more . I love you , too . - Surprise ! - Surprise ! We know it's mother's day , but can I still call you Beth ? Oh my god . You did all this ? Well , I had help . So much for soccer practice . And you ! Aw ! Mm ! Alright , who wants champagne ? - I do . - I do . Can I have some ? - No ! - No ! Come on , you guys . Here , help me . Come on . I missed you so much . I missed you , too . And I'm sorry it's been so long , I just ... You needed time . I did . I really did . You know , I'm just ... I'm just lucky to have you . No more secrets . No ! No more secrets . Alright , toast time . For you . For you . No , you get the little one . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other name , just as sweet . Thank you . - Cheers . - Cheers . Hey . How you doing ? You okay ? Mhm , yeah . I'm good . I'm okay . I can do this , doctor Conrad . Call me Andrew . You're gon na do great , Rigby . But I got ta tell you something . Hm . I can't be your doctor today . What are you talking about ? Now ? Now . Why do doctors keep doing this to me ? Listen , just listen to me , Rigby . I'm not married . I've never been married . I don't have any kids . I use the ring to keep a professional distance from my patients , but with you , it didn't work . I don't know if you have any feelings for me , but if there's even the slightest chance . I can't go into that delivery room with you . - Really ? - Yeah . I think I have to be the keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go great . Hi , Rigby . I'm doctor Barnard . I'll be bringing your girl into the world today . Going to see grandma . You ready ? Lydia . Meet Lydia . I'll take her out . It's okay , baby . It's okay . I just ... I need to tell you I'm sorry . Mom . I love you . I love you . Mom . I had my daughter , mom . She's just starting to look like something that might turn into a person . I was so scared . But now looking back on all the lives and stories of others , I know it will be alright . Some people can't see the love they have until they see it through someone else's eyes . Some people have no mother . And others have more than one . Others don't see that mothers come in all shapes and sizes . Sometimes there for just a moment . And sometimes they remain for a lifetime . Her name is your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come to life again . Every time I call to her . Lydia . I hope your last thought before you slipped into the darkness of your mind was that I would remember everything about you . Everything . ? I would never let a tear fall from your eyes ? ? no , no , no , no ? ? ' cause everything you are to me ? ? ooh , I could never let you hurt inside ? ? you mean so much and I'm so thankful that you're in my life ? ? and I appreciate your love and all your sacrifice ? ? without you by my side , I never could survive ? ? I wouldn't be the woman standing here before your eyes ? ? you've taught me strength and you gave me guidance ? ? whenever faith was lost , you were there to find it ? ? and all because a mother's love is unconditional ? ? with all my heart and all my soul I wan na let you know ? ? that I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I love you ? ? and I will never place anyone above you ? ? said I thank you , I thank you ? ? and I love you , I love you ? ? and I will never , ever place no one above you ? ? you have given me life ? ? and I just want you to know ? ? that you're the reason I'm here today ? ? I will never let go to everything that we share ? ? and nothing can compare ? ? I thank you , I thank you , I thank you ? ? here's what I'm sayin ' ? ? see , I've been blessed to be raised by a woman so strong ? ? cause even when I did things wrong ? ? you would show me just the way that I should carry on ? ? you kept me safe , and you protected me with all you had ? ? and any time I was in need you gave your very last ?

Like , ping pong , table tennis ? You know , the game ? Oh , you actually mean , like , ping pong . Okay , so here's Cole . Isn't he cute ? I guess . And here's Ella . ( gags ) I do not like her at all . So I wanted Sophie's help with this but she , as you can see , ( laughs ) is gone . So I turn to you , okay ? See this guy over here ? His name is John Dixon but we call him Dix because he literally is , you know , with that . Right . So if I can get him to kiss me in front of Cole , maybe I can make Cole jealous and have him want to play ping pong with me . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll take that as a yes .

That Dix guy is a dick . Right ? Don't worry , my friends pushed him into the pool too and he tried to dunk me , but I was on the swim team , so ... It was good because I had beer all over my shirt , so I totally rinsed it out and Cole came out to watch . I guess as long as Cole was there . Isn't it like 4:30 your time ? Yeah , but I'm up , so whatever . You're a night owl . Don't you have a curfew ? ( yawns ) 11:30 . But my dad goes to bed at , like , 10 , so . He doesn't check up on you ? No . He trusts me . I'm totally trustworthy . Yeah , I can see that . T , it's a party . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosen up if you want friends . I have friends . I have , like , tons of friends . I'm just saying , it doesn't seem like you go out that much . No , my friends and I go out all the time , they just couldn't tonight . Okay . Besides , you know , sometimes I like having a night to myself every once in a while . Sometimes it's nice to just decompress , do some gaming , listen to some music . ( @calm music ) Yeah , no , I get it . I just ... Wait , I think I hear my dad . Bye . My dad took my phone . What , why ? I'm grounded for two weeks . He found out that I missed curfew . How ? He came in here , like , at midnight and I guess I wasn't in here , obviously . WTF , this is my room . That's a total invasion of privacy . I don't want him in here touching my stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he goes to bed at , like , 10 . Yeah , usually . But lately he's all freaked out because he's retiring in a few weeks . He just roams the halls drinking nightcaps . What's he freaked out for though ? ' Cause isn't that good news ? You 'd think . But he , like , doesn't know what to do with himself now , so . What about your mom ? My mom died seven years ago , so she's not much help . Oh my god , I'm so sorry . I didn't know . Whatever . I'm over it , but my dad needs to find a new hobby because this is getting ridiculous . Sugar free . [Teel] Wait , if you're grounded , then how are you talking to me ? Oh , he didn't take my computer . He thinks I'm doing homework on it , which is you . So I guess I'll be doing you every day after school . Whoa . Mind out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who said it . Girls are allowed to have their mind in the gutter . It's sexy . When guys do it , it's just , it's gross . I wasn't aware of that rule . Stick with me . You'll learn . [Teel's_Mom] Hey , sweetie ? Hon , you've been up here quite a while . You been playing video games ? What ? No , I'm talking to my friend [Madison] . [Teel's_Mom] Hon , please don't . What ? I'm telling the truth ! You know what Dr . Thomas said about you making things up . Hi , Mrs . Johnson ! Oh my , I'm sorry I didn't realize . [Madison] Daniels , do you remember me ? I used to live down the street from you . [Madison] , what a surprise . [Madison] Daniels , of course I remember . You didn't tell me you were talking to [Madison] Daniels . Yeah , actually , Mom , I did . Well , that's great , that is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again . You too , Mrs . Johnson . [Madison] Daniels , huh . See ? My parents suck . She seems nice . You have no idea . You might think that your parents suck , but that is just a teenage syndrome that distorts your perception , when in actual scientifical fact , they are perfectly legit . Who says I'm being scientific about it ? No , I'm just saying , I need more proof before I accept your assertion . What are you , a lawyer ? I'm gon na be . So pony up . Okay . My parents , every year , make me try out for sports , even though I don't have any talent or inclination or even the slightest interest in the jock arts . Eh , wrong answer . They're just trying to make sure that you're well-rounded . Which is actually the distinctive trait of a loving parent . Last year , I auditioned , or tried out for the track team and I deliberately ran as slow as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Totally reasonable . Right , but then my mom read the school guidelines and she discovered that technically the coach isn't allowed to cut anybody from the team . It's a little known secret . So she forced him to let me run . It was like a whole to-do at my school and then finally we came up with this shoddy compromise that kept me on the team as the mascot . What's the mascot ? Oh no ! Yeah . So now I'm at all the track meets , which no one even goes to in the first place , and I'm stuck wearing this ratty old costume that hasn't seen the light of day since like 1992 . I think they just wanted me to kind of get involved and make friends , but it really just made me a target for the coach's kid who kept kicking me in the shins . Okay , although misguided , it came out of concern for your well-being . They tried to get me to go out for football this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle to get out of that . Yes , okay , all dads want their kids to play sports . That's like a primal instinct from our hunter-gatherer days . It's not my dad , it's my mom . Unexpected . Yeah , it's like she's on this mission to keep me from becoming ... A dweeb ? Thanks . You'll survive . It gets worse . Always . You remember how I said I wanted to audition for Bye Bye Birdie ? [Madison] You did ? Yeah , I told you that the first night we talked . Yeah , yeah . Bye Bye , yeah . Right . Well , I had to miss the auditions because my mom decided we should take a spontaneous trip to visit my grandma . Thank you , Mom . Family's important . Yeah , but grandma didn't even want us to come . So not only did she force us on grandma , probably just to ruin the long weekend that she had planned with her man that she's been seeing who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants her for her money , but that we should butt out of because it's grandma's only source of happiness right now . But she also deliberately ruined any chance that I had of being in the show . I don't know , the jury's still out on this one . And she took grandma's car away from her because she's not allowed to drive anymore , so now it's just sitting in our garage instead of hers . ( laughs ) And you're complaining about what ? She just scored you a car ! Mad , I can't even drive it . She won't let me get my license . "" My mom won't let me get my license . "" No wonder you're grounded , you're mean . Nuh uh . And manipulative . [Madison] What ? That poor Dix guy didn't know what he had coming . [Madison] Uh , wow . Where's all this animosity coming from ? I don't know , I'm just calling it as I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any friends ? What ? No . [Madison] ' Cause it's nothing to be ashamed of . I'm not ashamed of it . So you admit it ! No , I don't ... You are a devil woman . ( @calm music ) What ? I'm gon na help you . I don't need help . [Madison] Fine , not help . Coaching . No , I don't want to be your project . Okay , okay . I'll be your friend . What is this , second grade , Mad ? And as your friend , I'm gon na help you get more friends . I can not believe we're having this conversation . Okay , who's your best friend ? I'm not answering that question . Do you have a best friend ? Who are your friends ? Come on , [Teel] , just give me some names . Do you have any friends ? No ! You don't have any friends ? No . Not even people at school that you casually talk to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm running late so nobody realizes I don't have anybody to talk to . Wow . That's really sad . Yeah . Well , that's kind of why I wanted to try out for Bye Bye Birdie , because I thought I could at least fit in with the theater geeks . What about Facebook ? What about Facebook ? Do you have any friends on Facebook ? Are you not on Facebook ? [Teel] You mean Fakebook ? Okay , not everyone on Facebook is fake . It's like , it's like Clark Kent . How is it like Clark Kent ? Clark Kent has a secret identity and a public identity . You need your public identity . I just , I don't like where this is headed . Okay , by the end of the year , you're gon na have 150 Facebook friends . That is a promise . Come on , it'll be easy ! I think I'm gon na hurl . You don't even have to talk to anyone face to face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need a Facebook profile page . ( fakesthrowingup ) Okay , [Madison] , that is a great idea . Thank you so much , yeah . Yes , [Madison] , that is a great idea . What is the worst that can happen ? I could find out nobody likes me . How is that any different from right now ? Shut up . [Madison] No , you shut up . Talk to the hand . So Sophie just told me that fricking Ella Wilson is moving in on Cole . So while I'm stuck here grounded , she's flirting her ass off with him . And I do mean her ass right off . She's super slutty but it doesn't help that she's kinda hot in like a trashy sort of way . I mean , I can still flirt with him in Earth Science and Math but she's in those classes too ! I do get Ella-free lunches though , Tuesday and Thursday , because she goes to talk time with my dad . Still . Wait , with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he's trying this whole "" You can talk to me , "" I'm one of you "" thing . But really it's a bunch of desperate girls clamoring for attention , it's disgusting . I've forbidden Sophie from going . Hey , Mad ? [Madison] What ? I made a Facebook page . ( screams ) No you didn't ! Let me see . ( gasps ) Oh ! Oh , you're a handsome devil . [Teel] Very funny . No , I'm serious , you're really cute in , like , a Rhett and Link sort of way . Yeah , well , there it is . Another reminder that I have zero friends . Uh-uh . Not after you accept my friend request . I don't know if I should accept requests from just anybody . [Madison] Har har . Fine . Accepted . What do you think of my new profile pic ? Where's the rest of your skirt ? Hey , if you got it , flaunt it . Hey , Facebook friends ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Sophie to add you too , so that'll make it nine . They said it couldn't be done . Wait . What ? None of these friends go to your school ! I thought we went over that . I don't have any friends at school , so why would I friend them online ? Who's Parthoran ? ( laughs ) Is that his real name ? He's just a guy I met at the Akron Fanboy Expo . [Madison] You talked to someone you didn't know ? It's way easier when you're wearing a costume . [Madison] Well , what's his name ? He goes by Parthoran . [Madison] Where does he live ? British Colombia . [Teel] , don't you want friends from your own school ? Yeah , but you have to have at least some small reason to friend them , right ? No . People are friend whores . I just don't know if I want to be that . Will you just join this century ? Seriously . What about other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lost touch ? Maybe . Such as ? [Teel] ! [Sonny] . [Sonny] Denbrowski . [Sonny] , there you go . But he's like a jock boy tool now . Beggars can't be choosers . Cole joined choir ! Can you believe it ? Sophie and I have been working on him for weeks and he finally caved . I think we're gon na survive the Ella Wilson attacks . She only has two classes with him now and now I have four , including Health and next week we're doing the unit on human sexuality , so I can say a whole bunch of accidentally dirty comments and get him in the right frame of mind . Gross . Oh , and I have Sophie running interference for me while I'm grounded . So her instructions are to interrupt all conversations between Ella and Cole and to never , ever let them touch . Which is gon na be quite a project because Ella is super grabby . Wait , when did you go to the beach ? I thought you were grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that I'm grounded . These are old , from the summer . Don't I look hot ? If you mean sweaty , then yeah . That's my beach glow . I'm not a slut . [Teel] I didn't say that . [Madison] Then why are you criticizing my pictures ? I'm not criticizing them . First my skirt is too short and now you think that I'm some sweaty whore ? You don't look like a ... Look , I can post whatever I want . I don't need your opinion . You asked me ! Yeah , learn to spot when a girl wants a compliment . Okay , I'm sorry . I didn't mean it , I was just like ... You look hot . You look totally hot . You don't mean that . Yeah , I do . I just felt weird saying it to you because ... I don't know . What's wrong ? Nothing . [Teel] Are you sure ? I have to go . Wait , Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Madison] . Are you feeling better ? Yes , did you friend him ? Yeah . Are we gon na talk about yesterday or ? Live in the now . What happened ? He accepted my request . ( gasps ) Your first Facebook friend at school . Yeah , it's all very good but it's not like it means anything . [Madison] Why not ? Because he just sits there on a list . So ? Then look at his feed . Learn something about him . Maybe you can start a conversation that way . Maybe . And you got ta post stuff too , okay ? You're in the game now . No , Mad , I hate all that stuff ! It's all like "" Oh , I'm playing my Xbox . "" Look at me play fast . "" Look at me play slow . "" Look at me play boring . "" Okay , then we'll post something interesting and somebody might be interested . I doubt it . T , sometimes it's just for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . It's nothing . We just had this biology test today and he sits right behind me in class . So I was like "" You ready for the test ? "" And he was like "" Not even close . "" And then we took the test . Oh , okay , yeah . Awesome . Yay . No girls . What do you mean no girls ? I mean , no , I don't have my eye on any girls right now . Not even your peripheral vision ? Look , I'm sorry ... The connection ... Failure ... [Teel] , come on ! You're telling me there's not a single pretty girl at your school that you think about more than the others ? There are lots of pretty girls at my school , Mad , but most of them are stuck up bitches so I'm not really interested . [Madison] But you're such a flirt ! I am not a flirt . Yes , you are ! You flirt with me every single time we talk . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other girl ? I think you think I live in a very different world than I think I live in . I think you think I think that . [Teel] Shut up . I'm just saying ! "" I'm just saying . "" Oh . Oh , I see . What ? No , it's cool . I get it . What ? Nothing , I just ... No need to say another word . ( laughs ) What are you talking about ? I see who you're saving the good stuff for . What ? What good stuff ? Seriously , what ? Screen tells me all I need to know . He accused me of cheating . Not like I was cheating off of someone else because he knows I got like the best grade in the class , but apparently the second half of [Sonny]'s scantron was , like , identical to mine . So now Mr . Hanson thinks I was just holding up my test so [Sonny] could look over my shoulder . But why would I help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only friended because you made me . He just sat there the whole time with this , like , tight shirt on and all the girls in the hallway were creaming their pants . T , I'm very sorry , but I've got a situation here . Bigger than a cheating scandal ? Yeah , actually . Two words . Retardedment party . Offensive much ? Just because he's retiring , the school board and the booster club want to throw my dad a party . Well , that's according to him . So my dad thought "" Oh , I can't use "" the school board's resources for nonessential purposes . "" Why doesn't my daughter throw the party ? "" So now I'm stuck planning the party that the school board wants to throw for my dad and I have to do all this crap like invitations , decorations , food , invitations . You said invitations twice . Not to mention the doppelganger cake . Clarification please ? That's the exact replica of Mrs . Spiceman's cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpalatable and probably give everyone the runs if it's anything like last year's . ( laughs ) T , don't laugh ! My dad's actually making me do this ! Can't you just ask her not to bake one ? No , she's like the school board's biggest donor or something . Truth comes out . And now he's gon na be home all the time and I'm gon na have to wife it up for him even more than I already do . That man can't , like , do anything for himself . I'm gon na have to make his food and change his diaper and god knows what else now that he doesn't have an administrative assistant . You're trying to win . [Madison] What ? Yeah , you're trying to win the sucky parent contest . Whatever . You love planning parties . Even mentally challenged parties for your dad . I bet you're telling all your friends about this and relishing every minute of extra attention that you get for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And also , by the way , if you enjoy the suffering caused by your parents , then that negates the suckage and instantly disqualifies you from the contest . Okay , first of all , there is no contest . And even if there was , trust me , I would win . ( @doorbell_rings ) Who's here ? It's [Sonny] . Wait , [Sonny] ? The [Sonny] ? Yeah . The hell is he doing here ? I don't know . What are you waiting for ? Go ! T , go ! Okay , okay . [Madison] T ! What , what ? Take me with you ! Okay , I'm bringing ... What do I say to him ? Jesus , T , it's like your first day as a human ! Well , I don't know what he wants . He's the same guy you hung out with before . No , he's not , not even close . Let me see ! He's just standing there . Wait , T , I lost the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open the door ! Okay . Hey . [Sonny] , what's up ? Hey . Oh , he is scrumptious . [Sonny] My mom said I should apologize to you for cheating off you in class today . T , I can't see . What ? [Teel] I can't see why you 'd feel like you 'd have to . It's totally cool , I understand . Thanks for stopping by . What are you doing ? What is that ? [Teel] Oh , it's nothing , I was just on the phone with my friend and ... Hey , [Sonny] , I thought that was you . Come in , come in , come in for a few minutes . I could scoop you and Terrance some ice cream . Like old times . [Sonny] Sure , that sounds great . Wait . Who's Terrance ? ( laughs ) Well , hello there , Terrance . [Teel] Ha , very funny . Why didn't you call me ? I wanted to know what happened ! [Teel] I don't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like six times . [Teel] I noticed . Well , I saw those mean posts on your Facebook . I wanted to know what's going on . Why is your camera not on ? [Teel] Must be broken . Okay , that is the stupidest lie I've ever heard . [Teel] Seriously , it must be like a bug or something . Whatever , turn it on . [Teel] Can we just talk like this today ? No , why ? [Teel] To keep up the mystery . Shut up and turn it on . [Teel] I can't . Are you naked or something ? [Teel] No . Then turn it on ! Or I'm hanging up . [Teel] Wait , wait , please don't hang up . T . Okay , seriously , I got my life back today . I am officially ungrounded and I may never talk to you again so this might be your last chance . [Teel] ( sighs ) Okay . Oh my god . T , what happened ? Nothing , I just fell . On your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some sports ? Yeah . [Madison] T , did you get in a fight ? No . [Madison] What else would make your face look like that ? A fight implies that I was an active participant . [Madison] You got beat up ? By who ? Just a bunch of ass cavities . [Madison] At your school ? Yeah . Did you tell someone ? [Teel] No . What did you tell your parents ? Could we talk about something else , please ? No , your face literally looks like a hamburger . Mad , can we please talk about something else ? Okay . Terrance . And not that either . I don't like it . Come on , Terrance , I need to know your origin story . Please ? I'm gon na keep calling you Terrance . You're so annoying . That's not very nice , Terrance . Fine . My dad started calling me [Teel] when I was a little kid because I would always run around the house wearing , like , a cape yelling "" I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Ss yet . Oh ! Yeah , so now my mom is the only one who calls me Terrance and I hate it . My name is [Teel] and that's what you should call me . I can't call you T anymore ? T is fine . Okay , so I need to hurry because Cole's performing at the school talent show tonight and my dad's giving , like , his last speech as principal or whatever . He's all freaked out . He just walked in on me while I was showering . He couldn't wait 10 minutes to borrow my shaving cream ? I was all like "" Dad , get out ! "" And he's all like "" Nothing I've never seen before . "" Whatever . I don't even care though because tonight I'm a free woman . I am ungrounded ! Mad , I think you wear too much makeup . That's not insulting . No , no , don't freak out , please . I just think you look better without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup on ! [Teel] Actually , I have . It was the accidental pool party ? That night ? Okay , so ? So I just think when you put on all that makeup , it hides everything that's beautiful about your face . T , I have to wear some . No , no , I know . I just think you should wear less . So we see more of you . T , you can't do this to me right now ! Cole's gon na be there ! I know , I know , that's why I'm telling you . I was already freaking out about seeing him . And now you drop this on me ? I know . Just let me help you . What do you mean ? Let me help you put on your makeup . No ! [Teel] Just try it for one day and if you don't like it , then you can go back to your old way . What do you know about makeup ? My mom's a hairdresser who also does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was literally a little kid . I can do this . Fine . Fine ? Fine ! Okay , good . Now just look right into the camera and I'll tell you what to do . No , like right into the camera . Okay ! Good . T ! Okay , okay . Start with powder . Powder ? I don't have any foundation on . [Teel] You don't need it . Yes , I do . I am way too pale . No , you don't , your skin is like flawless , it's the best feature of your face . Plus , it's a good thing to be pale . How ? You ever heard of Snow White ? You are such a nerd ! Trust me , less is more . Good . Now eyes . Just a little shadow . That's good , that's good . Now mascara . No , uh-uh . I need eyeliner . I have bug eyes . Fine , fine , but it has to be the lightest brown you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be razor thin , so we don't even know we're seeing it . Good . Good . And mascara ? [Teel] Unless you want to skip it . No . ( laughs ) Okay , that's plenty . What color blush do you have ? I use this one . No , that's way too orange for you . You want your cheeks to look like apples . What about the red one ? This one ? [Teel] Yeah . So I can look like a whore ? ( laughs ) You won't look like a whore , just don't put so much on . You just brush it on really lightly , yeah . ( whines ) Good . Now lips . Not your usual red . We're going regular lip gloss . You are killing me . Something shiny but without color . Your lips are already perfect . Yeah , that's great . Now let me just look at you for a second . ( laughs ) Don't look at me like that , you're making me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror for the whole day and just notice how people react to you . Okay . You look beautiful . Shut up . T ! Forward to tonight's performances . As many of you know ... [Madison] It's my dad . I'll be retiring in a few weeks . [Madison] Droning on . [Madison's_Father] You're thrilled , I know . I've spent time getting to know each and every one of you . [Madison] It's Cole . [Madison's_Father] That means you , Chad Mendez . I've always told you ( mumbles ) ... ? I'm basking in sunshine on a rainy Wednesday night ? Nothing's impossible when you're here ? I take a look out the window and you'll see ? How long is it gon na rain ? ? I just smile Oh my god . Okay , okay , okay . I'm gon na do it . There she goes . Cole ? You were , like , amazing . Thanks . These are for you . You were amazing . I just sang what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , totally . Wow , flowers . Yeah . Well , you look , you know , like . Thank you . Hey , you know , it sucks that your dad's retiring because he's like , he's the best . Oh , no , that's ' cause he's not your dad . But you know . You still grounded and stuff ? No . Well , my parents aren't home tonight and I wanted to know if you wanted to come over . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , I could make time , yeah . Cool , I'll text you . Okay . Okay . Bye . ( laughs ) T ! You are a genius ! Oh , easy now . Okay , Mr . Fashion Consultant . You have to help me choose what to wear to Cole's for the big night . You really think tonight's the big night ? Duh . Didn't you hear that song ? It was totally about me . We could do this shirt with jeans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T , help ! What about the dress ? The dress ? The dress ? What am I , like 30 ? At least try it on for me ? Okay . Whoa , wait , whoa . What are you doing ? A little shy , Mr . T ? No . T , okay , when you have a girlfriend and you're gon na want to have sex with her , you're gon na have to see her naked . Okay , well , for now can you please just go off screen or something ? Okay . But you don't know what you're missing ! ( blows ) Wear that . Really ? Yes , really . It's ridiculously gorgeous , wear it . I'm sorry , T , I'm gon na have to use my veto power here . This shows more skin . T , I can't believe this is happening . Please be careful , Mad . Okay , Dad . Who else is here ? I hear music . ( knocks ) Mad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been worse . ( laughs ) It was worse . Oh yeah . Oh yeah , I forgot , Cole and Sophie , they had sex . With Sophie Sophie ? Are you effing kidding me ? How convenient , right ? Apparently after they dropped me off , they went back to his house and had sex . Big fat betrayal sex . [Teel] How do you know ? Oh , it's all over Facebook . And when I tried to talk to her about it , she full on lies to my face . You know , Mad , I think it's for the best . How ? Because you don't want your first time to be some hookup at a party . It was not a hookup ! It was Cole . And besides , it was not my , no . What ? It wasn't what ? Your first time ? [Madison] , are you keeping secrets ? [Madison] ! ( laughs ) Oh . How could you not tell me that ? Who did you have sex with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this ! I keep trying and I keep messing it up ! I'm sure they're fine . No , they're not , they're not fine ! They're not fine , they have to be perfect ! My dad is gon na see them and they have to be perfect . [Teel] He's not gon na mind . No , it has to be perfect ! I'm starting over . Hey , look , Mads . Stop . Let me see . Let me see . What ? It has a smudge right there ! It looks great . No , they don't . Mad , Cole's an idiot . I can't imagine what he was thinking . You're so much prettier than Sophie . I'm not pretty . You're right , you're not pretty , you're beautiful . Shut up . I mean it . You're intelligent and beautiful ... You're an intelligent and beautiful girl . Woman . Woman , even , Mad . You're an intelligent and beautiful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And beautiful . You said that three times . It was four . By the way , I have 37 Facebook friends . [Madison] That's great . I have an audition this week . You didn't tell me that . It's not really a big deal . [Madison] No spontaneous trips to grandma's house ? I found a way around that . [Madison] How ? I'm not going to tell my mom . What's the part ? Romeo . That's a big part . Sure you can handle that ? Well , you know , I memorized the speech but I don't really know what else to do . You show me . No . Oh yeah . After my whole ordeal with Cole , you don't think I deserve some entertainment ? Come on . Fine . You and your ways . Okay , but for tonight's performance of Romeo and Juliet , the role of Juliet will be played by the lovely and talented Miss [Madison] Daniels . Okay . Oh , and I figure the scene is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big romantic , he's just horny and wants to see Juliet's boobs . Wow . Okay . Here goes . ( gasps ) But soft ! What light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east and Juliet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she ! Be not her maid , since she is envious ! Her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it . Cast it off ! It is my lady . ( sighs ) It is my love ! ( laughs ) See how she leans her cheek upon her hand . Oh , but I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek . That's it . So did it suck that bad ? No . That didn't suck . That didn't suck at all . ( rings ) It's late . Why are you calling me ? Were you asleep ? Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wake up , because I have something to show you . I'm up , I just can't promise I'll stay up . [Madison] I think I can keep you up . We'll see . We will see . So , what ? T , don't rush me . Mad , I'm really tired . I want to go back to bed . You wish . You're being weird . Good night . No , T , wait , wait ! T , give me a sec . I'm just gon na put my head down right here . So I've been thinking . I've been thinking a lot about what you said . Whatever it was , it sure was brilliant . How I shouldn't try to have sex with idiots , especially Cole . It's good to be idiot-free . I agree . I was also thinking about you . I'm flattered . I was thinking about you a lot . And how you're not an idiot . So ... This ... Is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? Seriously , Mad . Just enjoy it . Do you like it ? Uh ... I'll take that as a yes . [Madison] , don't . Don't be a prude . Mad , Mad , stop , seriously . This is not , I'm not watching this ! I'm not watching . Why not ? [Teel] Because it's weird and desperate . Weird and desperate ? Yeah . You're an ass ! What ? I'm trying to give you something ! My own personal internet porn ? Is that what this is ? Well , Mad , that's what it feels like . So I disgust you . No , no , you don't disgust me . Then what ? We're friends and you wan na stay friends ? Well , yeah . Fuck you . Wait . What ? ( dings ) ( dings ) ( rings ) What ? I'm sorry . Okay . I'll hold onto that while I cry myself to sleep . I mean it . I didn't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm serious . I figured you 'd be out chasing all the gorgeous popular guys . T , you're gorgeous . No , I'm not . T , yes , you are . And you're sweet . And you actually listen to what I say . What did you expect ? I don't know . [Madison] First you internet stalk me , then you have all these deep conversations with me , then you're all like "" You're beautiful and intelligent "" and Cole's an idiot . "" He is an idiot . Yeah , well , you are too . Yeah , I guess I am . Then why do I feel like the idiot ? Look , Mad , I've been driving around all night trying to decide whether to tell you this . Wait , driving ? My mom's afraid to practice with me , so sometimes when I can't sleep , I take my grandma's car around the neighborhood . Rebel . I don't really like girls . I'm hanging up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it . You don't get it . I don't really like any girls that way . Because ... Oh , crap . I like boys . What ? Yeah . I think I might be , you know . That's convenient . Mad , I mean it . You're the first person I've ever told . Wait , really ? Really . I've been wanting to tell you for like a really long time but I didn't know when or how to bring it up . Well , this was perfect timing . I'm sorry . Are you ... Are you sure ? I'm not really sure about anything . Then how do you know ? Well , I mean , there aren't really girls that I think about more than any others except for you . But then I just think about , you know , what we're going to talk about next time we see each other . Not other stuff . Do you think about other stuff with boys ? Yeah , kind of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Sonny] . Wait , him ? Yeah . Him . A lot . I can see why . Me and him used to be such good friends when we were kids . But then we both changed so much and he became really good at sports and I became really good at watching him play sports . ( laughs ) T . Is this why they beat you up ? Yeah . Well , yes and no . [Madison] What do you mean ? Well , it was because of [Sonny] . Wait , he beat you up ? No , no , no , no , it was his friends . [Madison] He didn't . Well ... You remember when he came over to my house after I helped him cheat ? You said you didn't . [Teel] Yeah , that's what I said . Okay . Well , ice cream with my mom was perfectly awkward . But then we started talking about this card game that we used to play when we were kids , Magic ? And it turned out that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , years ago . And so I told him that I still had it . So we went up to my room and I gave it back to him . And then we started looking at all the other cards and kind of looking at each one and reliving some of our old battles . ( laughs ) And then I honestly don't know how it happened but there was this , like , tingly electric gravity between us and it kept pulling us closer and closer together . And then suddenly we were kissing . ( gasps ) I know , I was , like , shocked too . It was literally like every fantasy I ever had was coming true in one simultaneous moment . And so we kept kissing for like five minutes and then , you know , both of us getting more and more into it . And then really suddenly , he pulled away . Like super abruptly . And he got out of there as fast as he could . He didn't say anything to me as he was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like magic . T ! So what happened though ? He completely ignored me the next day at school , so I tried texting him . But he was just like "" Who is this , how 'd you get my number ? "" So I mustered up the courage to go talk to him after school . Well , I wasn't gon na show you this , but whatever . Here . Hey , Mad , I know you're in school right now but I wanted to show you my latest triumph . I think I'm gon na go try to talk to [Sonny] again . Wish me luck . Hey . Hey . [Teel] So biology sucked today , huh ? Yeah . Listen , I got ta go . [Teel] I was actually wondering if maybe we could ... Hey , that that fag you were talking about ? Yeah . I don't know what he wants , but he's not gon na find it here . I think I know what he wants . [Teel] Can we go somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Teel] I just was ... Whoa ! Get away ! Get away , assbag . [Teel] Get off of me ! That was a mistake . [Teel] Get off ! Like that ? Oh , [Sonny] , [Sonny] , I want you so bad ! ( laughs ) ( crying ) T . Yeah . T , I can't believe they would do that . Is this gon na be weird now ? [Madison] Us ? Yeah . [Madison] No , T . Yeah , it's gon na be totally weird . This is why I didn't tell you for so long , Mad , because I knew things would get all weird . No . No , they're not weird . Yeah , well , if you say so . T , I'm serious . You got ta give me a break . I just found out tonight while I was in my underwear . ( rings ) T , wake up . I have an idea . Don't you ever sleep ? What if you start a gay-straight alliance at your school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any in your area . You could connect to other gay kids at your school . You could maybe even help them out . Yeah , help them get the crap kicked out of them . No , T , that's the whole point of GSA , so that wouldn't happen . I'm sorry , not interested . T , you need support . Look , I really appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not ready for that . T , you can't just sit there and suffer . All by yourself . Yeah , I can . [Madison] No , T , you need to tell someone . I did . No , someone other than me . People need to know so that they can help you . They're the one's who need help . Fine . Fine , then make them deal with you . Mad , stop pushing me , okay ? I'm not pushing you . I don't want to be your cause anymore . You're not my cause , you're my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just look at the website I'm sending to you . You just posted that on my wall . [Madison] So what ? So now everyone's gon na think I'm gay . [Madison] No , T , it's just a link . It's a link to a gay website , Mad ! It's for straight people too . You don't , you don't send that to someone unless you think they're gay ! You are gay . Well , I'm sorry if I don't want to flaunt my sexuality all over the internet like some people I know . Why are you being such a jerk ? Because you just outed me to all my friends ! What friends , T ? You have like 78 acquaintances on Facebook who don't even see your feed because you don't post anything . T . ( sighs ) ( rings ) ( @slow_music ) ? It's been a while since I've been here ? It's a cold day in hell and ? I will be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it judges everyone ? Beautifully broken , just like everyone ? Let's never say goodbye ? Let's never say goodbye ? Here we are ? In this park , chasing stars ? Staring at the distance ? The distance ? Hold my hand , take a chance ? Forget your plans , just sit back and listen ? And listen ? All these moments that we share ? I wouldn't trade them for any reason ? Any reason ? Do you remember all the nights ? You 'd stay awake to help me fight ? Your smile's all I need to survive ? As long as you're with me , I'm alright ? Let's never say goodbye ? Let's never say goodbye ? You and I , side by side ? Wasting time , laughing about the nether Here we are at my dad's retirement party . Wow , look at those amazing decorations . Aren't they incredible ? Oh , but the cake . Oh yeah , the cake , yummy . I wonder who made it ? Shh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations . Well , almost everybody . I wish my friend [Teel] was here . But we can't have it all now , can we ? ( dings ) ( dings ) ( dings ) ( rings ) Hey . What's with the cards ? Okay . It's alright . There's a smudge on that one . ( laughs ) Mad , you don't need to be fixed . Mad , really , it's alright . Yeah . Yeah . You used to make me climb around the back because supposedly the front was being guarded . I 'd get all these scratches all over my arms from the bark . ( crying ) Me too . Yeah , I know . What do you mean ? ( knocking ) [Madison's_Father] Maddie , it's almost nine ! Okay , Daddy ! Wait , what are you talking about ? Keep watching what ? [Madison] . Okay , I promise . You're kinda starting to freak me out . [Madison] . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop . ( crying ) Hi , I 'd like to report a crime . ( rings ) You shouldn't have done that . Are you okay ? What happened , did the cops come ? Did they arrest him ? Yeah , they came . And my dad cleared things up . It was all a misunderstanding . What do you mean , cleared it up ? Didn't you tell them ? I told them that I made it up . What ? T , I don't think we should be talking anymore , okay ? [Madison] , what the hell ? I have to be there for my dad right now . He's going through a lot , so ... [Teel] No , no , [Madison] . You need to do something . Good luck with the show . Wait , [Madison] ! [Madison] ! Alack , there lies more peril ... Alack , there lies more ... Alack , there lies more peril in thine eye ... ( sighs ) ( @calm music ) ( laughs ) Hey , sweetie . Mom . Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , Karina and Sydney are picking me up . Also I think everyone's going to go out afterwards , so I might be home late . You know , grandma's coming to your opening tomorrow . Okay . I'm very proud of you . Mom , got ta run my lines . Okay , I'm going . ( mumbles ) Alack , there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords . ( sighs ) Obviously all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations . Well , almost everybody . I wish my friend [Teel] was here . But ... I wish my friend [Teel] was here . I wish my friend [Teel] was here . But we can't have it all now , can we ? Hey , Mad ! Right now I am on the run . I stole my grandma's car and a bunch of money from my dad's sock drawer and I told my director a whole story about having , like , a dire family emergency and he bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good actor . ( laughs ) And now here I am on the road . I know it's a little bit extreme , but you're not taking my calls . So California here I come . Apparently there are nothing but trees in Illinois . Oh , look , a field . I guess that's the end of that ... Oh my god , a field ! Mad , if you don't pick up , I'm gon na be forced to do something drastic . ( screams ) Oh man , it's so pretty . Hey , Mad , really wish you would talk to me right now . I'm trying to stay awake over here . Nothing a caffeinated beverage can't fix . ( sighs ) ( dings ) Oh , it's my mom . She's probably freaking out . I bet she's called the cops like three times . This could be a very pointless trip . 19 messages from my mom , six from my dad . And yes , they have called the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into a fugitive . Morning , Mad ! I hope you're seeing this . I never knew it would be so beautiful . ( @camera_clicking ) ( @upbeat_music ) Hey , Mad . Just got here . The GPS sent me on kind of a wild goose chase and then I realized that you're on South Maple and not North Maple , and those are very different addresses . ( rings ) Oh , you're calling me . Guess where I am right now ... T , you shouldn't have come here ! Go home ! I figured you might say that , but ... My dad is right downstairs ! Don't worry , I'm coming around the back . What are you doing ? [Teel] I'm coming up . No ! T ! Oh my god . Oh my god , T , no . T ! No ! Shh ! Oh my god , T . T , no way . T , you're gon na kill yourself . [Teel] What else is new ? [Madison] Oh my god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , he will kill you . Alack , there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords . You have to leave . Oh , will thou leave me so unsatisfied ? What do you want ? The exchange of thy love's faithful vow from mine . [Madison's_Father] Maddie ? I'll be right down , Dad ! I had to see you in person . No , T .

Let's clean up before Bama gets here . I don't want her telling me I'm a lousy housekeeper . Oh , shoot . I got ta get ready . We're supposed to be at the bank . Why do you have to go to the bank ? Because we need money for stuff , like your braces . But I don't want braces . I want a video game player . Charlie , your mama's gon na tell you something true . No matter what you choose to do or be , life is easier if you're pretty . It does a girl no good to be good at video games . Knock , knock . Hey , y'all . Hi , Mama . Hey , Bama . Hey , Bama . It's hotter than a fur coat in Marfa out there . Guess you're just gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please don't start . I'm trying to get ready . Hey , Mama , that laundry was folded . It will be when I get through . Hi , Bama . Jenna . One , two . Whoo ! I'm so glad to see you . Give Bama a great big kiss right there . Look how big you're getting . How's it going , Cassie ? Well , I'm a two-pack-a-dayer trying to quit smoking , that's how it's going . You know what gum with nicotine tastes like ? Gum with nicotine . How's the knee ? Oh , doesn't work and keeps me up all night . Sounds like my last two husbands . Heh . What are you gon na do if the bank turns you down ? No idea . Well , it ain't a sin to be poor , but it's damned inconvenient . Well , what do y'all think ? You're either a magician or twins . Mama , you look pretty . You sure do . It's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in that outfit . That's what I'm counting on . Like you said , ' Use it until you lose it . ' Heck , I've lost it and I'm still using it . What smells like pumpkin pie ? Oh , it's me . These scientists did a test and figured out that the smell of pumpkin brings blood How to a man's you-know-what faster than anything else . Where 'd you hear that ? I read it in some woman's magazine . August 2006 issue . Reese Witherspoon was on the cover . Rex , come on , we got ta scoot . Babies , be good to your Bama . Bye , Mama . Bye , Mama . Owl Dang it . I just broke my nail . Sugar , no one's looking at your nails . Been married to you nine years , I haven't gotten to your nails yet . Come on . Now , Sam , don't slouch like you do . Knockers up . I am so nervous . Yeah , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he's gay . Well , I did say ' whatever it hikes . "" Oh , baby , how did we get ourselves into such an awful mess ? A lot of people asking those questions these days . Samantha Horton . Hell's bells , I do not need Carol Reed telling me how perfect her life is . Hey , I dumped her for you . You got the big prize . Don't tell her why we're here . Hey , Carol . Hi . It's been forever . Don't you look pretty . I do believe you were wearing that same dress the last time I saw you . Well , aren't you observant . Jim and I were just here on business , but tomorrow we're off to Hawaii and then we're going to New York to do a little shopping . We all got to stimulate the economy , right ? Bless your heart , always thinking of others . Bye-bye . Y'all travel safe . Will do . Bye . Mrs . Horton , Mr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we're here about , uh , this letter . Well , I 'd say it's a bit more than a letter . This is a notice of intent to foreclose . Yes , and we know we're seriously behind in our payments , but the rates suddenly jumped so high-As adjustable rates do . Mr . Sweeny , it's like I was trying to tell you on the telephone , my physical therapy job just got phased out and Rex here , well , he hurt his knee so bad that he had to quit his construction job and get surgery . We're just trying to pay back the medical bills . The heeling's been e whole let slower than I 'd hoped . I sympathize , but mortgage payments must be maintained-It's not just about the mortgage . We're strapped . Completely . Getting dinner on the table , it's hard . We need more time . But , Mrs . Horton , I can't really give you-You can call me Sam . Sam . That's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Very much . But , uh , there's nothing I can do . With the current financial situation , this bank must hike a zero-tolerance position on non-payment . But what about the government hailing you out to help us out ? Where's the help ? All I can tell you is that unless we receive payment on the 15th of this month , foreclosure proceedings will begin . And we'll lose our home . Yes . That is what foreclosure means . I'm sorry . No , you're not . Not really . Even though you're plenty at fault here too . The day we met you , you told us that a subprime ARM loan made good sense and not to worry about rate adjustments because we would be able to refinance before the loan resets . Then you told us it would be ' advantageous for us to enhance our income statement to help facilitate the approving process . "" Those were your words , exactly . Now , I don't think any of us remembers exactly what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , with a taupe shirt and a cream tie . It had a quarter-sized hot sauce shin on it . You were worried because you were getting ready to take your photo ID . There's the tie and there's the shin . Now , what exactly don't I remember , exactly ? Like I said . At least you got a month's extension . It's something . Is it ? What's gon na make it better next month ? Chocolate milk shakes and cheese fries . That will make it better for about five minutes , but I'll take it . Here's my application . I know you guys aren't hiring , but if you could have the manager keep that on file ? Thanks . You're really desperate , huh ? I would join the Army if I could wear heels . We 'd hire you at the bar if we could . I know you would . There's nothing promising for Rex Not a thing . Nobody's even hiring . If there were any construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy with a bum knee . Gosh , this must be killing him . You know men and pride . Men are complicated . No , they're not . Men are easy . "" I'm thirsty , "" "" I'm hungry , "" "" I'm horny . "" That's men . Although not necessarily in that order . You guys , I never thought I 'd say anything quite as sappy as ' it was not supposed to turn out this way , "" but it wasn't . When they were scouting Rex for UT , I already had the drapes picked out for the pool house . You weren't crazy . Handsome white running back is worth his weight in gold . I just thought we were gon na be the next Angie Harmon and Jason Sehorn . Then he got knocked down . You got knocked up . Yeah . Hey , wait a minute . Here's something . ' Kind Touch Health Spa . Licensed massage therapists . "" I'm licensed . I don't know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just skin . It makes them feel better . Doesn't say they're hiring , but it's worth a call . It's all the way in Lareena . It's more than an hour's drive . Well , there's nothing here . You were smart to go and become a lawyer . My mom said I was too pretty for law school . My mama said I was too skinny to get a husband . My mom said to always wear lipstick , even if you're just going to the market . Well , to Texas moms . Texas moms . Texas moms . Your usual time , you little devil . Okay , I've got to go now . All right , bye-bye . Hi , there . Can I help you ? Hi . My name's Samantha Horton , and I called about the massage therapy interview ? Oh , that's right . Here's my resume . Hi . Hi there . Well , I'm Jacie . Hello . And this here is my partner , Doreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thing . Thank you . And I can spot a pageant smile . What did you win ? I was Miss Bixby Hills . Runner-up , Miss Piedmont . I dropped my baton . Well , I entered in Miss Texas , but then I got pregnant and married . Now I got three kids . I'm dying to have babies . You were smart to start young . I'm trained in shiatsu , and deep tissue , but I can pretty much do any kind of massage y'all want . Well , look at you . I'm a real fast learner , and I'm just desperate for a job . Can you start tomorrow ? Really ? That's it ? Pretty much , baby . Thank you . Who's starving ? I could eat a buttered monkey . Yay ! Breakfast for supper . Yeah , we're celebrating Mama's new job . So now I can play Hag football ? Flag football is way down on the list of things we need to be paying for . Please ? Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there's the team photo and equipment . And what if you break your glasses ? But- Conversation is over . Hey , hon , I didn't hear your motorcycle . That's because I sold it . Rex , you loved that thing . Yeah , I kind of like having electricity too . Baby , I know that wasn't easy . Good riddance . You know what doctors call them ? Donor-cycles . Are we rich now ? No . Hey , sweetheart , what's it like at that Kind Touch Health Spa ? What's it like ? Oh , no , a bee . Watch out , Brady , they can smell your fear . Hey . Mama . It's all right , I got it . You know what , it was real nice . Rich clients , big tips . Yeah ? Maybe I should ditch my job at the salon and come rub some backs with you . Unless they're mole-y or hairy . Woman , you wax hoo-has . Yeah , I remove the hair , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing . Daddy , what is a hoo-ha ? Camptown ladies sing this song Hoo-has , hoo-has Camptown track is Eve miles long Oh , hoo-he day Hi . Here I am . Oh , hey , honey . Welcome . Why don't you come on back and meet the other girls , okay ? We got a bit of a lull right now , but when that Cowboys-Redskins game is done , we are gon na be plenty busy . Come on . Okay . All right . Here we go . Okay , ladies , say hi to Sam . Hey , honey , welcome back . Hi . Okay , now , just real quick , I started this business 15 years ago . I wanted to be a novelist , and I still do , but this pays the bills a whole lot better . Doreen used to be a dancer . Well , cruise ships mostly , but some dinner theatre . Now , she's been partners with me for 10 years . Isn't that right ? Yeah . Tanya's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and she is also an amazing tattoo artist . Oh , and this here is Emma , our barely-legal-looking newbie . How long you been here , sweetie ? Uh , two months today . So nice . Hey , hon , you got a client in 4 , why don't you scoot on over . All right . Okay . And you're all licensed massage therapists ? Sure , yeah , we all have licenses , and we all give massage . It's a teensy bit more than that . What do you mean ? Well , like my writing teacher always says : ' Why don't you show me , not tell me ? ' Come on over here , I'll show you . Let me just get these open here . Hi , Richard . This is one of those two-way jobs , you know , like they have in all the cop shows . How are you doing ? Pretty good . How are you ? I'm great . Oh , I love that SVU . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama is Jayne Mansfield , so you know those breasts are real . Now , for safety , we always bring the first-time clients into this room . It's above board , nobody does anything they're not comfortable with . You understand ? Wow . You understand ? Yeah , I guess . Okay . What am I gon na do now ? I guess that's why they didn't show me around the first day . Wanted to ease me into it . Guess I'll have to find something else , or maybe Rex will get a job or maybe that lottery ticket I've got in my purse has three good numbers on it . Hey , Dee , what's up ? It's Rex . You kind of need to come pick him up . He's in no condition to drive . You know how it gets in here when the Cowboys lose . I'm on my way . Dee , isn't it hard being on your feet in your condition ? I'm used to it . Heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I'm not pregnant . And it's good for business . Behind the bar , the big boobs keep them here , and at closing time she comes out and the belly sends them home . Ha , ha , ha . Fair enough . Stupid . Where is he ? He's cleaning up in the john . We'll help him get into the truck . Yeah , he's gon na need it . I can walk , man , I can walk . Dude , you can't walk . Rex had a rough day , Sam . And your mom took the kids , told him to come blow off some steam . Yeah , well , good idea , Mom . Thank you , Phil . Sure thing . Take care of my boy . So I heard you got a job . That one in Lareena , right ? That's so awesome . Yeah , I don't think that's gon na work out . I don't know what I'm gon na do . Sometimes I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this isn't you . You're Samantha Dale Horton . You're the prettiest girl this town has ever seen , and you always get what you want . Besides , I've spent too many years being jealous of you to feel sorry for you now . You'll figure this out . I am so sure of it . I wish I was . Hey , I love you . Love you . You call me tomorrow . Okay . Well , folks , if you moved to Texas ... Damn it , Rex , we're almost out of gas . We're looking at temperatures in the 90s all week long , possibly hitting triple digits by the weekend . Dang gas guzzler . You look good . Well , you sure don't . What were you thinking ? Look , I spent all day standing outside of Kyle's Lumber Lot with the other day laborers trying to pick up some odd job that would pay enough for me to sign up my son for flag football . Rex . Hon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of that store , and I could see it on their faces . ' Look how far the football hero has fallen . "" I'm sorry . I had a bad day too . Stupid gas-guzzling piece of junk . Declined . Rex , where's your wallet ? It's , uh ... It's in my pocket . A dollar ? Damn it , Rex , this is not what I signed up for . This is America . A girl this pretty , she's not supposed to be poor . I'm sorry , I know that sounds all braggy and unfair and awful , but you know what ? It's true . You know what ? Dee was right . She was right . I am Sam Horton . I am Sam Horton , and I do not let life get me down . I do what I have to do , and I don't get defeated . Rex . Jacie ? Hi , it's Sam . Sam Horton . I'm so sorry that I walked out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avoid . Vacuum . V-A-C-U-U-M . Vacuum . Good . Now tableau . Tableau . T-A-So now can I go out for Hag football ? No . It's not T-A ?

There's nothing to be scared of , I mean it . Sorry . It's Mama's first day at work , and I can't pick you up at school , so to say I'm sorry , I put two desserts in both your lunches . Wow , your new job's great . Come on , scoot . I'm sitting behind Mama . No , you aren't . You went last time . Mama . You know , and I pride myself on running a safe , clean business . We provide a reliable service at reasonable rates . We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open Saturday to Thursday , noon to midnight , but this being Friday , payday , we start early and stay till the last one leaves . It's real important that I work only when my kids are at school . Oh , that's fine . We do a huge lunch crowd . All the outfits are in a room in the back , but each of these rooms have everything you need . There's condoms and oils and such . Oh , and drinks and Viagra are on the house . You give away Viagra ? It pays for itself . The little blue pill keeps us in the black . We were worried when the economy tanked , but turns out that this is the most recession-proof business there is . And what about the police ? Oh , well , let's just say doughnuts ain't the only thing they're getting for free . Alrighty , let's get you on in the back room , because everybody's here on Friday . Alrighty . Now , for everyone's protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar , Emma wants to be called Salome . She won't do anything that's not mentioned in the Bible . Lucky for us , that's not all limiting . Tanya is Margarita . Unless the guy's into Asian chicks , then I'm Sake . That's right , and I'm Big Mama . I do mostly fetish stuff . I got me some kick-ass feet . So you , I think , we are gon na call you Brandy . Because you look like you go down real smooth . Brandy , okay . Now , like you saw yesterday , we screen everybody upfront , but if you got any problems at all , you holler . All right ? You know how to use a gun , baby ? No . I'll teach you . Tanya used to be a bounty hunter . It's crazy . Anyway , you got any questions ? No , I just feel like I might be sick . First time's the hardest . It's like the first time you kill someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on . What can I say ? I love sex . I'm getting paid to do something I love . That is such a blessing . Right ? You know , the work is what it is . You got to get into your own headspace on that , but at the end of the day ... Beats the hell out of waitressing . Nine a.m . Well , it is Friday , that's for sure . Okay , girls . This will help some . I'm still getting used to it . You don't even look old enough to drink . What brought you here ? I ran away from home to try out for American Idol , but they said I wasn't ready yet . So I'm saving money for a singing coach . You can't get home ? My family's Pentecostal . They're not real supportive of my Hollywood ambitions . I kind of liked being all rebellious at first , but now , I don't know . The money's good , but God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need that thought in my head right now . Emma , honey , you're Room 1 , and , Sam , you're in Room 4 . There's some pretty little outfits beck there for you , okay ? Oh , that feels really good , honey . Mm-mm-mm . Well , thank you . So where you from ? Am I supposed to answer that ? No . Sorry , I'm just kind of nervous . It's my first time . Not massaging , but , you know ... Really ? Yeah , me too . Oh . Well , now , look at us , two peas in a pod . So are you married ? Yeah . That's why I'm here . What the hell ? Well , that wasn't respectful . This may be my first time , but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to hit me . A man is not supposed to put down his wife . When was the last time you told her she was beautiful ? I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but women , we fall in love with our ears . Ah . You remember that I said that . Oh . Dang it . I am so sorry . That's my phone . I forgot to turn it off . Oh , it's my daughter's school , I need to hike this . Hey . Hey , baby , what's up ? No , you didn't . You won the whole spelling bee ? Well , with what word ? Diphthong ? Now , that's a hard word . Do you know how to spell diphthong ? What ? Okay , you know what , we're gon na celebrate tonight . Mama loves you . Bye . Can you believe that ? This isn't quite what I imagined . You know , your kid calling , me hiking about my wife . Maybe I should just- Okay , please . Please , you can't go . Look , I really need this job , and-Can I just have a do-over ? Huh ? I promise that you'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it right . And you know what ? Maybe I can help you get a little bit more of what you need at home . Now , when was the last time that you bought something special for your wife ? I don't know . Uh - Uh-On her birthday , I guess , but-Okay , well , then , you need to get her something for no reason . And I'm not talking about flowers . I mean something real fancy , like an expensive watch . I'm sorry , honey , this is not what I paid for . Lookit , this isn't quite what I had in mind . I know what you paid for . You're a very pretty lady and all , but I just-It's kind of not the right feeling I'm getting here somehow . Okay , this is what you paid for . You see all that money right there ? That's just from one day . I mean , I got ta worry about the kids , and the bills , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do it until we get ahead . I can do this . It's gon na be fine . And it's gon na be fine . Ugh ... Oh , my God , I'm gon na have to pull over . Hey , Sam , what's up ? I need some girlfriend talk , right now . Well , stop looking so shocked . I'm sorry , Sam , but this is my shocked face . If you want me to look different , you might need to say something less shocking . I was just hoping for a little sympathy . Thought Pretty Women was your favorite movie . Oh , God , I love that movie . When is Julia Roberts gon na make another one that good ? Dee , focus . Sorry . I just needed somebody to talk to . I couldn't tell Laura , she 'd have me arrested . And , God , please don't tell Phil . Of course I won't tell Phil . What wife tells her husband that someone like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just_I don't know . Wow . That's what I made today . Holy sugar . I'm not proud of it . You know , you work in a bar , you kind of stop judging people . Just please be careful , and the sooner you stop , the better . I will . Thank you . So , what's it like ? Well , to be honest , the thing they want most is for you to lie to them . They wan na know their guts are small and their johnsons are big , even if the truth is sharing you right in the face . Oh , my Lord . Oh , God , please tell me I'm not crazy . It sounds like men aren't the only one's who wan na be lied to . You got that right . You go home . I got ta go tell my fat husband he's hot . Hey , everybody , I'm home . Hey , babe . Hey . I made spaghetti . I can see that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went shopping . What did you get ? Let me see . For the spelling champ . Suzy Style Doll ? And for you . Thank you . Thank you , Mommy . And I think that's for you . Does this mean I can play football ? Yes , it does . Yes ! Hey . Go out for a pass . Can we afford this ? We can now . Oh ... I'll work with him . Come here , buddy . So , what exactly does an actuary do ? Um , it's a little hard to explain . You're gon na be fine . It's beautiful .

Well , whatever you two want , it's on me . Thanks , Sam . Little girls ' . Be right back . I know you're not supposed to say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little too much ? Dee , come on . You know I've always dreamt of not having to look at price tags . And Rex doesn't suspect anything ? I mean , the watch , the earrings , the necklace ? What do you tell him ? That they're all fake . Come on . Men don't know from jewelry . Well , that's the truth . Know what's weird ? Nobody even wants an explanation . It's like I'm Santa Claus . Just as long as I keep giving them presents , they can see me searing through the sky with flying reindeer . Don't worry , I know what I'm doing . You awake ? Yeah . I can't sleep . Me too . What's wrong ? It's just-Look , I'm happy you're working , and I'm trying to keep some perspective on this , but it's killing me that you're the breadwinner and I'm not . Baby .

Well , then the other one , then . As you can see , going on behind me right now is a major bust of an alleged prostitution and drug ring . Apparently , there has been e months-long surveillance probe conducted by Mayor Summerlin . All pert of her campaign promise to bring law and order to Lareena . Summerlin is in a very tight re-election race and no doubt she hopes an event like this will help to put her over the edge . Now we can see the police are starting to bring out some of the alleged johns . The poor bastards . Ho-ho-ho . What , do they charge by the pound ? You don't have to shake the sheets to find her . The name of the establishment is the Kind Touch Health Spa , but locals here say they've long known that ... Oh , my gosh . Phil , turn that off now . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll keep you updated . Okay , now we're talking . Shut up . - along with the alleged prostitutes . Of course , they will be held separately . The big question tonight is-Hey , Rex , she looks kind of like your wife , doesn't she ? I said , shut up . We do hope to hear from the mayor end the police chief for more details . They'll be holding a press conference and of course wow bring that to you as . soon as it happens . I knew it would end like this . Dee , please . No , you bail someone out of jail , you get to talk . At first , you did it to save your family , I get that , but then it was for you . You threw your whole life away for what's on your ears and around your neck . You're home . Oh , what did I do ? What am I supposed to say to him ? How am I gon na fix this ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rex , I'm so sorry . I know that I've really messed things up , and I'll do just about anything to make it right . So just look at me . Talk to me . Yell at me , swear at me , hit me , I don't care . All night , I've been thinking about something . That summer after graduation ? You and me going-Going to the vet to put Barney down . I loved that dog too . And we get there , and we're sitting in the parking lot holding that old dog between us , petting him , him loving the attention ... and both of us knowing it's his last day of life . And then you sang to him . That Beatles song . ' In My Life . ' And then I-I couldn't do it . I couldn't go in . And you took him , and you carried him in ... and you held him ... till he died . You did that for me . And any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , and I 'd think of that girl . And now when I think of you , it's gon na be this . Winner of the 1999 Miss Bixby Beauty Pageant is Samantha Dale . Mama ? Thank you , Eric . Hey , what are you doing up ? I heard the TV . Well , I'm sorry I woke you . Come here . You're watching your pageant video . Yeah . I like the part where you say what you 'd tell the president to do to fix the Middle East . Did you ever tell the president ? No . Oddly enough , he decided not to consult Miss Bixby Hills about international relations . Why are you watching this ? Just revisiting a time in my life when I felt like I was doing everything right . You look sad . Do you want me to sing to you , like you do when I'm sad ? I think if you did that , I just might fall apart . You're sweet , though . Then should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think they're gon na let me wear makeup in jail ? I'll try to smuggle you some . Thank you for helping me . I'm your friend . I haven't been a very good friend lately . Well , friendship isn't quid pro quo . Wow , you are a lawyer . What's your mom say about all this ? "" It's the reason you have more than one kid . So you can ditch the screw-ups . "" That sounds like your mom . All right , let's get down to business . It seems this whole thing was orchestrated by the mayor's re-election team . They're trying to position her as the champion of traditional values . How did she even find out about us ? Know someone by the name of Emma Hollings ? Oh , my God . She went to some religious group . Christian Fellowship Lodge . That's it . She found a lot of old people with time on their hands and cell phones . They bombarded the police with calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the mayor decided it was divine intervention . I sent her there . This is all my fault . They're looking to charge you with felony promotion of prostitution and possession of cocaine . You're looking at two years . Oh , my God . Are you still using ? No . Never again . I feel like dog crap . Well , you're gon na feel agitated , depressed . I mean , the works for a few months , and then , honestly , periodic cravings for the 10 next years . Guess the first two years will be while I'm in jail . Well , maybe not . I think we can use this election to our advantage . Don't they wan na look tough on crime ? But what they want more is publicity . The more attention that Summerlin can get from this , the better for her . The more we help her , the more likely she is to help us . And the best way to get attention is if we have good names to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the community ? Well , yeah , but I don't wan na hurt any of those guys . Well , I can't worry about them , I'm representing you . Besides , all the johns ever get is a slap on the wrist . There's personal and professional embarrassment , but they do more sleeping on the couch than jail time . I just don't know . Well , fine . Go to jail . Don't see your kids for two years . Okay , tell me what you need . That's better . And what about the girls ? Is this gon na reduce their jail time ? It might . I know it's a cash business and your clients used a lot of fake names , but-Not with me , they didn't . I need some good names , Sam . Truckers and frat boys ain't gon na do a thing for us . We need our Eliot Spitzers and Tiger Woods . What about a circuit court judge ? You're kidding me . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , graduated cum laude from-I know who he is . I had a crush on him for years . Well ? Let's just say sometimes small things come in big packages . Let's just stick to what we can use in court , shall we ? This is great . I need you to write down anyone else you can think of . I'm gon na need a lot more paper . What about the cuddle guy ? Cuddle guy ? Davis P . Lowell . Hedge fund manager , 44 . Three kids , Karen , Kathy and Keily . Lives right here in Lareena and likes to be held for hours . Oh , that's kind of sweet . Wearing only a diaper ? Okay , that's less sweet . I don't know how it is you do what you do . Well ... Beats the hell out of waitressing . Klaus Kransing , 52 , oil company lobbyist . He 'd fly up every Thursday during his wife's book club . When he 'd get all hot and bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds sexy in German . He gave her a diamond watch . She earned it . I pawned it for a down payment on Rex's Harley . Things any better at home , darling ? Still sleeping on the couch . We're doing our best to hide it from the kids . That's about to get a whole lot harder . Arnie Vanderbaush , 46 . He's a defense contractor from El Paso . And I think that's it . What about Jim Reed ? What , Carol ' the bitch of Bixby Hills "" husband , Jim Reed ? He came in , but I sent him home . He's been a regular for years . As much as I 'd like to stick it to Carol , please don't put him on the list . Okay . Okay . I mean , this is incredible . If we play this right , we're looking at minimal time for all of you . How many names we got ? Sixty-nine . That's , uh- Appropriate ? That's the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are gon na walk it over to the mayor's office personally . And her team has already tipped the press off . They know it's coming . I always knew that Sam Horton was nothing but trash . You know , I got a real common name , honey . A lot of guys around here got my name . Better hope none of them are on the list . Good morning . I heard my gynecologist was on the list . I don't even know what to make of that . Well , if my husband's on that list , I'm gon na lake all his stuff , put it on his bass boat and set it on fire . Screw that . Set his stuff on fire , sure , but sell the bass boat , girl . You can get good money for that thing . Ooh-whee , you're right about that . Heh . Don't this remind you about what happened in Odessa a few years ago ? Yeah . Heads up . Poor thing . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . I heard there's a lot of big shots on that list . Businessmen , doctors , lawyers . Lawyers ? Those gals must have been really hard up for cash . Some things even a hooker shouldn't have to do . But we don't wan na stay at Grandma Sarah's house . She thinks apples are for dessert . She makes us go outside and play . Okay , kids , that's enough . You say your goodbyes to your mama . We got a long ride ahead of us . Why can't she come with us ? Your mama can't leave town right now . We've been all over this , son . That's right . Listen to your daddy . Come here . Come here . Ooh . I want good reports , okay ? No matter what happens to me , I want y'all to know that my life has been very full because I've brought the three of you into the world . Mama , are you gon na die ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s go now . You two head for the truck . Help your sister into her car seat . I want Mommy to go . Go on , baby . I'm right behind y'all . Meet you at the car . I'm gon na come out and say goodbye . I always thought that was the saddest sound in the world . The person's zipper on their suitcase when you're not going with them . My daddy used to hike business trips , and I just hated that sound . I think it's better for the kids to get away from all this talk . Yeah , you're right . Maybe when y'all come back , maybe we could-Don't . Well , maybe-Maybe when all this is over , we could just think about moving and starting over ? Rex , please look at me . I can't look at you , Sam , which is real tough , because looking at you used to be just about one of my favorite things to do . Okay . Bye , skunks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Bye , Mommy . Bye , Mommy . Bye , Mama . You hike care , Sam . You're up early . Couldn't sleep . Thanks for staying with me , Mama . No time to be alone . I keep thinking I've hit bottom , then every day it just gets lower . I been up all night , thinking I just-Well , just realizing that I must have raised you all wrong . See ? New low . I mean , I forgive you because you're my only child , but how could you do what you did with those men ? For my family . Well , it makes my skin crawl . Thank God your father's dead . Oh , can you not completely destroy me until I've had some coffee ? Do you want some ? Sure . You like it strong , right ? So strong it'll walk right into my cup . I think your problem is I gave you too much self-esteem . What the hell ? It's true . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be Miss Texas or go to Hollywood and marry somebody famous . I wasted my life on your father . I wanted better for you . Your father went to a hooker once . Please do not tell me these things . Ever since this happened , people think they can tell me anything . The check-out girl at the Save-A-Lot told me she doesn't like to do it doggy style . Want some biscuits or something ? Sure . Is it just disgusting ? I'm picturing disgusting . Yeah . Yeah , sometimes it's real disgusting . Oh , honey . But it's kind of like an actress playing a part . All the attention I got back , that was something . All those men , some rich , some powerful , all treating me like I was the best thing in their lives . I guess there's just a little part of me that needed that more than I should . Anyway , now I just wish I could crawl up in a ball and make it all go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil than face the ladies at the salon . You think the paper's come yet ? I'll go check . Sam ! There she is . Oh , my Lord . We've all heard of the hooker with a heart of gold , but what about one with total recall ? Former beauty queen Samantha Horton , 28 , of Bixby Hills , Texas , has remembered Oh , thank God . Oh , my God . - Lareena's Kind Touch Health Spa , currently under indictment for prostitution and drug possession . The names of 69 of her customers have hit the papers this morning in what is already known as the List . Why is this national news ? It's about sex and not about them . Tricia , beck to you . Well , folks , the List has turned into the Line today , as police round up the suspected johns in the . story that ' . s got the whole town and much of the country talking-Now , behind me , you see the Lareena Men's Community Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police headquarters simply can't handle that kind of volume . And , as with everything connected to this story , Ah ! It brings out the crowds , the strong reactions and people looking to make some money . Over here , we have e group of local entrepreneurs selling some T-shirts . Let's take a look at a couple of them . This one has all 69 names on the back . And there's another one over here that says ' My dad went to Lareena and all I got was this lousy T-shirt and a new stepdad . ' Now , you'll also see plenty of women here who are videotaping the proceedings . You cover your face . I'm Tricia Wong , reporting . Now back to you , Roger . Will the defendants please rise for sentencing ? It is my understanding that this sentencing is pursuant to a plea bargain . And that you have waived time and agreed that I can sentence you immediately . Yes , Your Honor . Sentence is as follows for each defendant : Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a $100 penalty assessment . You are to be remanded immediately to begin sentence . This court is adjourned . That's all they get for ruining our lives ? Well , you're still harlots , and you'll always be harlots . The Lord has given us a warm day on which I have decided to address a subject that has made a great number of us hot under the collar , a couple of whom , shockingly , are in the ministry . Our community and our congregation have experienced e greet dee ! of pain and betrayal in these pest few months , and today I would like to talk about a concept that many of us have been grappling with : Forgiveness . What is forgiveness ? Who deserves forgiveness ? Are some things unforgivable ? The Bible tells us that forgiveness is essential for life . It frees us from pest wrongs and gives us hope for the future . The problem is it's just too darn quiet in here . It's not natural for a mother of three to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend this much time alone . I half wish a Jehovah's Witness would stop by . I finally have a wish come true , and I wish that ? I'm gon na give her a piece of my mind . Sweet Jesus . This is not gon na be pretty . I think they're gon na beat the crap out of me . Sam Horton , we know you're in there . We saw you in the window . Well ... Hey , y'all . How can I help you ? We 'd like to talk to you . You look like you just came from church . So I guess you don't have any concealed weapons . Anything can be a weapon if you want it to be . Come on in . Okay . Do y'all want some crackers or cookies or something ? Give it up , Sam . We all know this isn't a social visit , so let's get to it . Some of the women here have husbands who you , well , serviced . And some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all here for the same reason . Yes , I know why you're here . If you could just hear me out first . We were broke ... Hat broke . And I don't know if any of y'all have ever been there , but when it happens , and you realize there's a way to make it all go away , well , it's amazing what you're capable of saying yes to . And I know ... I mean , I really know that it is no excuse , but , my whole life , I just always depended on my looks , and I thought this was just gon na be another one of those times . I really thought I was doing the best thing for my family . But in the end , the very thing I was trying to save , I lost . So really , just about the worst thing that you could ever wish on me has happened . And I'm just real sorry , from the bottom of my heart , for the pain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice speech , but , frankly , we don't give a damn about you . We're not here to get an apology or to give forgiveness . Okay , well , then , what are you- ? Why do they come to you ? What do you do that we don't ? How can we make them think about us the way they think about you ? That's why you're here ? Mm-hm . Y'all want tips ? Yes . Oh . Oh , well . All right , then let's talk about that . For what it's worth , Carol , when Jim came to see me , I sent him home . You did ? That's in the past . Right now , let's just focus on the present . Okay , um ... You'll leave here today , tonight , your husbands won't know what hit them . My God , you showed them how to do that ? They wanted me to demonstrate everything . I went through two bunches of bananas . Ugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And happy birthday . It's not till tomorrow , but you're off then , so here . Tanya , thank you . Now , grab a fork . I'm way ahead of you . Make a wish . When I was little , I used to wish that everyone else's wishes would come true , including mine . I thought it would give me brownie points for being unselfish . Hm . It's Jenna's birthday too , right ? Yeah , her party's tomorrow . It's gon na be the first time since me and Rex separated . That'll be tough , huh ? Yeah , but he's doing good . You know , his exterminating thing's going okay , and he's finally getting over that I-can't-play-football anger . Well , that's great . No , actually , it's terrible . I mean , him going and getting all wonderful after he left me . Heh . I know , right ? It's good . We actually make great friends , and he's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He's gon na come and see me get my six-month-clean pin next week . Congratulations . Well , I got ta get to class . Five-dollar tip . Not bad for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie . Even though a year ago I was getting a $1000 tip and a marriage proposal . Minimum wage plus ' keep the change ' doesn't have quite the same kick , does it ? Hey , do you remember how we used to say : ' This sure beats the hell out of waitressing ' ? Yeah . Back then , we were just guessing . He's got ta be one of mine . They're all biters . Could you hold him ? Oh , I'm not really good with - Okay . Whoo ! Sam , I've been thinking . You did an awful thing . Oh , Mama , please , not on my birthday . Let me finish . You did an awful thing , but I think maybe I need to accept some of the blame . You're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I'm about to lose my looks ? No , you got a couple years left . Heh . What I'm saying is you're also smart , capable and strong . You screwed up . But you cleaned up your mess and you moved on . And I think maybe I should've encouraged you to rely more on stuff like that , stuff that lasts longer than beauty . Thanks , Mama . Still doesn't mean you can slouch . Straighten up . Yes , ma'am . I'll go tell them we're ready for the cake . Mama . Hey , how did you do ? I won all this . Go get some more . Go on . Hey , Daddy . Hey , sugar . So how's work ? You know , waitressing . It is what it is . School ? Hard . Scary . Exciting . Well , you look good . You look real good . I'm glad you're looking at me again . I can't believe our baby's 4 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , it's good to share a birthday with your child . It keeps the day from ever being able to get you down . She loved that dollhouse you got her . She wanted a pony . What about you ? What do you want ? You know what I want . I'm taking baby steps . What do you think ? I think that's the second-best birthday present I ever got .

No , Mr . Chance . She still ain't available . We present this controversial newsreel as a public service . In 1930 , Tom Finley ran for his first state office . You all know me . I'm just a plain old dirt farmer , like you folks . And Tom Finley was elected . Tom Finley ran for governor . I'm against loose government loose money and loose women ! And Tom Finley was elected . Tom Finley built a political machine and became Boss Finley . He also built a plain old dirt farmer's shack worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private speedboat . Boss Finley gave away the offshore oil of his state . The oil man made Finley a partner and Boss Finley made his oil partner the governor and kept him in office all these years . Four months ago , Professor Burtus Haven Smith ran against Finley's handpicked man . The only thing you have to fear is Finley himself . Next day , Professor Smith , fired . His home was invaded by hoodlums books and paintings burned on the lawn . Did you recognize any of them , sir ? No . They wore masks like this . I found this button . Yes , sir . I'm president of the Finley Youth Club , and I'm proud of it . But I don ' t know nothing about no book burnings or ... This thing , it could be dropped accidentally on purpose you know what I mean ? - But to date , there has been no probe no police action , no arrests . - Why ? - Shut that contraption off . These are the fruits of Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV network tolerate those filthy , black lies ? - Right here , in the heart of America . - Why , they ought to be ... Thank you , honey . - horsewhipped and shot . And if I wasn't mayor and against violence , I 'd do it myself . Well , if that TV report lied , why not sue them for libel ? If they lied ? You know , you surprise me , Ben . For a man who's smart enough to run a big daily newspaper you sure surprise me . Can't you recognize New York Red propaganda when you see it ? Do you call that TV newsreel fair ? Now , Maribelle , we're all on the same side . - Are we , Ben ? - Fair , you mean ? Well , your father's going on the same network . Same time , same freedom of expression . I 'd say that was pretty fair . A lot fairer than burning books and ... You accusing me , Ben ? Why , Tom Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might be a hot-blooded buck like his daddy ... - Now , Mrs . Norris . ... but he 'd never resort to violence . Never . And you have my personal guarantee that whoever did do it justice will prevail . - Right , sheriff ? - Certainly . What in tarnation are you laughing at ? Nothing , Pa . Nothing at all . Then shut up ! - Yes , sir . - Only idiots laugh at nothing . - Yes , sir . - When I was called from the clay hills where I was born barefoot and hungry , called by the voice of God , which I was ... Will somebody pick up that damn phone ! I ain't never forgot what I was called for . I didn't build a land of milk and honey to see ... - Where you going ? - Get something for that cough . Sit down ! I've hawked and spit all my life and I'll hawk and spit till the end of my days . You can bet on that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to be there . - Why , you know me , Tom . I expect you and your Daughters of Dixie to be there . God bless you , honey . And I expect you to be there too . I'll be there , Mr . Finley . At the press table . You'll be on the platform , at my side , in my support . No , sir . Not so long as you support a gang of juvenile delinquents called Youth Clubs ... - With a free hand to commit mayhem . - Hold it ! Now , maybe you're right . And maybe , just maybe the Finley Youth Club was mixed up in that shindig . That's why I'm gon na publicly disavow , disown and remove my name from the Finley Youth Club . And if my own flesh and blood was one of them hoodlums he's gon na pay , even though it brings shame on the memory of his dead mother . God rest her soul . They say I stole the oil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my state and my people . I also fought the fertilizer trust . I lowered taxes . I saved our hog-raisers from the Chicago meatpackers . A lot of folks like what I did but they don't like the way I did it . But if a bunch of hogs won't come out of your garden when you holler : Then you've got ta use language and methods that hogs and pigs understand . Do you understand , Ben ? Hi . Martini on the rocks . Say , you get any phone calls here for Chance Wayne ? No , sir . Operator ? I 'd like to place a long-distance phone call to Miss Louella Parsons . That's right . Person-to-person , from me , Chance Wayne . Yes , Miss Louella Parsons , the famous movie columnist . In Hollywood . The number is Crestview 1-4222 . Fine . Thank you .

All bartenders become movie stars . Right , Chance ? Oh , well ... What he's trying to say is that I had your job for too long . You know , I designed that uniform you've got on . I copied it from an outfit Cary Grant wore in this Foreign Legion picture . - Looks great on you , kid . - Really ? But kidding aside , fellas , it is great to be back . Louella Parsons don't answer . She know it's Chance Wayne calling ? Operator ? Yeah , well , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . In New York at the Pla ... Oh , no , he's ... He's in Hollywood .

You're my kind of man . You got ambition , ideas , youth . And the good looks to go with them too . But working in a cocktail bar . Of course , I don't blame you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no elbow room for a go-getter . No opportunity for a man who's going places . Yeah , but Mr . Barnaby , you know , sporting goods ? He promised me this job as a salesman in promotional sales . Small potatoes . Let me tell you something , laddie . This here is America . Today you're nobody tomorrow you're somebody . But you got to think big , act big , and you'll be big . Now , I could set you up myself , but ... No , sir . I wouldn't want that . That's the way . You're my kind of man , laddie . In this world , there's only one payoff window . Number one , the winner , success . Now , that can be you . But a man who's going places he needs a place where he can climb , bust out . A place like New York . Now , this here is the ticket that'll get you there . Train leaves at 9:40 tonight . This night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laddie that you come back to St . Cloud number one , riding high on the hog . Well , laddie . But Heavenly , does she know ? She told me to wish you luck and Godspeed . Well , I know , but I wan na talk to her , sir . We made a lot of plans . I plumb forgot . Heavenly and Aunt Nonnie left for New Orleans this morning taking a boat for Europe . Don't you go forgetting her , now . You keep in touch , laddie , you hear ? Mr . Wayne . Mr . Wayne ! Long distance , Mr . Wayne . They can't find Walter Winchell . This is some secretary named Friday . Hello ? Yeah . Well , this is ... Well , when will Mr . Winchell be in ? No . Well , I'm calling for Alexandra Del Lago , who's ... Disappeared ? Oh , no , ma'am . She ... She has been searching America for new faces and she has found them , and she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see , she's producing this film called Youth . Yeah . Starring Chance Wayne and Heavenly Finley . Yeah . They're leaving for Hollywood tomorrow . Boy ? Pencil . Please . Well , the princess is unable to come to the phone right now . She's out . No , out for a walk . Well , sure . Call any time tomorrow . Thank you . Operator ? Say , would you try the Finley residence again ? Good night , mayor . Good night , Mrs . Norris . Bye , mayor . I'll get it , Charles . Hello . Well , who's calling ? Now , listen to me , you lousy son of a ... Boy , you just got a natural talent for being mean and ornery . You want me to like this yellow-bellied ... ? I 'd be grateful if you 'd think for once . What's to think about ? George told me lover-boy came back ... You already told me what George said . But supposing Mr . Wayne didn't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To smear his stink over Heavenly and over me . Isn't that a reason to go and ... ? But supposing he is just passing through . - Well , which is it ? - That's what you're gon na go find out . - Charles . - Yes , sir ? - Where's Heavenly ? - She's down at the beach , sir . Lay out a suit and shirt . I'm going into town tonight . - Yes , sir . - Pa . Get the lead out , boy . Pa , you didn't mean what you said about disowning the Finley Youth Clubs ? After what you did to the professor ? I've got to . Burning books , Halloween masks . You're just plain stupid , boy . Least you could've worn white hoods and burned a cross . - The Klan would've been blamed . - Oh , my . You better stop laughing at nothing or you'll end up in a nuthouse . Without me you wouldn't have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . - Bull . - I got you more headlines than the last campaign ... - You sure did . Once for drunk driving and once for a stag party cost me $5000 to hush it up . Nonnie . Hey , you . Yeah , you . What's Heavenly doing down on the beach alone ? Just trying to be alone , I guess . Sure you ain't arranged a meeting between her and Mr . Wayne ? - No , Tom . - But you did tell her he was back . - Yes , Tom . - Sister-in-law you got a powerful lot to answer for . You favored Chance Wayne encouraged , aided and abetted in his corruption of my baby . That boy never could ... Could never knowingly harm her . You're like your dead sister . Gullible . Hello , honey . I don't like you out here all alone . Why , Papa ? Afraid he might come along ? - Who might come along ? - Oh , Papa . - I'm concerned , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching , Papa . I'm only trying to save my baby from being hurt ever again . How ? By insisting I marry Dr . George Scudder ? And before him , a 50-year-old moneybags you needed for your business ? Me ? Sell my own flesh and blood ? More than once . Remember the Texas oil tycoon ? And the Washington wheel ? All of them rich , all of them important . Every one of them had a powerful feeling for you . There was a time when you could've saved me , Papa by letting me marry Chance , when we were both young and clean . If he loved you so much , why 'd he run off in the first place ? You told him he wasn't good enough . You drove him away to compete with all those big shots . - The point is , he went . - Yes , and he tried . Oh , how he tried . And when the right doors wouldn't open he went in the wrong one's . Oh , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not when I need you . For what , Papa ? What are you planning to use me for now ? Why , honey , ever since your angel mama was took away from me you and your brother are all I got in the world to give my love to . - That doesn't speak well for Miss Lucy . - Who is Miss Lucy ? That certainly doesn't speak well for her . I ain't never heard of no Miss Lucy . You never heard of the woman you keep in a $50-a-day suite of rooms at the Regal Palms Hotel ? That charges her clothes and beauty treatments to your account ? And you say , "" Who is Miss Lucy ? "" Well , keep your love , Papa . Just give me 10 percent of the fortune you spend on this woman you never heard of . - You keep your mouth shut . - You better tell that to Miss Lucy . - You keep your mouth shut . She doesn't speak very well of you , Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . - Who says Miss Lucy says that ? She wrote it with lipstick in the ladies ' room at the hotel bar . Wrote what ? She wrote , "" Boss Finley can't cut the mustard . "" That is a ridiculous lie . Oh , Papa . I know and everyone knows that Miss Lucy was your mistress long before Mama died . I never harmed your mother , as God is my judge . Careful , Papa . Judgment Day might be any day . You listen to me , you ungrateful , hypocritical slut . Last week , in the state capital , when I was speaking on the menace to the chastity of womanhood , a heckler almost caused a riot . You know what he hollered ? "" Hey , Boss Finley , how about your daughter ? How about her chastity ? "" An honest question , Papa . What was your honest answer ? That was my answer . You have got an illusion of power , Boss . I have power , and that is no illusion . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I won't embarrass you any more , Papa . - I'll go away . Tonight , if you like . - You're going nowhere . - You're marrying George Scudder . - No , Papa , I'm not . - We'll discuss it tomorrow . - No . - All right . - Not tomorrow , not ever . All right . Tomorrow night , you're coming to the TV rally with me , missy . You're gon na wear the white of a virgin . You're gon na wear a smile on your face . You're gon na face that crowd and TV audience with pride and defiance . - That's gon na stop all those ugly rumors . - I won't do it . Then you won't . And I'm gon na remove Chance Wayne from your life finally and for the last time . Now , sugar , how do you want him to leave St . Cloud ? In that fishtail Cadillac he come in , or in the garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is yours . Sergeant , get my car out . Did you have another attack , princess ? What was that strange noise ? - Oh , you mean the radio ? - Yes , it frightened me . Well , some more oxygen ? No . No , I must look hideous in it . No , honey . You just ... You just look exotic . Yeah , like a princess from Mars , or a big , magnified insect . Oh , thank you very much . - Well , maybe I ought to call a doctor ? - No . No , no doctors . Get me my robe . When something disturbs me , I just get a little short-winded , that's all . What is this place ? A private hospital ? And you . What are you ? Are you one of those male nurses ? I take care of you , but I'm not your nurse . But you're employed by me , is that it ? For some purpose or other ? - Yep , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , princess ? - Yes , I see . I'm used to footing the bills . Hey . Is your money there ? The jewels accounted for ? I'm looking for a pill . May I have something to wash it down with ? You're not going to give me water . Hello ? Oh , yes , Mr . Hatcher . I'm afraid I made a mistake , Mr . Wayne . Those rooms you're in , they're reserved for the TV rally . Well , I'm sorry too , Mr . Hatcher . You see , Miss Alexandra Del Lago ... - Don't use my name . ... is sound asleep . - But Miss Del Lago is in no con ... - Don't use my name . Ask him how long he intends to stay . - Well , that depends . - Hang up . Well , Mr . Hatcher , you wouldn't wan na bear the responsibility for what might happen to Miss Del Lago if she is ... I said , hang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I only used your name to stop them from evicting us . Will you please shut up ? I'm trying to forget . Forgetting . What are you trying to forget , princess ? What're you trying to hide ? You're all out of focus . Don't I have any glasses ? Where are my glasses ? Well , you had a little accident . - Oh , what was that ? - You fell flat on your face with them on . - Where 'd you put them ? - lf I was in that condition I wouldn't know where anything I had with me was . Or anything I did . By the way , did we do anything ? Mostly you've been knocking yourself out with one thing or another . Did we spend the night together ? Oh , yes , ma'am . But I did not molest you . Well , should I thank you for that or accuse you of cheating ? I like you . You are a nice monster . Well , I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't mind waking up in an intimate situation with someone but I do like to see who it is . So I can make whatever adjustment seems called for . Well . I may have done better but God knows I have done worse . Do you remember where we met ? Well , this much I do remember : That I like bodies to be silky-smooth , hard gold . - Do you remember where we met ? - No . - And the circumstances ? - No . All I remember is us driving through a town called Tallahassee . - And before that ? - That water . Is that the Pacific Ocean ? No , ma'am , that's the gulf . What gulf ? The gulf of misunderstanding between you and me . - It's not that funny . - Oh , yes , it is . That's exactly what Bennie Taubman said to me . "" Sweetie , sweetie , "" he said ... - No more gulfs between you and I . - Bennie . This comeback will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - I'm worried , Bennie . You leave the worrying to me . Excuse us for a minute . You've been a top star for 15 years . You've got millions of fans . Loyal , devoted . Devoted to the way I used to be , the way I used to look . Bennie , I am scared . - You ? Never . - Miss Del Lago ! You're a professional , an artist , a personality . Alexandra Del Lago is the sex symbol of America . - Say , Charlie , how about it ? - She's coming . - Thank you . - Playback . Get me a little something , will you ? - God , no . - What's the matter ? I remembered the thing I wanted to forget . The stupid , senseless end of my life , that's all . No wonder I didn't want to remember . I was no fool . - You want some oxygen ? - No . Where is it ? Where is the stuff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . Those pills aren't any good . It's right here . Well , that is a brilliant place to put it . Hotel maid sometimes do clean under mattresses , you know . Wouldn't that be pretty ? A year in one of those model prisons for distinguished addicts . This is pretty high-class pot . Where 'd you get it ? You beautiful , stupid young man . That is not pot . It's hashish . Moroccan , and the finest . Pop star . It's insanity . The legend of Alexandra Del Lago was ... Was youth . I was right . I told him I was right . Why ... ? Why didn't I trust my instincts ? They've stood me in good stead for many , many a year . Where does one retire to ? There is no place to retire to when you retire from the movies . No place except oblivion . One thing that'll help you forget oblivion is ... This . It's this . If I had just been old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just wasn't young . Not young . I just wasn't young anymore . Nobody's young anymore . Stars in retirement sometimes give acting lessons . They give beauty hints , they write gossip columns . Princess , just smoke . Oh , yes . Smoke . And after this the mercenary young lovers . - Like me ? - Yes , like you . Your comeback . I mean , what happened ? You just didn't have it anymore ? Oh , I had it . I had the will and I had the talent to go with it . But the camera . The camera doesn't know how to lie . The screen is a very clear mirror . There is a thing , God help us , called a close-up . Camera number one in position . Finish your candles , there , boys . Playback . The camera dollies in . And you , your head , your face are caught in the frame with the lights blazing . And all your terrible history screams while you smile . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it . I told you I want a shadow right here on her neck . You understand ? Not your fault , sweetie . You're terrific . Okay , Charlie . We go again . Right now . - Camera , number one position . - Playback . - Quiet . - All right , places , everybody . And then , before you know it , comes the night of the preview . The first part of the film , I felt so safe . - What did you say her name was ? - Alexandra Del Lago , stupe . I thought she was dead and buried . Sweetie , wait . Believe me . Please . Miss Del Lago , one more picture , please . She fell . Oh , poor thing . - She's drunk . - They're all drunks , all of them . After that , flight . Running away from that frightful comeback . I never stopped running until now . - Know what you need right now ? - Yes , to forget again . First we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we apply the magic formula . What ? Like we did in Palm Beach , remember ? That soothing , magical formula called papaya cream . Yes . Yes . Papaya-cream rubs . Were you one of those faceless young bodies in Palm Beach ? Well , that's where we met . Don't you remember , in your private cabana , on the beach ? And you were breathless . I mean , just like you are right now . It was painful . Painful to see . And you were the anesthetic that eased my pain . Yeah , and you were smoking . Just like you are right now . That feels so ... I don't remember your face , but your hands are familiar . There . That hash , how 'd you get hooked ? On my way to Europe , running away from my comeback . The ship's doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the States , smuggle it ? Know another way ? You mean you smuggled it right past customs , princess ? What are you trying to prove ? Nothing . No , I just ... Don't forget , you're the one that introduced me to this fine old Moroccan hash . Boy , I doubt very much if I have any vice old or new , that I could introduce to you . - Ma'am , don't call me boy . - You knew all about this stuff , Carl . - My name is not Carl , it's Chance . - You called yourself Carl in Palm Beach . I always carry an extra name in my pocket . Why , are you a criminal ? No , ma'am , not me . I mean , you're the one that's committed a federal crime . What 'd you do that for ? I thought you might've planted someone outside the door . Don't you trust me ? Who taught you to rub desperate ladies the right way ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Well , more or less . - How much more ? Ma'am , if we 'd made love , you 'd have remembered it . Well , what stopped you ? Certainly not I . And certainly not your ethics . What's the angle ? Why did you hold out ? I held out till you signed a contract . Well , evidently I signed . Why did you still hold out ? - I wanted to hold your interest . - Well , you miscalculated . My interest always increases with satisfaction . You mean you don't intend to live up to that contract ? I can get out of that contract any time I want to . - Do you have any talent ? - For what ? Acting , baby . Acting . A contract for acting implies that you are an actor . Are you ? I've been an extra in movies long enough to know that I can be as big a star as some of them she-men that have made it . Princess . Princess ? All I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes more than one break . - Chance . Chance . Chance Wayne . - You're stoned . - Baby , there is no easy way to the top .

That's right . Princess ? You know something , honey ? That all that talk about narcotics it's been recorded on tape . - Where did you get that thing ? - You bought it for me in Palm Beach . To improve my diction . - comeback . The ship ' s doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish came later . In Tangier . - Blackmail , is it ? - That's very ugly language . The language of the gutter is understood by anyone who ever fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to this contract . - And that's not all . - Money ? - And if I refuse ? - Well , you won't . You wouldn't want the FBI to get ahold of these recordings . - Chance . - Or the newspapers and those bigshot columnists ? And the dirt magazines ? Princess , you got a big name to protect . You still got a reputation . I had , baby , I had . I have been blackmailed by experts . I hate to think what desperation has made you think that you can try to intimidate me . Me , Alexandra Del Lago , with this ridiculous ... Oh , Chance , it's silly . It's so silly , it's touching . It's downright endearing . Makes me feel close to you . Now , I got ta see somebody . I want some cash and I want your car . Here . Here . Now , you 'd better start signing these traveler's checks , or I'll ... Or what ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When monster meets monster , one monster has to give way and it will never be me . Now , then , signed checks are payment . Delivery comes first .

In the morning , we'll talk about what you want and what you need . Aren't you ashamed a little ? Yes . Aren't you ? More than a little . Close the curtains , please . Then come here to me . And make me almost believe that we are a pair of young lovers without any shame . Two things , Pa . First , he's bedding in with a broken-down old movie star , Alexandra Del Lago . But she's still famous and capable of causing us trouble ... Second , Mr . Wayne don't show any inclination to move on . I told him she's not well enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every newspaper's gon na be down here . But if we separate Mr . Wayne from his lady we could proceed more directly , if it was necessary . Right , sir . You're the doctor , call an ambulance . - Haul queenie to the hospital . - Without her permission ? Say she's contagious . Bubonic plague , typhoid fever . - I'm not gon na let you involve me in this . - Lower your voice . - He's not gon na involve me in this ... - Doctor , laddie you are already involved right up to your scrofulous chicken neck . I've done anything you ever asked me . Anything . But one public mistake , one slip , and we ... Laddie , you've got all the symptoms of a nervous breakdown . Now , my prescription for you is a weekend vacation . A change of scenery to build up your backbone . I 'd say you're sickly . Critical . Might be even terminal . So you 'd better leave quick . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Yes , sir . - Happy Easter , Fly . - Thank you , sir . - Happy Easter . - Thank you , governor . - Shall I ring her , say you're coming up ? - No . Lucy ? Lucy ?

Shut that damn thing off . I said , shut it ... ! My , my , my . Ain't we in a mood . Guess what I got for you , for an Easter present . I went all the way to New Orleans for it . Close your eyes , lover . This is a mighty exciting surprise . Don't look . Like ? Is that for me ? Well , I surely don't intend to give it to anybody else . Oh , feast your tired old eyes , daddy doll . I sure do hope that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . For me ? You'll spoil me yet , honey . Oh , why , it's lovely . It's a lovely Easter egg . Am I supposed to eat it ? Open the top . It sure takes a powerful kind of rooster to lay this kind of egg . Oh , darling , you shouldn't have . Why not ? You deserve everything you get . Oh , I'm so nervous . Like it , sugar baby ? It's absolutely divine . It's heavenly . That's better . Now you go downstairs to the ladies ' room of the cocktail lounge and you write on the toilet mirror with this same lipstick : "" Miss Lucy is available to any punk's got $5 and can cut the mustard . "" You know , I don't very much like my Easter surprise . Hello ? Operator , did you get the Finley residence yet ? Aunt Nonnie ? Well , can you talk now ? Well , can I see you , then ? Well , I can ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll meet you there . Aunt Nonnie , whatever it is that happened , I can explain . And listen I got it made . No , I really got it made . All right . Princess ? Princess ? Pure , hard gold , all right . Yeah . Well , I'm glad you're appreciative but , you know , I'm going out pretty soon and my credit is kind of shaky . I would like to smoke , please . No , no . Just one of the ordinary cigarettes that only give you cancer . What are those lovely bells ? Why , madam , it is Easter Sunday . How fitting . I feel absolutely reborn . Yes . The world and I are on very good terms this morning . Yeah , well , we made a little bargain last night , remember ? Oh , yes . Well , I will live up to my end of the bargain after I have put on my face . The face I face the world with , baby . Will you open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'re afraid of ? Oh , no , ma'am . The thing I want most in the world is out there . This town belonged to me once . And will again . Were you born here ? - On the wrong side of the tracks , but ... - Well , most of us were , baby . You know , the set that I ran with was a snob set . You know , they had family , big names , big money . - All I had was ... - Beauty . Say it . What you had was beauty . I had it , and I say it with pride . Yeah . Well , the others were born satisfied . Well , I had to get something better . And I did . I got it . While my friends were doing the conventional things like flunking out of state university I appeared in the biggest stage hit on Broadway . I had my picture on the cover of LIFE magazine . And , at the same time I was employing my other talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever truly meant for . I've wallowed in a social register of New York with discreet wives in the millionaire set and debutante daughters in the horsy set . Did they foot the bills too ? Yeah . But I always gave them much more than I took . To older women , I gave back a feeling of excitement and youth . To sad , lost women a merciful display of affection and temporary hope . Eccentrics ? Understanding , tolerance . You must have been quite a successful enterprise . - Oh , I was going places . - Where ? Successville . My name was appearing in columns I was promised this part in a big Broadway play Hollywood was nibbling . I was getting to be somebody . Then it was time for me to come home for my girl take her away with me , like I promised . And when I came home , oh , man . This town just buzzed with excitement . Chance . She never asked about the others . Well , she didn ' t have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done to could ever cancel out our love , the pleasure we gave each other . You know , the big difference between people is not between rich and poor or good and evil . The biggest of all differences between people is between those that have had pleasure in love and those that haven't . We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from Washington . It was officially announced that United States ground forces entered the Korean War today . President Truman termed the intervention a police action . And I am positive there's no finer , no braver , no more patriotic man to lead our Dixie Regiment than our own hometown boy Chance Wayne . Congratulations . All I could think was , "" This stops everything . "" Just when things were going great the end . Period . Even if I was lucky , I 'd have to start all over again . You and a few million others . Their jobs would be waiting for them , but my trade was youth . And war either makes you age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of hopes and dreams and ambitions being wiped out by a 2-ounce accident like a bullet . A bullet shot off into space by anybody . And my head and that bullet at the same place at the same time . Only , it wasn't a bullet that got me , it was my nerves . A month in a hospital , a medical discharge . And when I came home that time , there was no parties , no banners no picture in the newspaper . - So you ran away again . - Yeah . And I finally made it to Hollywood . And failed again . That time . But not this time . Princess . Now , I've got a few things to iron out right now . But tonight you give this big press conference , see ? You know , to tell the world about this new discovery you signed up . The last thing I want is publicity . I know , but this will prove that young talent is your real interest in life . Which it certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is me , Alexandra Del Lago . Besides , a movie starring our special talent would be banned in all 50 states , censored worldwide . Princess , I am taking your car . - Well , when will I see you ? - Wait here . I don't like waiting for anybody . Baby . Morning , Miss Finley . What is it , sergeant ? Nothing , miss . Just sort of spying ? No , ma'am . Just sort of watching over you . Easter must be a very dangerous time . Guess so , miss . - The ladies ready for church ? - Miss Nonnie's already gone , sir . - She took a taxi . - I see . - She get any calls this morning ? - The phone rang . She talked to somebody . No , sir , Mr . Finley . I don't know who to . Get my Bible . Good morning . Nice morning , Mr . Finley . Thank you , laddie . You look mighty sweet , sugar . I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like you to behave like a daughter should . Well , did you meditate on Mr . Wayne's future ? At the present , he is enjoying life in the loving arms of a famous Hollywood siren . Hey , Pa , if Chance is living with a real princess does that make him royalty too ? It makes him what he always was : A criminal degenerate and parasite . Oh , I see . Chance ? She never blamed you for anything . She always had ... Nothing . I gave her nothing , Aunt Nonnie . She lived lonely and she died lonely . Gee , I'm glad to see you . I came here to tell you one thing . Well , I was sort of hoping that you 'd bring Heavenly . Go away before it's too late . Before her father ... Why won't they let me see her , Aunt Nonnie ? Because she and George ... ? - I can't talk about it . - Why ? Why ? Now , why , Aunt Nonnie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please help me , Aunt Nonnie . You were always able to ... See , you were like a mother to me . You always called me son . Why did you stop calling me son ? Oh , Chance , go away before it's too late . I am not leaving here till I talk to Heavenly or see her . Now , you tell her that . Aunt Nonnie , I got a right . Goodbye , son . Aunt Nonnie . - Aunt Nonnie , I'm taking you to church . - No , Chance . I'm afraid . Afraid for you . Take your sister on in . - Happy Easter . - Happy Easter , mayor . Well , look here . Glad to see you , laddie . Hold it , Mr . Finley . Thank you , sir . It's no use , Mr . Finley , I ... Laddie , I hear you're consorting with a genuine princess . Guess that sort of makes you a prince , don't it ? Happy Easter , Mrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finley . I once had a dog called Prince . I had to butcher him to keep all the bitches in town from being violated . Deacon , I'm counting on your support at the rally . - Up , the rebels ! - Let's see , now . - When did you last visit us ? - Why won't you let me see her , sir ? I remember , you hit town last time in a freight car . You saw my daughter then and you left her carrying your bastard then too . Let you see her ? Sure , prince , when I've had you taken care of like my dog . I remember , you hit town last time in a freight car . No , I'll get you dirty . Hold me . Just hold me . Hold me . What are you thinking ? I was just ... I was just feeling kind of peaceful and easy listening to those freewheeling birds coming home . If we could just be like one of them out there , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free or even wants to be . You know what I was thinking ? About those five days and nights on those freight cars . Thinking that , "" Heavenly will make me feel clean again . She'll wash away all the ... "" What's it like in movie land ? Oh , it is like no place in this world , baby . In fact , it's not even a place , it's a state of mind with a stone wall around it a mile high . "" Strange birds , keep out . "" No , it's the strange one's that get in . I know . Why , I've been clawing away at that wall for over a year now , trying to get on the inside . This last year's been ... - Wasted ? - No . No , just a run of bad breaks , back-to-back . Nothing's wasted that teaches you how to operate , how to beat the game . Last year's the best investment I ever made . Oh , next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m gon na take you with me right through that stone wall , first class , straight to the top . Again , Chance ? I got the key now , baby . I got the know-how .

It's gon na carry me all the way . And then before you know it , before you know it I'm gon na have that brass ring , that lucky brass ring right here . - Which gets you what ? - It gets you the prize honey , money , success , happiness . No . All the brass ring gets you is a free ride on a wooden horse that's going nowhere except up and down and round and round . My papa sold you that phony dream and you're still buying it . How does he say it ? "" All you need is one lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the jackpot . "" Anyone can be a millionaire , so everybody's got to try it . That's right . And why not ? There are a lot of ways you can make it , and for me there is one quick way . Now , just stick with me , baby , and when I come back next time ... - Another next time . - No , this time I got a job . I got a big job in Palm Beach mixing with all kinds of important people . Take me with you . Please . No , I can't , baby . Not yet . You know , in this job , I got ta travel fast .

I know exactly the kind of gold-plated hell I'm going to . But you , you have gone past something you couldn't afford to go past . Your time , your youth . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you've had it ! Look who's talking . Just look at yourself . What do you see in there ? I see me . Alexandra Del Lago , artist and star . Now you look at yourself . What do you see ? What ? A nameless face , that's what you see . Oh , I remember faces like yours . I remember young men with dreams like yours . I remember their eyes , I remember their voices I remember their smiles , I remember their bodies . But their names , their names have gone . They're just nameless bodies . Well , you remind me of one in particular . What was his name ? Franz something . Franz , Franz ... - Albertzart . Yes , Franz Albertzart . - Are you through ? Have you finished ? I saw Franz a few years later in Monte Carlo . He was with a woman of 70 , and his eyes were older than hers . But she held him . She led him by an invisible chain through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedient lap dog . Chance Wayne is Franz Albertzart . Oh , no . Look , I'm not Franz anybody . Princess , I'm your next leading man . Princess , now , look , you've got ta open the right doors for me . I know you're gon na do this for me . I have been knocking on those doors of success till my insides are bloody . That's how I've been knocking on those doors , with my bare insides . You will open only one door : The door to my car as my chauffeur . You will wake me in the morning as my butler or my lover , depending on what I want . In a few years , you will be through with your good looks and I will be through with you . And that is the truth . Can you face the truth ? Are you ready to be my chauffeur ? My next Franz Albertzart ? Oh , don't you know I would die first ? I would . I would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Lord protect him . Our Tom . I am here to answer charges against my good name and character . Thirty years ago , the voice of God told me to save this sweet land from pollution . Well , I am here on the same sacred mission tonight . To save us from outsiders who wan na corrupt our way of life . Boss Finley ! Hey , Boss Finley ! What way of life you talking about ? You mean the way your daughter ... The way your virtuous Miss Heavenly had a secret operation at the hands of Dr . Scudder ? - What are you waiting for ? An illegal operation , performed in your hospital . Aided and abetted by you . - And forced on her without her consent . - That is a dirty , black lie ! - Did God tell you how to rob us blind ? - Show yourself ! - Listen to me , folks ! - How to use your office for gain ? - Listen to me ! - Come on , get him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and country . My life is an open book . Listen to me , folks ! Folks , listen to me ! Chance , we're leaving . Right now . Together . Murderer ! Baby killer ! I'm going to send a boy up for my luggage . You had better come down with my luggage . - I am not part of your luggage . - Chance . Whatever I am , I am not part of your luggage . All right . You know what's going to happen to you if you stay . Goodbye . Chance . Chance , dear , I ... Well , it's ... - You forget something , princess ? - Well , yes . Yes , I did . - These , maybe ? - Oh , yes . Of course , last night they were worthless but now , after my comeback you know , they're worth a small jackpot . - In cash . - On the house . Chance . Please , let me help you . - Goodbye , lover . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good luck . - I'll wait for you in the car . Princess , each of us has his own private hell to go to . - Find your sister . - Take it easy , Pa . She'll run off with that punk . - No , he's gone . Checked out . - That won't stop her . Will you let me handle this ? Mr . Finley . How would you answer the charges ... ? I am shocked , shocked , to find our state overrun by backstabbing Bolsheviki and Red rabble-rousers . Get the governor on the phone . Are you aware it was the Finley Youth Club hoodlums that started that riot ? What riot ? I'm only aware that decent Americans were defending freedom of speech which I have yet to receive the benefit of . Oh , Miss Finley , would you care to make a statement ? - Miss Finley ? - Hasn't enough been said already ? Sure , Aunt Nonnie , folks will think we got something to hide . Sugar ? Heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You came here of your own free will and I hereby give you just as much freedom to speak your piece , right now . Take me home , Papa . Good night , folks . Good night , you-all . Heavenly ! Heavenly ! Mr . Chance , it's me , Charles . Don't stay here , Mr . Chance . Don't ! Don't stay here . Please , Mr . Chance , don't stay here now . Heavenly ! Well , lookie here . Thought you 'd be halfway to California by now with that tramp actress of yours . Heavenly ! Don't you ever speak the name of my sister again . Heavenly ... Heavenly ! - Don't you know ? - Kill him . No . Just gon na take away lover-boy's meal ticket . Put him down there . Chance ? Chance . Bring him over here . Look at yourself . No woman will ever again pay to love that . - Chance ? - Go in the house . Hello ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor calling . - Chance ? - Hello , governor . How's the family ? - Fine , fine . - Night , Aunt Nonnie . Oh , baby , what did we do to you ? Don't cry . Don't cry , baby . It's all right . It's all right . What you heard was lies . Just lies . The press will be here in a moment . I want you here with me to answer questions . He sure busted up that dream of mine . We're leaving . We're leaving here right now . My daughter will be here to answer any and all questions . Heavenly ! Get in the house ! Go . Papa , I'm never coming into that house again . Wait . Hold it , governor . I'll call you back . Come back here ! Come back ! - Nonnie , she can't leave here . Not now . - Why ? - Me . What about me ? - You ? You can go straight to hell . @ @ @ @ @ @

Oui , oui . Et pensez-vous que la campagne est plus tranquille que la ville ? Par exemple . Oui , mais pas assez excitante . - Uh , quand j'ai venu ici ... - Quand je suis venue . Oh , gosh . How many times have I made that mistake ? It's common among my pupils . It's what they most often get wrong . Oh , what's the difference ? If and when I ever get to visit Paris again , I'll have long forgotten all my French . - I must be going . - No ! Stay . It's still early . - I mean , what are you gon na do at home ? - Nothing special . Right . I mean , how many times can you putter around the garden ? God ! I can't believe my mother . She's out there ... She's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write her biography . Her stupid life . "" As told to . "" Oh , come on , now . She'll be gone in a couple of days . Yeah , that's what you said last week . Time passes and she's still here . Oh , look at this . She will not stop picking the flowers , which I asked her not to do . She doesn't even put them in water , so of course they die . Walking around in a snit is not gon na make the time go any faster . When I ask Peter if he wants to go for a drive or walk , he's busy writing his novel . But he's got plenty of time to stroll around the lake with her . - You must admit she tells funny stories . - See ? Men . She certainly hasn't lost her knack . - Somehow I thought Peter 'd be different . - Lane , it's your mother . - Is that when you dated Errol Flynn ? - Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , I met him when I was 16 . For Errol , 15 was over the hill . Lane , I invited the Richmonds for drinks tonight . I thought we might have a party . What did you do that for ? Peter and I were supposed to see the new Kurosawa film . - Sorry . Why didn't you say something ? - I did . That's OK . We can catch it another night . OK , but it's only there tonight . - Where was I ? - How we met . Oh ! It was like a bad movie . We both hailed the same taxicab . - We shared a cab and fell in love . - And I know nothing about physics . - So what did you talk about ? - Talk ? By the time the meter hit $3 ... - .. she had her tongue in my ear . - Oh ! Lloyd ! How nice . I drop in to visit my daughter and she has a writer renting her cottage . I'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure-fire bestseller . I know . I remember reading about your exploits in the paper . You're too young , but anything , whatever your dad read , it's all true . No , I remember your picture in the long defunct New York Journal-American ... .. with an actor named Jeff Chandler , who you dated . What a memory . What a memory ! That was Palm Beach ! I love Palm Beach ! That's where Lloyd and I were heading when I decided to stop off to see Lane . Um ... I hadn't seen her , you know , since she ... took the pills . God , that had to be six , eight months ago . Boy , what some people will do for love . Or the lack of it . Of course , I understand . I mean , if you've never had something ... .. and then you experience it and then it's taken away ... Wow . Poor kid . Try and stroke the ball to the rhythm of the music . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the music's so fast . - Keep it rhythmic , and keep your eye ... Steffie , Mrs Mason thinks she's got me an offer on the house . That's great . Congratulations . Two . Not great . But , after everything's paid off , ... .. there 'd be something to put a down payment on an apartment in New York . I can get two for mine , and it's half your acreage . Well , I can't really afford to be choosy . At least I have a customer . I think . I hope , at least . Don't give it away . I can lend you what you need . No , Howard . Oh , God , no . Thank you , though . No . You've been ... You've been incredible to me through all this , ... - .. but I've got ta try and get my own life ... - What can you do in New York ? I don't know . I ... Maybe my photography again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I don't know . It's awful , isn't it , at my age to be floundering around so ? I just ... I don't know what I want . A child . I 'd love to have a child . Lane , did you , by any chance , finish those chapters I gave you ? - Yeah , almost . They're wonderful . - I thought about them . I'm discouraged . - You shouldn't be . You're wrong . - I just wan na start over , again . You can't tear up everything you write , you know . Otherwise of course you have to take tranquillisers to calm down . It seems so futile . I was supposed to be finished by now . Next week is Labor Day . I have to be back at my job the day after . If you wouldn't let my mother seduce you ... Now , her life would make a fascinating book . Why ? What's so fascinating about her frivolous existence ? That she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... .. for a gangster who beat her up ? You think that's compelling ? Was it the shooting ? That wasn't fascinating . That was pathetic . Maybe it's that she's a survivor , and the book I'm writing is about surviving . You're right . She went on with her life , but I get stuck with the nightmares . Excuse me . Uh ... Diane wanted some ice cubes and you seem to be out . Um , there's a ... there's an ice machine just outside the back door . And you're wrong to think your mother didn't suffer terribly over that whole affair . Right . Poor thing She experienced a little hearing loss in her left ear from the gunshot . Noise trauma . The only point I wanted to make - and I didn't mean to upset you - .. is that some people are survivors and some let life's tragedies annihilate them . - This is just one of the cruelties of living . - And in your book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who kills her mother's lover is ... sleazy . And the trial was sleazy and he was sleazy . And my mother was completely unconcerned . I'm sorry . I'm sorry . I'll get you those pages . And they're good , you know , despite what you think . I won't let you tear them up . - Very good . I'm very impressed . - You liked that ? Oh ! I didn't know you were a pool player . Now you know . Did you ever get a chance to play that record I got you ? Yeah . Yeah , I did . I play it all the time . It's so beautiful . I was just listening to it last night . Somehow I knew you 'd like it . Did I hear you say your book was about survival ? Yeah , well , it's not really about survival . It's about , you know . It's about everything . Oh , really ? Like the Encyclopaedia Britannica . Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard , it's so unlike you to be rude . We don't need another book on survival . We already have the Boy Scout manual . Lane says he's talented . Well , if he's such a hotshot , why's he wasting his life on Madison Avenue ? It's because writing beer and deodorant ads is more within his grasp . I'm surprised at you . You're the kindest man , ... .. and you can't bring yourself to say one good word about Peter . He's OK . I don't mean he's a bad person . But I can't stand that Lane gets so moonstruck over his line . - I mean , she blushes when he's around . - Now you sound jealous . What's the difference ? She's going away anyhow . I knew that was bothering you . If you could have seen her at the beginning of the year when she came up . She was in such bad shape . She needed someone to take care of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend long afternoons together , ... .. winter evenings listening to music . It was such a pleasure watching her gain strength and begin to enjoy things more . I remember one night I was home alone after we 'd seen a movie together ... .. and I noticed that I missed her and I couldn't wait to see her the next day . And that's when I realised I never wanted her to leave here . - Oh , Howard . - Thank you . I never said anything . I knew she was through a terrible time and not over it . I didn't think she was ready to hear that someone had become ... .. dependent on her . I didn't want to ... I didn't want to say anything that would frighten her or cause her any confusion . Well , after all , I am much older than she is . So in the end I hedged and procrastinated and ... obsessed over her . And over the right moment to speak . Next thing I knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who suddenly started occupying all her time . Well , ... .. one can see how having Peter on the premises , just ... - - .. just the two of them for seven weeks , ... .. how she could fall very much in love . Never thought I could feel this way after Karen died . Hello ? Steffie ! It's your husband . He says it's important . Lane's changed towards me . She used to get such a kick out of me . She used to laugh at my jokes and tell me how pretty I looked . She's become so angry . What do you think , honey ? This or the pink one , with the jacket ? - This one . - You're the boss . Hey . Hey ! Come here . Where you goin ' , huh ? Boy , oh boy ! Am I lucky I hailed that taxi ! You're the only man I've known worth marrying since Lane's father . The others were just nothin ' ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to marry ' em , I said no . - I'm the lucky one . - You , lucky ? You inherited a machine that's grinding to a halt . Between my ulcers and my gall bladder and my angina ... The whole is greater than the sum of the parts . Remember ? Hm ? Said the bishop to the showgirl . - Sorry . - No , come in . - You wanted to borrow this pin ? - Oh , yeah . But I've decided on a whole other outfit so I don't think I'll need it . - It's lovely . Where 'd you get it ? - You gave it to me . I did ? What taste ! - Doesn't Diane look stunning ? - She looks great . Try to have a good time tonight . You don't wan na turn into a recluse . I just really didn't feel up to having people over tonight . You have to learn to put the past behind you . What's done is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to go to the movies with Peter . Is he a good writer ? I mean , seriously , could he write my biography ? - Oh , Mom , don't be foolish . - Foolish ? I've been offered good money . Peter's trying to write a serious book . You shouldn't be distracting him . God , he's always asking me millions of questions . I don't think your memoirs are something you wan na make public . Really ? I'm not ashamed of my life . Your mother was offered quite an advance . Then she should find somebody else to write it . And leave me and Dad out of it . I can't leave you out of it . That's the part everybody's interested in . You're exploiting an ugly situation . You've become so touchy lately . I mean , if your life hasn't worked out , stop blaming me for it . Take the bull by the horns . Make something happen . I'm sorry . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have remarkable energy . You were such a promising young girl , so bright , and you had my looks . Well , you had better bone structure than I did , but you lacked my height . And you had your father's intelligence . You got ta do something about all that . I mean , you're young , you're lovely . Of course , you dress like a Polish refugee . I don't feel too attractive these days . Peter thinks you're beautiful . And he's right . - Does he ? - He sings your praises . He's probably just being polite . You really like him , don't you ? - I don't know . - You've got ta be a little cool about it . - You shouldn't let your desperation show . - I don't think I have . I always felt there was a fatal element of hunger in your last affair . That's not true . I don't think Jeff would have run quite so quickly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain pressure . I sensed it . His name was Jack . And you were never here , so you don't know what happened . Darling , don't be so defensive . I base this observation on the time I saw you together . And I'm not saying anything different than those high-priced psychiatrists have said . When it comes to men , you're probably doing something to stand in your way . - I probably am . - Yeah . Well , this is out . Looks like I'm going to a luau ! Oh , my God . Look at me . I got ta redo my whole make-up . It's hell , gettin ' older . Especially when you feel 21 inside . All the strengths that sustain you all through your life ... .. just vanish one by one . And you study your face in the mirror and you ... You notice something is missing . And then you realise it's your future . So that's ... That's why I want you to find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . - Hi . - Hi . - I guess I'm early . - The guests haven't arrived yet . Well , you look wonderful , all dressed up . It's starting to rain . Maybe it'll cool things off . Let's hope . Well , you look lovely . I said that ! Thank you . - Did you know the , um ... - Steffie ... - Sorry . What were you gon na say ? - No . What ? - You looked like you were ... - No , nothing . Thunder's getting close . Yeah . So , who's the history professor ? The history professor ? How did you know about that ? Did we talk about that ? Well , you mentioned to me one time that that might be the title of your book . The history professor was my father . He taught at a college in Connecticut and he ... .. he was fired during the McCarthy era . He was blacklisted . He had to do all kinds of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by playing poker and betting the horses . He sounds wonderful . Yeah , he was . I see what you mean by a survivor . This summer went by too fast . I had such high hopes for this book . To tell you the truth , I'm floundering . Is this the first time you've tried to write a book ? Oh , I've published a couple of short stories . Nothing ... Nothing any good . I've never been able to do it full time . I've always been busy with other obligations . You don't want to hear about all this . You know , Lane showed me some of your short stories and ... .. I thought they were wonderful . It's funny . I've wanted to talk to you so often , ... .. but we never seem to be alone . We were alone . We were alone for a whole afternoon . Running into you at the local flea market is not exactly private . Well , we walked around together . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? Well , I felt awkward . At least you liked the record I found you so it wasn't a complete waste of time . It's so funny because I used to be in love with a boy who just idolised Art Tatum . Well , this was years ago on my first visit to Paris . He was a student and he played piano in a jazz club in the student quarter . He didn't speak any English . And we spent a summer trying to make each other understand our feelings . The funny thing was it didn't matter that we only knew a few words . Oh , anyway , that was years ago . I hate thunder . I don't care how harmless it is , I wan na get under the bed ! - The air is full of electricity . - I'm serious ! - Where is everyone ? I heard voices . - Hi . - How do I look ? Don't say "" old and fat "" . - Great . Great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let's get some more lights on . Did Lane make any hors d'oeuvres ? What were you two doing before we came down ? Excuse me ? What ? I hope you weren't out on the porch . That lightning's getting close . - Oh , no . - No . - Let's have some music . - All right . Who wants what ? - Well , you know about me . Peter ? - Vodka . - Stephanie , what do you want ? - Vodka , please . Have you given any more thought about my memoirs ? They deserve better than me . They're too good to waste on a fledgling writer . You're patronising me . - Lane says you think my life is trivial . - I never said that . - Lloyd , come on , dance with me . - Oh , honey , I'm such a stiff . If you can figure out the universe , you can figure out the box step . All right . See , there ? You're terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to say to you . Oh , well , it's , you know ... There are people coming over and people here , so ... - I don't wan na be pushy . - No , you're not pushy . I wish you 'd been here for the whole summer . Yeah , well , I couldn't . I have obligations , too , so ... What is that record ? It's terrific ! It's Art Tatum and Ben Webster . - It's funny . - What ? I made a complete fool out of myself when I met you . - No ! You didn't . - I remember carrying on at great length ... .. about writing and metaphor and choice . - I left no clich� ? unturned . - No . Actually I just ... No , I ... I just thought you were so sweet . You reminded me of Paul , the boy that I knew in Paris . - Really ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - Well , I'm very flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster ? Art Tatum's the piano . See , and I always felt foolish all the time because ... - Why ? - .. I was very taken with you right off . I love all the music from that era . You don't have any Benny Goodman , do you ? Uh , not here . Or Coon-Sanders Nighthawks ? - Now , please don't panic when I say this . - No . I just think that you're incredibly lovely . Peter , don't . Don't , please . Let's just stop this before it's too late . You know , I can't . I just ... I just feel flushed and ... and my heart is pounding . - - Oh , there are the Richmonds . Get it , will you , Lloyd ? - Oh , Howard ! - Oh , it's pouring out there . We were expecting the Richmonds . Let me get you a drink . Hi , Howard . Hi . Oh , the Richmonds must be stuck . You're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Ouija board ! Look ! They take too long . What you want is a computerised Ouija board . That way you can punch up any dead person you wan na talk to . - Howard , you did say Scotch ? - Ask Lane to dance with you . - Me ? - Mm-hm . She'll be thrilled . - She's got a big crush on you . - I don't dance . That's what everybody says . Come on . She's been so blue . - Lane ? - Yes ? Go ahead . Go ahead ! Uh , Lane , uh , Peter was just asking me ... .. if I 'd ask you to dance with him . Oh ! No , thank you . Oh , yes , thank you . That music is fabulous ! I used to go to Harlem to hear music like that . I was dating a disc jockey . He used to call records "" sides "" . - - I have two left feet . I'll get that . I'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bothering you ? - No , not at all . - I like her energy . - It's the record you got at the flea market . - I didn't know you liked jazz . - You like Prokofiev . Yeah , but not to dance to . The Richmonds aren't coming . Their house is flooded . Really ? Then maybe we can go to the Kurosawa film . - In this storm ? - Well , you know , maybe . Let's not let it kill our evening . The Richmonds aren't coming . We're lucky . They're so boring ! - Then why did you invite them ? - Uh-oh . Oh , God ! - This could last for hours . - Lloyd . - Just light some candles . - OK . I'll get some matches . I love walking around in the pitch-black . I think I put my hand in the guacamole . Lloyd ! The Richmonds are flooded , the electricity's gone off . God is testing us and I , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vodka ? O . M . I don't know any Toms . Oh , wait a minute . Are you that dentist in Hackensack that tried to rape me when I was 15 ? No ? OK . OK . One more try . Ooh , I . C . Oh , God . Nick . Wait a minute . Are you in this room ? Is your ghost in this room , bullet hole an ' all ? You were so bad . But so gorgeous . Do you still comb your hair like you were in Sicily ? Well , we had some good times . It was hectic . It was dangerous . And then it ended . I think it's clearing up . Yeah ? Please don't move away from here . I have to . You know , I should never drink . My head really spins . How are you gon na drive home ? Same way I always do : .. thinking about you . You know , in all the time I've known you I don't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the year after my wife died I was never sober . Of course , on the faculty of the school where I work , it's ... hard to tell . I'm gon na miss you so much . I'm gon na miss you , too , ... .. but we'll always stay in touch . You know what I'm saying . Howard , please . I have to ... When you got that offer today to sell the house , I ... .. I realised suddenly ... .. we wouldn't be sharing those winter evenings again . Yeah , but you knew I was only up here to get well , and not permanently . Is the difference in our ages awkward for you ? I'm in love with Peter . Isn't that the most ridiculous thing ? Considering I don't think I even have a chance with him . I did for a while . I keep telling myself that maybe it'll still work out all right somehow . And why Peter and not you ? No reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch you . Please . Please , don't . Now that I've embarrassed us both ... Let me make you some coffee . You're gon na have a terrible hangover tomorrow . I don't play this game that well in the light , let alone the dark . Look how much it's cleared up . You can see a billion stars . It should be nice tomorrow . So tell me , ... .. is it true you worked on the atomic bomb ? No . Did Diane tell you that ? Yes . Not at all . I did one small , unrelated project at Los Alamos many years ago . But when she's describing me to people I'm the father of the A-bomb . What branch of physics are you involved with ? Something much more terrifying than blowing up the planet . Really ? Is there anything more terrifying than the destruction of the world ? Yeah . The knowledge that it doesn't matter one way or the other . That it's all random . Originating aimlessly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm not talking about the world . I'm talking about the universe . All space , all time , just ... .. a temporary convulsion . And I get paid to prove it . You feel sure of that , when you look out on a night like tonight ... .. and see all those millions of stars ? That none of it matters ? I think it's just as beautiful as you do . And vaguely evocative of some deep truth that always just keeps slipping away . But then my professional perspective overcomes me , ... .. a less wishful , more penetrating view of it , ... .. and I understand it for what it truly is . Haphazard , ... .. morally neutral ... .. and unimaginably violent . Look , we shouldn't have this conversation . I have to sleep alone tonight . That's why I cling to Diane ... .. and consider myself very lucky . She's warm and vital and holds me while I sleep . That way I don't have to dream of photons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your daughter hates me . Our daughter ... .. hates me , and I love her . She's my one child , ... .. and I want her to be happy . She never got over the shooting , you know . See , now , I'm a tough cookie . I can file and forget . Rap once if you hear me , Richard . I want her to forgive me . So you speak to her . OK , Richard ? You two were so close . She loved you so much . You rap if you hear me , Richard . Rap , Richard . Rap once . Rap . I love those old songs . Between the music , the candlelight and the drinks , ... .. it feels like we're in some exotic place . Mm . I should never drink . My head swims . What are you doing ? I've wanted to touch your face since the first time we met . What do you want me to say to you ? Soon we'll be going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible . Lane is my best friend . She's crazy about you . I don't think I could ever do that . - And she's become so attached to you . - Please . I already feel guilty enough because I led her on . Not on purpose . I just wasn't thinking about anyone but myself . She's told me about all the time you spent together . I know about all your walks and talks by the lake , under the stars . She's told me all that . I felt very lonely . I needed some company , and my marriage broke up . I was losing confidence that I could write this book . I needed a voice to keep me from panicking . But you made love together . I didn't understand how vulnerable she was until it was too late . I know it's my fault . Would you ... Would you have become serious about her if I hadn't come along ? I don't know . Maybe . You do funny things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm married . You know , my kids come home from camp in a week . I have a life . I know . But is it the life you want ? Is it ? - You've been flirting with me for weeks . - Please , just go away . My husband's a wonderful man . Oh , he's bewildered because I wanted this summer apart . He's a radiologist . He takes X-rays , but ... .. I never let him take them of me because , if he looked inside , he 'd ... .. he 'd see things that he wouldn't understand and he 'd be terribly hurt . Somewhere along the line I just ... .. I just started going through the motions of my life . Steffie ... I've just ... I've just longed so to hear certain things said to me again . I want so much to respond , but I can only run . - Don't run . - I can only run . That's all I can do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn't look at you when you were around because I felt so guilty . I wan na kiss you right now . You can't . You can't because there's too many problems . This is just out of the question . Out of the question . We're gon na be discovered . Just please go away . It's out of the question . Time for me to go home . Sorry about the Kurosawa film . I made some coffee before . D' you want me to heat it up for you ? No , thanks . I 'd rather stay drunk . Maybe you 'd better . I'm supposed to work tomorrow . You've been in such a strange mood all night . Did you know that the universe was haphazard , morally neutral ... .. and unimaginably violent ? Peter ... What happened to us ? What do you mean ? You know , we were getting so close ... .. and we ... we shared all that time ... .. and , um ... .. and that night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I misreading the signs ? Maybe you did . I can't let myself get involved right now . I'm gun-shy from my marriage and ... .. I'm unsettled about my life , my work . Can I help ? They're my problems . I don't wan na cause you any suffering . You're doing so well . You need to think about yourfuture . Yeah , I know . I know you're right . I ... It's silly , but I just ... You know , I have these dreams that , when we're both in New York , ... .. you know , we 'd ... I don't know . You know , we just ... We feel things so similarly so much of the time , ... .. and that's so rare . I don't ... I'm sorry , I'm really tired . I don't know what I'm saying . The funny thing is that I'll probably wind up calling you at 3am in New York ... .. to keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I give you a hand there ? - No , that's OK . Listen , I had a talk with Peter . And he doesn't wan na get involved right now . And that's OK . I understand that . He's ... You know , he's got a lot of problems . But I ... But maybe things will be different later on . You know ? I'm glad that things are out in the open anyway . You know , I do feel better . We'll both be living in New York . Who knows ? You know , anything could happen . Who could that be ? Hello ? Oh , Ken . No , she's right here . One second . Ken , listen . I told you the lights were out and the phone was out . I couldn't call you ! Right . Yes . I still don't know . I'm thinking about spending some time in New York . Please don't bring that up now . It's late and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Oh , God . I didn't know you were still here . I heard your voice . Peter , we're not alone . Steffie , I love you . From the first day . We could be alone . I can't spend the night in the guesthouse . Maybe not the whole night , ... .. but we could have some of it alone together . Oh , God . Would you ? Look , if ... If this means anything to you , ... .. I really want to , but I ... I just love this room . It's just perfect . We could knock this wall out and make one big room . - That's a thought . - It's big enough as it is . I love the size . OK , whatever . - What about fishing ? - The lake has bass , Lane told me . Of course , you can always stock the lake . It seems so inane to dump fish into a lake just to pull ' em back out again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a golfer ! Gim me a break . That's Diane Frazier . I used to have such a crush on her when I 'd see her picture . - Diane Frazier ? Wasn't she ... - She was a model , playgirl . She was always at the Stork Club or El Morocco with some tennis player . - Those people lead such exciting lives . - Yes , don't they ? - It's gon na be great to get out of the city . - I'm so excited about buying a dog . Our co-op doesn't permit dogs and I've always wanted a pit bull . I 'd love to go upstairs and take some measurements . Lane , is it OK to go upstairs ? Oh , well , my mother's still sleeping up there . - Really ? - Yeah . She's a late sleeper . I don't think I ever slept past noon . - She'll be up soon . - Maybe we could see the barn ? Could you show us the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know where it is , don't you ? Just follow that path out of the house . I'll join you in one second . I just wan na finish up . - They gon na buy ? - Looks like it . That's great . Lane , Howard called , and the stand that sells the corn you like is open again . - He's gon na bring some over . - Uh-huh . What's the matter ? Why are you so depressed ? I just think about Peter all the time . Lane , just don't . Don't . I think he's gon na write that book on my mother . God . They're all supposed to go out today together . If she ever gets up . Oh , she's up . She said she 'd be a little late . - Lane , could I speak to you ? - Yes . - We need you to answer some questions . - OK . Their final offer is 175 . 175 ? You said two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This area isn't what it was . But I've really been counting on that money . - Are you sure ? - I'm sorry . - - Yeah ? - Hi . - Hi . Um , Diane said they 'd be a little late . I'll let them know that you're here . You've really been avoiding me . I think you should leave and go back to New York . I 'd like to know what's going on . I'm having a hard time and , even though she tries to hide it , Lane is , too . - Don't say that . - She thinks about you all the time . - And you ? - Naturally , I think about you . And yet you avoid me . - Will you write Diane's biography ? - Believe it or not , I'm thinking about it . Why ? What happened to the book about your father ? I know . I ... It just isn't coming . I told you that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and I ... I don't know . It's lifeless . And then I hear all these sensational anecdotes and stories . You know ? This woman's had an incredible life . I mean , the shooting alone is a book . - Lane doesn't want it written . - I'm not so sure . If I do it , I can protect her . Somebody's gon na write it . Look , Peter , just put yourself in her place for one minute . Here's this 14-year-old girl . Her mother leaves her father , who Lane adored , ... .. and moves in with this thug , who beats up Diane , and Lane ends up shooting him . It's completely wrecked her life . You don't wan na put her through it again . You know , people staring at her as she walks down the street . I don't know . I'm sorry . I'm really sorry . I don't ... I just feel so ... guilt-ridden . I'm just very tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ... Steffie . Let's ... Let's go to Paris together . "" Let's go to Paris together . "" My God . You really are a writer , aren't you ? This is why I have to stay away from you . Because you just make my head ... spin . I just can't ... I can't do this . I can't ... Oh , my God . - I guess we should have knocked . - I always worry about rabies . I read about a woman bitten by a squirrel in Central Park and she got rabies . Nothing like that ever happens up here . What bothers me are not the raccoons but gnats . They drive you crazy . You don't have a big insect problem here , do you , Lane ? Lane ? - But you do have mosquitoes ? - Naturally , with the pond . Well , mosquitoes are rare . Aren't they , Lane ? - Lane ? - It's ... It's usually very pleasant . - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snakes don't eat the frogs ! Is it OK if we go upstairs ? Yes , um ... Sorry . I'm getting a headache . I'll rejoin you in a few minutes . OK , but hurry . There are many questions Mr and Mrs Raines have . Yes . Now , what about hornets and bees ? This is the country , Mrs Raines , not midtown Manhattan . Oh , my God . I just can't believe that happened ! - It was my fault . - Oh , Peter , please ! I just can't handle this ! Lane . Lane , I'm sorry . Lane . Lane , I'm sorry . Please forgive me . - Lane ! - Has this been going on long ? No . No ! Please . Jesus . - Are you in love with him ? - It's not what you think . - What do you mean ? - Lane , I just don't know what I've done . - I just don't know what I've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There's nothing to make sense . Absolutely nothing to make sense . So many times I saw you and Peter looking at each other . No , don't do that . Just don't do that . This is my fault . Stephanie's not to blame . - Leave us alone . - I'm sorry you found out like this . There's nothing to find out . You're making it worse . There's not nothing . Let's get this out on the table . I want Steffie to go with me to New York or Paris . Peter , the summer's over . I'm going back to Philadelphia . I miss my children . I can't play these games . I've been married too long . I just ... I don't know what I am . I don't know what I've done . I just ... I'm not who I thought I was . I'm beginning to think that antique fair will be too crowded . You're getting cold feet about driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought today's the wrong day . We could postpone it . You and Peter could work on the book around here . You know , Peter , I think we could do a whole section on Las Vegas . I know so many great Sammy Davis stories . He's the best . - Did ya tell Lane about our conversation ? - Oh , yeah . Listen , darling . Lloyd and I have decided that we wan na live here . This house is our idea of heaven . I fell in love with it the moment I stepped inside . It was like coming home . I know you're off back to the city , but whenever you wan na use it , it's yours . You know , weekends or the summertime . Whenever . You're gon na need a sweater . I better go up and get one . I don't understand . You know one of my first projects ? I'm gon na put in a pool . I never , ever liked the pond because there's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer . I took her swimming in Santa Fe . She outdid everybody . - She's got perfect legs for a bathing suit . - What are you talking about ? We're gon na move back here . We've discussed it and decided to move back here . Lloyd loves Vermont and I have always loved this house . - And if ... - You can't move back here . - Why not ? - Because I'm about to sell this place . - You're selling it ? - I told you ... - Wait a minute . Since when ? - I've mentioned this three times at least . - You have ? - Don't you ever listen to me when I talk ? Do you only care about what you have to say ? Why are you getting so nasty ? I got people here right now - buyers . They're looking at it . Well , Jesus , wherever they are , just go and find them and tell them the sale is off . - What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be our home . You can't tell me that now . What are you talking about ? This is the family house . How can you sell this place ? You don't own it . - Well , who owns it ? - Uh ... . I do . Well , I mean , we do . You and me . Your father and I bought it . But you gave it to me years ago . I told you then I might sell it and divide the money . - You said great , you could use the cash . - Was I sober when I gave it to you ? - You said it was mine . - To live in , darling , but not to sell . To live in ? What does that mean ? To maintain ? To repair ? To keep up ? Am I the caretaker ? I've said a lot of things in haste . When it comes to practical matters , I'm a dodo . I can't afford to move without selling this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s expensive being sick . - Nobody's throwing you out in the cold . - I've been counting on this money . I haven't been working in two years . I've used up everything . I've borrowed . Darling , it's as simple as this : my plans have changed . - What ? ! - We want to settle here . Your father and I bought this house . He 'd have wanted it to stay in the family . - Can't we discuss this later ? - You're such a phoney ! He bought the house , not you , and I've kept it going ! - Lane ! - Couldn't you have just stayed away ? Lloyd and I are not young . We wan na settle . Who knows ? Maybe we'll hate it and in a year we'll move . My life is just not worth all the trouble ! Everyone , just stop it ! Diane , Lane has been through so much . - Don't get angry , sweetheart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Like I'm to blame for everything . - You are ! - OK , calm down . - I'm calm , Lloyd . I am calm . We all make mistakes , but what's done is done . And if your life didn't turn out , don't keep accusing me ! You're the one who pulled the trigger ! I only said what the lawyers told me to . - What an absurd thing to say . - It's not absurd . It's the truth ! I don't think this is the place to have that discussion . I'm just wrecked ! And you come and go with no guilt ! I don't wan na hear any more of this . Stop it right now . It's her excuse for a life wasted , thrown away to spite me . - That's not true ! - Yes ! Out of spite ! Pure spite ! Maybe things could have been different for me if I didn't have to go through that ! - Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ! - Pardon me ? - Get out of here ! Please , just leave ! - Diane ! Relax ! - Get out of here now ! - Diane , just relax . - OK , take the house . - I didn't realise it meant that much to you . - That's enough . I said she could have the house ! Now can we go ? That's enough ! There are things I might do differently if I had them to do over , but I don't . My head is splitting open ! OK , I'm sorry for all the fuss . We all make mistakes . Lane , can I have the sleeping pills back ? - I don't know where they are . - They're not in the medicine cabinet . - What's the difference ? - That's the stupidest thing I ever heard . What are you talking about , "" what's the difference "" ? Where are they ? I have no reason to get up tomorrow . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . What about your plans to move to New York and set up a photography studio ? You're so damn angry . If I haven't made it as a photographer by now , why would I ? I don't know . You'll just have to try harder , won't you ? So ... .. you and Peter are in love with each other ? We just became very attracted to each other . These things happen . - You knew how much I cared about him . - It happened by itself . I didn't instigate it . You know , we're all up here isolated from the world . Unpredictable things happen . The truth is ... .. I flirted with Peter , ... .. I wanted him to want me , ... .. but I didn't think it would go very far . I just wanted to know that I could be wanted . And he seemed very challenging . You know , he's very clever and busy with his novel . And he's charming and smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. very vulnerable he is and ... .. he's so uncertain . And my heart went out to him . And I began dreaming about him . What's gon na happen ? Are you gon na go away with him ? I can't . No , I can't do that . It's ... It's not so easy when you're married with ... kids . That's something I wouldn't know . Now give me those pills . Tomorrow will come and you'll find some distractions . You'll get rid of this place . You'll move back to the city . You'll work . You'll fall in love . And maybe it'll work out and maybe it won't . But you'll find a million petty things to keep you going , ... .. and distractions to keep you from focusing on the ... On the truth . I don't know what the truth is and you don't either . I just wan na swallow all of this Valium . Well , it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . - I'll take ' em all . - Stop it . Stop it . You're behaving like a petulant child . If you really wanted to die , you would have done that the last time . I'm so lonely . OK , stop it , and just give me the pills . You really wan na die ? No . No . That's my problem . I ... I always wanted to live . Where the hell is everybody ? Where is everybody ? Boy , the going gets rough and everybody vanishes . Lane , we're leaving ! Lane ! God , I hate this outfit . I look like one of the Hundred Neediest Cases . You look beautiful . You know , I'm gon na miss this place . Hadn't realised how pretty it was up here . It's so tranquil . And it's been in the family for so long . It's the closest thing I can think of to roots . It might have been nice . Dear , it's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not in the cards . Palm Beach will be fine . The place is unimportant as long as we're together . Oh , Lloyd . Lane , we're leaving for Palm Beach . If you need me , we're staying with the Chasens . And let's not have a wake over what happened before . It's over and done with . Life's too short to dwell on our tragedies . Right ? Besides , I'm sure we all said things we're sorry for . We're all temperamental . Otherwise , we wouldn't all be so fascinating . I'm sorry if I caused you any grief . OK ? I wasn't thinking . Oh , well . It's over now . Lane , ... .. you always liked this , ... .. and I want you to keep it . Stephanie , ... .. this is for you . I saw you admiring it and I 'd love you to have it . Thank you . Jesus ! Look at my hands . Now , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could merge them into a tan . What do you think ? - Can I help with the bags ? - Oh , my God ! I forgot . Howard , just in time to say goodbye and help with the luggage . I'll get the door . Lloyd , put that hanging piece on top , I beg you . Everything'll be mussed . Thanks , Howard . Terrific . The door's open . Lane , let them get it , honey . Come here . Come here . Now ... No , never mind . You know where we're gon na be , with the Chasens , ... .. so if you need me for anything - your hair looks just darling down like that - .. you call me . D' you hear me ? OK . And tell Peter that I've got to rethink my memoirs . If I come up with a fresh approach , then I'll call him . Goodbye . Be a good girl . Oh , God . Have you got my make-up kit ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly ? I still travel with it . It's like a lucky charm . Maybe I should donate it to the antique fair ! Will I see you again ? I think you should leave . I'm going to stay with Lane and then go back home . It's funny . You meet somebody under strange circumstances . You fall in love and then you go off in separate directions . Peter , please don't make this hard for me . - Please . - I feel so empty . You haven't even gone yet and I feel like I've lost something I'll never find again . I'm so disappointed in myself . Steffie . Time will pass and you'll forget this summer . And you ? Will you forget it ? I'll try . It won't be easy , but I'll try . Now she's off to Palm Beach as though nothing had happened . Well , I really should be going , too . My debts . I have to manage the final sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you not to worry . Howard . And that I'll take care of you , that nothing would make me happier . I've gotten so used to having you in my life . - You're all that gives it meaning now . - Howard , don't . Don't . - I'm sure that ... - I can't . .. when you leave here ... .. I'll never see you again . But I really did grow to love you . Lane . I came to say goodbye . I think it's better if I head back to the city tonight . You haven't finished your book . It's finished . What a sad tone in your voice . I loved all the time we spent together . And I appreciate your faith in me and ... .. the encouragement . I'm sorry I couldn't live up to it . Well ... Take care of her , Howard . - Hi . - Hi . Would you like some tea ? No . - It's chilly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . In a few days it'll be September . I know . There are so many things to do , selling a house . It'll keep you busy . That's good . When do you have to go home ? In a couple of days I'll go back . The kids need school supplies and new shoes . - Sweet kids . - Yeah . Oh , Steffie . Soon you'll leave here and you'll start all over again in

I could charge them , you know . I could put their asses in jail if I wanted to . That's a great idea . You think sarge would give my stripes for getting my ass kicked by a drag queen ? A cold beer would help . Thank you . Smells good , mom . Tell me again about you let my baby get beat up in a gay bar . I got carried away . - Oh ... You never give up .

I'm so thirsty . I'm dieing , mom . I know . I don't want to wait . I want to do it now . What are you saying ? I can feel it getting closer , Mamma . Everyday is harder and harder . What if I wake up one morning and I can't recognize you , you know ... You remember the way it was with grandpa , he didn't know who we were . I don't want to end like that . I don't want to ... I want to do it my own way . No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... You don't want ... You don't want ... Suicide , mom . These chocolates of Gordon's are outrageous . This is a friend of Matt . Your name ? No comment . You don't have to show my face ... Punk ! To be honest with you Mr Campbell . Given the circumstances , a jury would question that kind of behavior , don't you think ? I didn't even want to be there . She made me do it . All that we're trying to do here is establish exactly what happened that night . I want you to tell me what part you played . Mr Matlin , Matt said he wanted this to be special . Immediately I thought of a buffet . - A buffet ? You made a buffet ? You catered a suicide . - Shut up , Judy .

I got two Stevie Nicks albums and a microwave . Mona got some ice tongs and a feather boa . We were not into Mattie for his inheritance . - Miss Eisner ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious matter . A lot of Matt's friends were at that party . He didn't act alone . I helped Matt . November 2001 Aids Treatment . Can I help you ? Oh , Hi , Jackie . A dentist ? Great . Dr Faluti . ... 878 Great . Thanks . Oh , and call me when you get the Tuinal from your your mom's Doctor . Great , ' bye . Hi . This is Amy Eisner . I'm a friend of Jackie Dowling's . I have this impacted tooth and my dentist is out of town . How's it looking for prescription drugs ? Oh , Mona has a junkie friend who might be able to get us morphine . A junkie friend ... Oh , that's good . Take the refills from my doctor ... and make sure you use different pharmacies . Good . Do you think I need a disguise ? No . So tell me , do you have a departure date planned ? I didn't know that undertakers made house calls . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? - I fell off a friend's trampoline . This prescription is for Par ? gorique . It's an opium based anti-diarrhoeal . All that jumping gave her diarrhoea . You are big boy ... I 'd go extra large . Thank you . I could lose my license over this , you know . Look , you can have the rest of them . But keep me out of this . You are part of this , Mrs Snell , whether you like it or not . Look , I wasn't even at the stupid party . I wasn't invited . Thanksgiving Evening , 2001 Have you lost your mind ? - Why ? Have you found one ? Who's that ? You ? You know it is ? - No . Me neither . This is big one in any case . What you are planning to do , man ... It doesn't make sense to me . How do you not know ... It doesn't make sense to me either . Well , why don't you stop moping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another doctor . What do you think I've been doing the last 7 years ? Nothing works anymore . Have you thought about these girls ? They love you . Their first date , their weddings ? I love the girls , you know that . They told me the last 6 weeks that I was gon na die . And what I've gone through since then , I can't do again . Well , I don't know what you are planning to do , Mattie . But you do not include me or mom . Do you hear me ? . Mommie is talking to Uncle Matt right now , sweetheart . You keep mom out of this . For once , think of her . I only hope that my daughters will be that kind for me . You don't have to go , mom . You don't . I keep imagining his face ... What he'll look like when it's over . When he's dead . - Okay , Mom . Stop it . That's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done this a long time ago . Gaby , it's what he wants , okay ? Just sit down somewhere . I think he'll look peaceful ... like he's sleeping . What is wrong with you ? Act like a mother . You lay off of her ! Sometimes the only way to protect a defenseless child is to ... Let him go back to God . I'm nott promising anything . That I'll be like Shirley MacLaine at his death bed . Remember Terms of Endearment ? Uh-huh .. She the Academy Award for that . What a perfect outfit . This sort of brings out the Sean Connery in you . You get out much ? - What happened the night Matthew Schapiro died ? He had a fucking blast ! Welcome viewers to a very special show . We are at Matt Shapiro's "" Event "" . The first time anyone's been inside one of these gatherings with a camera . Tell me who you are . - I'm Jodi , this is Alex , my boyfriend . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What's the celebration ? You don't know ? - No , I don't know . Oops ! Be selective . Be pleasant . Be firm . Ther's no reason for things to get physical . Okay ? Michael Musto is definitely an A . As for the rest , decide for yourself . Is Ru Paul on the A list or B list ? - If she's in drag then , A . If not , then , B . I'm trusting in you . Listen , later on I might not get the chance to say goodbye , so ... Laurie Anderson is definitely a B now . It's so much more ... ... . .. I'm gon na be all rigt ... . - Promise me you'll get some therapy . Oh , Fuck Off ! Why I have'nt I got one ? - Why , of course , you can have a VIP pass . Good . I was always at my best with you . But get a vocal coach before you screw up . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurting people . Count age by friends , and not in years . Count your days smiles and not your tears . That's the last thing you're gon na say to me ? That , and that I'm in love with you . Ever since I've known you . Marry me ... HELLO ... EXCUSE ME ... Could I have your attention for a moment please ? Could we have a moment of silence ... For Matt . Ten minutes and then , to bed . And then The Simpsons ended . See ya . there was so much ... love in that room . Sometimes people die alone .. But ... this , this ... This was beautiful . That was it .. I hooked up the IV and watched the liquid flow down the tube and into his veins . You know ... That second , when I realized he was dead ... You feel so bad ... ' Cos then I was dead . Is there anything else you want to add to your confession ? They all killed themselves . Eddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wasn't there , but I know it ... See , all my clients die , but half of them won't wait . And sometimes ... they have parties ... to say goodbye . And , whether you like it or not , unless you can cure them they're just gon na keep on doing it . Stand up and put your hands on the table . I 'd like to add something to my statement . All right . Go ahead . It took a few tries to get a vein . I don't know why Matt asked me to do it . I hate needles . But how could I say no ? After I got it in , it was easy to connect the IV line . You're telling me that you assisted a man's suicide . - Yeah , that's right . I hooked up the bag of Dilotit . - Dilaudid . The drip was so slow that I had to squeeze the bag to empty it . It got all over his shirt . He breathing became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he opened his eyes wide and he was gone . You're really good . Really thorough Your mother must be proud of him . - She is ... Thank you . And your father ? - He passed away . Oh , I'm sorry . How did he die ? - He didn't die , he was a police officer . He died in the line of duty . Your father was a hero . To me , my son was a hero . He had tumors growing on his brain . Terrible seizures , and there was no way to help him . Mrs Schapiro , it is unfair to lose someone you love , but there has to be laws . When your father was laying there , suffering ... Did any lawyer's opinion matter more than the his ? What are you going to do to me ? My son is gone ... In my world , love .. is above the law . How many of them confessed ? Six . That would be sick if all of them did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them ? God damn it .. There was one night , when the pain was unbearable ... The morphine wasn't doing enough . So he asked me if I would give him a bunch of sleeping pills so he could end it . He said that nobody would have to know . Oh God , Nick . I told him I wouldn't do it . He was begging me , mom . I just don't know if I did the right thing . So , I followed your trail . Did it lead you to the killers ? It scattered in the wind around Union Square . I'm sorry about arresting you . Now you have a record . I went a little too far . And I'm sorry ... about your loss . You think you know how you're gon na react , but you ... we fool ourselves . Want to know what happened ? I love you . I can stop this , lila . He'll wake up tomorrow and be pissed off but er ... He'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please , don't let all this be in vain . Please ... That's all I ask .

He's thrown up all the pills . - What does that mean ? Maybe you should leave . - No . I can't . I can't . Hi , Bri . If you're playing this , then that means it's over ... I wanted to thank you ... and tell you not to feel bad or carry what I did around , like it's some big secret . You can tell whoever you need to ' cos that's your job . It's the survivor's jog to tell the story . Anyway , I wrote a little piece for you . I hope you like it . Take care of mom . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I give you this ?

Besides , we need to take the "" in "" good times and bad "" vow , right ? This is gon na be great practice for the bad . My name is father heery , and welcome to your engagement encounter . I know that some of you are here only because this program is a prerequisite for being married in the catholic church . The church , who I represent , has gotten many things wrong in its past . This , I think , is one of the things that we've gotten right . [Laughing] Oh , wow . Wow , she set everything up without me . Huh . [Laughs] Cool . Hello , you two . [Laughs] Come inside . I have champagne . [Laughs] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe . [Laughs] [Indistinct_conversation] Yes ? Yeah . Great . [Laughs] More ? Yeah . Okay , that's good . All right . Thank you . [Laughter] Let me see that . Oh . Oh . I know . It was burning hole in my pocket . Could not wait until Christmas Eve . And you never know if another guy was gon na swoop in and ask her first . [Laughs] I 'd have to start throwing punches , just like you taught me . Oh , yeah ... stomach , chin , nose . [Both_laugh] Oh , Deb , I'm so glad that you're with us for the holidays . Now , if there are any special traditions or foods that remind you of Christmas at your folks's house , please tell me . Everything pastry . Deb doesn't even need a reminder of Christmas . Yeah , just put it out . I will inhale . [Laughter] I'm gon na balloon this weekend . Oh , please . There's plenty of time before you have to slip into that wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rehearsal dinner . Just find a church with a really long aisle . [Laughter] Good idea . So , you're getting married in the church ? We've been engaged for five hours , mom . Okay . Nice . Debbie , I don't know what your family traditions are for Christmas Eve , but Melissa and roddy and I go to midnight mass . Maybe you can get this guy to join us ? For old time's sake ? I'm gon na go get the luggage . Especially since it's being offered in his father's honor . You know , it's 15 years this year ? I don't need a mass to remind me . I was saying that to Debbie . Why don't you think of it as a celebration ? It's not an occasion I feel like celebrating . How much did they charge you to say the mass in dad's memory , by the way ? It's a suggested donation , and I gave more than they suggested , ' cause I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me lobby for your salvation . Oh , how the song remains the same . Okay , time for bed . We have a party tomorrow . Mwah ! [Laughs] Honey , I understand how someone can lose their faith in this day and age , but you get older , and it can ... mom . Oh , honey , I'm sorry . Yes . Too much champagne . Uh , I'm sorry for bringing all this up on your big night . I-I was just trying to ... you were just talking about the weekend . [Laughs] Yeah . The weekend . [Laughs] Oh , I'm so glad you're here , both of you . And I am overtired , so I'm gon na go up , say my prayers , and thank God that you two found one another and that you decided to do something about it . [Laughs] We were the same age you are now ... now . Too many people your age wait too long . But I always thought that if you find the right person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life gets in the way and messes things up . Mom , I love you . Oh . I know . I love you , honey . He would have been so happy for you . [Laughs] I know . Really , good night . Let me assure you that this weekend is not for the church . It's for you ... the couple as a couple . If you immerse yourself in the work of this weekend , it can be the greatest experience of your relationship so far . Who here can say that their fianc ? is the first person to whom they've said "" I love you "" in an adult , romantic way ? Thank you . By most of you not raising your hand , you've admitted that your fianc ? is not the first person you've loved . And that's not surprising . People get married later nowadays , but what it does suggest is that this thing that we call love is not the only thing that makes a marriage last . I mean , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feeling would be enough . Ladies and gentlemen , the road to marriage is littered with the broken plans of many wonderful couples who , with full-throated conviction , stepped to the altar and vowed the most serious of promises but then , for , oh , a variety of reasons , decided to separate . What's with father doomsday ? Shh . And yet , you are convinced your marriage will be different . Your workbooks are for a process called t.W.O.S ... Talking , writing , openness , and sharing . And you'll be led in some exercises by our married couple , Theresa and Mike . [Applause] All right . * let's get this party started [laughs] All right , we 'd like you each to write down your fianc ? ' s most endearing quality and then turn and tell them . Come on . You're an amazing friend . Your kindness . Oh , you're actually doing this ? Two seconds . You are the most unselfish person I know . I don't come close to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Both_laugh] You're a great lay . [Chuckles] What ? Your dedication to your work . You're good at organizing clutter . I don't think I heard the question right . Yeah ... No . Your sense of humor . I mean , cook . Good cook . Yummy stuff always . Okay . I'm changing mine . Everything . That can't be true . That can't be true . I knew you 'd say that , so I started a footnoted list underneath "" everything , "" like your smile , which conveys your deep reserves of kindness , your willingness to believe the best about people , uh , your generosity of spirit , of [laughter] , the way you focus your eyes when you're really listening , the sigh you make after we make love ... Okay , okay . Your total determination to achieve every position from that "" position of the day "" desk calendar you bought me . [Laughing] We're in a church . Look , God is all-knowing . I mean , your flexibility is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so try , while you're here , to get your mind off your wedding plans ... the bridesmaid who hates her dress , the groomsman who still hasn't given you his tuxedo sizes . [Laughs] Clear your head of all the expectations , all the worries , and relax . Close your eyes . Come on , come on . Close your eyes and think about the early moments right after you got engaged . Close my eyes with a priest in the room ? [Laughs] No , sir . Think about the early moments after you said "" yes , "" the moment after you've leaped from hope into faith and the journey toward matrimony began . I love that we live together in New York , and yet , my mother puts us in separate bedrooms . It's fun . You get to sneak in later . Mm-hmm . Honey , what is with the cowboy hat ? Kevin henges shaved half my head . I think I chose wisely . Are you gon na ask Kevin to be your best man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dawn . "" Junior class writing award "" ? How come I don't know about this ? Two guys entered the contest . I wrote about my dead dad . He wrote about the virtues of cuervo . It was your first award as a writer . And my last . Doesn't mean there won't be a next . No . No , no . We should wait until Christmas . You didn't . [Laughs] I saw you pick it up at the store that time , and you looked at it for a while . Thank you . I love it . [Both_laugh] No . Come on . The journal's enough . "" The artist's way . "" It says that if you write three pages every morning , just whatever's on your mind , it inspires stuff , and it lets your imagination run wild . I've become less intrigued with my imagination . Ever since you met me . No , I went back to school before I met you . I just knew I needed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leave healed . I like that . I've read your stories , and I love your stories . You moved to New York to become a writer . You know what my dream is ? You and me and our family-to-be . [Laughs] Speaking of which , maybe we should get started on making that family right now ? Shh . Your mom will hear . No . I'm not gon na scream . I'm not gon na scream this time , I promise . [Indistinct_conversations] Mary ... [Laughs] Who do you think has played "" margaritaville "" more ? Me or Jimmy buffett ? [Both_laugh] I never really liked doing drugs till I met you . Mm-hmm . Aww . [Laughs] Wait till I introduce you to cannibalism . [Laughing] What ? [Laughs] Are you kidding ? [Both_laugh] I've never seen people eat so many cold cuts . Your platter design was irresistible . I found that meat like a caterer . Mm , mm . I'm thinking of moving out here and starting my own business . You only got laid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better situation . Look , I e-mailed Dave your r ? sum ? . He's gon na get it to people . I'm not asking you to fix it . You know , there was a time when a guy could help fix something and it wasn't called fixing . It was called loving . Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah ? [Both_laugh] Thinks Christmas is good . [Laughing] Yes . Mcguire . Oh ! Hey , hey ! [Laughs] Kevin , you stinker . Oh , has that nativity scene ever looked better ? Yes , in 1993 , just before you drop-kicked the bear . There were no bears in Bethlehem . Mrs . mcguire , time to face the facts , huh ? I like chipmunks . Well , where is your drunken son ? In the backyard , canoodling with his fianc ? e . His what ? ! [Laughs] So ... What the fuck ? ! Merry Christmas . What the fuck ? ! [Both_laugh] Hey , kids , Santa claus is here . Hey , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right now ? Am I that out of the loop ? No , man , no loop . Don't tell me that there is some New York imposter best friend that you conferred with instead of me . I didn't need to confer . I just needed to do it . Kev , where's your new girlfriend ? Uh , date . Oh , I'm sorry . Where's your date ? Inside bothering your mom . [Laughs] I'll go save her . All right . Uh ... Glassy eyes , tight jeans . Oh , just my type . Mm-hmm . [Both_laugh] I'll see you after church . Mwah ! You don't need to represent . [Laughs] No , it'll make your mom happy . Oh . All right . I think he'll be a good best man . Fun best man . Yeah . [Both_laugh] I got it . Shut up . [Laughs] Cheers , asshole . Cheers , you fuck-wad .

I mean ... Kind of like that . So ... What's the story ? Are you dying ? Yeah , eventually . But there hasn't been a recent diagnosis of some life-ending illness ? I love her . I'm never gon na find any better . That's no reason to stop exploring the nether regions of all the rest of womankind . You are 28 years old , sir . Old enough to start living my life with someone else . Oh , hey , Andy Rooney , drink a beer , huh ? [Laughs] [Groans] God , global warming , huh ? I love it . [Laughs] [Laughs] Hey , I got to ask you something . If I'm shocked ? Yes . What ? Spill it . I knew you dug her . She seems cool . But you've only brought her back home like twice , and , yeah , I was a little buzzed both times . Yes . And , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% fuckable ... whoa ! You were a well-traveled connoisseur of numerous vaginas before you met her . Oh , let's don't exaggerate . And as a fellow fan of vaginas ... can you quiet down , please ? I came out of one . I'm allowed to use the word . [Chuckles] I'm just saying ... to see an enthusiastic vaginal aficionado veer off course and , without warning , settle on just one , well , it is quite ... you might as admit ... portentous . Are you done ? Well ... It's as it should be . For some sorry bastards . So , how 'd you finally know ? You know , deep down , you know pretty quickly . You just don't admit you know because ... I don't know ... you wait until you feel like you're the type of man who's worthy to ask someone to say "" yes . "" Who are you ? The fucking riddler ? Tell me about a blinding white light . There's no lights . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the rest of your life with someone else , and it's picking that someone else . Well , if that's the case , I should probably just blow my fucking head off . [Door_opens] Come on ! Come off it ! You couldn't tell me over the phone ? ! Way to go ! Thanks , man . I wanted to tell you in person . Oh ! Oh , Kevin , merry Christmas . And to you , man . It's roddy , for probably like the fifth time . [Laughs] Yeah , yeah . Sorry . I spaced my contact . Yeah , that's what you said last year , but whatever , man . I'll let it slip because right now , my brother-in-law's finally getting engaged ! Oh , fantastic ! Man , you are gon na love it . It's work , but it's ... but it's great . And you're great , dom , ' cause I got the bonus . Well done . You well done , you . [Laughs] You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have just lamed out and not gone in and got what I deserved . But I thought about what you said and I said , "" dom didn't "" give me this advice to make me crumble . He gave me this advice so I "" could soar . "" I didn't know you 'd become a motivational speaker . I walked in there channeling you . [Laughs] I said to wajowski , "" I have "" done over 17 installations above average , and I came to claim "" what is rightfully mine . "" And he just , you know , tilted his head a little , paused , ruminated on what he knew to be the truth , and then just cowered , acknowledged my above-and-beyondness and just paid me right there . He cut my bonus check right there . Oh , I'm sorry ... right here . Nicely done . Bank that . Well , most of it . Uh , when Melissa's "" acting "" "" class "" is over , we're gon na splurge and hit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole deal ... my treat . No , you and Melissa spend it on yourselves . No , no . You've got to come with . I got a ton of radisson points . We could stay on the club level , get free breakfast ... tons of different juices , the whole deal . Please , let me just give something back . We'll get out the calendars . Yeah , we will . Oh , my God , I am so lucky I married into this family . Come here , man . I love you . Oh , I love you , too . [Laughs] I guess I'll have to console Deb when she finds out what you're really like . Shut up . [Laughs] How are you ? Oh , little brother , you did good . Oh , hey , Kevin . Melissa , sorry . Wow . I didn't even ... uh , holy shit , uh , you look incredible . What the hell ? Did you get lap-band surgery or something ? You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh . Okay . Sister . Wife . [Both_laugh] Hey , roddy , you want a beer ? No , I got to go to church . I'm gon na need hard alcohol . No shots . Oh , for you , my dear , the world and more . Mwah ! [Laughs] Look at the two of us ... the troll and the supermodel . It's almost as if my reward , for the punishment of me having to be me , is marrying you and then having you transform into this . [Laughs] All right , you Saint Bernard , stop slobbering . So , mom wanted me to come out here to see if you're gon na come to midnight mass . She wants to leave early to get a good seat . Well , no . I am in too good a mood to relocate to a place that will alter that mood , thank you . Are you about to reveal a priestly molestation story ? Uh , I will if it means I don't have to go . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shit out of you . Dare you . [Laughs] We're leaving in 15 . Uh , I don't even ... How ? The hard way ... diet and dedication . She just got tired of carrying around the extra pounds . Extra pounds ? Extra person . Dude , it's my sister . No , I grew up with your sister . That person who was just here I have never met . I mean , she weighed two bills in junior high . Now she's like the female subway sandwich guy . Do not say that to her . [Clears_throat] Say what you will , you can't stop me from fucking her in my mind . Oh , God . Melissa looks great . How's her acting classes going ? Ugh . Unfortunately , no one's ever written a book called "" don't follow your dreams . "" [Laughter] I'm gon na . That book will fucking change the world . Chapter 1 ... choosing the wrong dream will just fuck you up . [Laughs] You know , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to football camp for two weeks every summer to get better ? Yes . Did my dad run drills with me before going to work ? Yes . Did my mom make special meals to help me manage my weight ? Yes . And did I make the football team ? No , and it crushed me . It ... it crushed me , and I-i just don't want her to be crushed . I think it's great that she's found something that makes her feel useful . Walk a mile , Deb . Walk a mile in my timberlands and then report back . [Bell_tolling] I thought I was marrying a size-12 retail buyer , and then , out of nowhere , at 33 years old , just some hibernating acting dream just sprouts up out of nowhere ? I mean , I'm glad she got into shape , but , seriously , this delusion that she's gon na be an actress has just taken ahold of her like some insatiable fungus that is devouring the common-sense part of her brain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You'll see . Why does this news make me sad ? For myself , not you . When you find a girl you want to spend the rest of your life with , you'll ask her . Dom . D-d-dom . D-d-dom . No . Thank you . Well , what if I already found her and she wanted no part of me ? Well , you write some songs and you move on . In theory . I remember last summer , we talked on the phone for an hour about what you were gon na do when you saw her at your buddy heisner's wedding . Oh , yeah , that wedding got moved to Montana . My credit cards are all maxed out . I never got to go , never got to confront . Well , give it another nine years . That's the plan . Isn't she married ? Like that matters . Yeah . Burn it . It's salvageable . What about this date you got wandering around my mother's kitchen on Christmas Eve ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , luckily , I'm still in the enigma phase with her . She hasn't caught on to how useless I am as a man . Not that I'm gon na clue her in just yet . The sex is too good . Yeah , that is when I close my eyes and can't see her looking back at me chock-full of expectation and hope . [Indistinct_conversations] It's beautiful . [Laughs] Can I ask you something ? When did you know that my brother was the right one for you ? You mean when did I fall in love with him ? No , that's not always the same thing . For me , it was . He let my father's barbershop quartet teach him to sing . [Laughs] No . Dom has a horrible voice . Yeah , I know . He knows . But it was so important to my dad , it's like the one important thing , and dom recognized that . So , there he was in the kitchen with my father's barbershop-quartet friends , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause it's the one low voice that you could possibly get away with . Not if you're tone-deaf . [Both_laugh] I know . And I just stood there baffled at my good fortune . And I thought , "" I'm really in "" love with this guy . "" That's so sweet ... And specific . What about you and roddy ? Oh , I don't know . I was smoking so much pot back then , I can't remember . No , we , uh ... we met at this weight-loss thing , and he was all goofy and persistent . And I don't know . Well , you know , if there's any true tradition on the guy's part , for the girl , the whole proposal thing is kind of like a sneak attack . They know they're gon na do it , but you don't know they're gon na do it , and then they do it and it's great , but you're ... You're , like , all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roddy and I were engaged , she sighed . Right before , "" honey "" , "" congratulations , "" it was , like , this slight-yet-audible sigh , as if to say , "" thank God my fat "" daughter squeaked in . "" [Laughs] Your mother adores you . Oh , no , I know . I'm fine . I don't think about it . That's a line . [Laughs] That's just my mom . That's how she reacted , bless her heart . To mom , marriage equals happiness . Oh . Mom , what's wrong ? I forgot to hang dad's stocking . Santa doesn't come till we're asleep . [Sighing] Oh . Nothing like the nurturing smell of Providence back in your nasal passages , huh ? The wafting stench of the broken dreams of losers , like myself , stuck here , incapable of leaving this shithole . Still love Rhode island , huh ? Ugh ! Why don't you pack up the truck and drive yourself across state lines . It's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big apple , where I'll find true love and artistic reward ? Anything but this . Because I know a guy who moved away six years ago with Hemingway aspirations , who took a dive and became a physical therapist . There you go . There's a dig . You know what , kev ? Every Christmas for the last seven years , we have the same conversation . We have some beers , we have some [laughs] , and then without fail , you start bitching about being stuck here like you're on Alcatraz . Oh , Mr . getting-married-guy has finished all his thinking on all the big thoughts . He's got his how-to guidebook on how things work ? And he's got a few tips , huh ? Yeah . Watch what you say about my fianc ? e and watch what you say about my sister . They were compliments . You know , you come in here and you dismiss my engagement with some "" are you sure ? "" Bullshit . You make some crude comments about the fuckability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister ? I was joking . Find another way to joke . It's not funny anymore . Walk it off , dom . Dude , look at yourself ... Shit-faced and stoned . It's Christmas ! Burying your talent , dragging around some poor girl who you're gon na give the boot to with your well-rehearsed , fake sorry . "" You're too good for me . "" Congratulations . You've gotten back all of womankind for the one that you didn't get . Do you know what friends do ? Bitching is what friends do together . May I remind you that your first and only published short story is entitled "" Providence sucks "" ? You're being a fucking asshole . That's why I came over ! The pleasure of your company has always been that I could act like an asshole without getting reamed for it . All good times have to come to an end , right ? Oh . Hmm . Awesome , dude . Hey ! Put in that your book . I'm glad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m glad that you're so fucking complete that my meaningless bitches now bore you . Good luck with your speaking tour . Merry fucking Christmas . [Sighs] Mary , wake up ! We're leaving ! All : * sing in exultation * word of the father * now in flesh appearing * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * Christ the lord feel free to spread out all over the grounds while you write . Just be in hearing range . When I ring this bell , you should make your way back here for our next talk . Tell one another your vision of what you want your shared future to be . Okay . I know you're gon na make a great dad . I like thinking about that ... How you'll create a home where our kids will prosper . And you'll love them and teach them and provide for them , and it's powerful thinking about that and watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . I-I'm not finished . Oh . I want to be a mom . You'll be an amazing mom . Sometimes , I feel like I won't be the kind of great mom that I want to be ... I disagree . And like I won't be the kind of mom that can constantly get on top of things and , you know , to be a mom that doesn't lose my mind . We'll get you some valium . [Laughs] You know , it worked for my mother . Did it ? [Laughs] Not really . I don't know . I just ... I see my cousin so stressed and snippy with tom ... yeah , that's different people . That's different situations . Yeah , but do you remember that time when she was loading Lucy and Brian into the van at hersheypark ? Yeah . [Laughs] Yeah . I mean , she was ... she was screaming at them and ... and they weren't listening and they were all over the place and she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired and overwhelmed . She was wild , like ferocious wild , like ... like some instinctual altered state that must have been induced by childbearing . You're ... you're not your cousin . Yeah , but she wasn't always like that . I'm not tom . You are Debbie . I'm ... trying to change the subject . No . I'm trying to end the comparison . I mean , they are they , and we are we . * you are not your cousin please don't sing . * and I am not tom [bell_ringing] Never too late to be saved by a bell . * you , my dear Debbie , will be a great mom * you didn't read yours . I basically wrote everything I just said ... Up until the singing , of course . [All_scatting] Man , you got it . You got it ! You still want me to sing with you guys ? Yes ! You're incredible . Gentlemen ... No more . We've got a wedding to plan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deejay over here on the stage . Or ... If you want , uh , Maggie row's son is in a band called destiny that plays all over Syracuse . Yeah , I-i don't want Steve row playing at wedding . No , I don't know . We could go hear him , you know . No , Steve row gave me a wedgie in the fifth grade . What ? He was flirting with you . Yeah , I'll go give his old man a wedgie right now . What ? With your barbershop quartet ? If needs be . You know , Harry can rumble . No , if you did the lighting in here , this place could be awesome . That's what we thought . Yeah , I was in charge of my senior prom . We turned , uh , the gym into a 1920s jazz hall . I always thought that this place would make a great speakeasy . The bridesmaids could be flappers ! Hey , wait a minute . Johnny marr has a bubble machine ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Definitely doable . Their pensions got decimated . I can't take their money . I need to generate more income . Hey , you're gon na get that job on Tuesday , okay ? I know it . [Both_laugh] Part of the reason that our church does this program is our experience with couples who get challenged by the shift between marriage as an idea and marriage as a relationship . 1-in-10 couples who participate in this decide not to move forward with their wedding because of issues that come up over this weekend . And you know what ? That's okay , because this weekend is about exploring one thing ... what makes this love you have for the person you sit next to a love that will thrive ? What ... what makes this love that ... that you bring to the marriage table one that will conquer all ? Yes ! Uh , high score . [Laughter] We here at the engagement encounter believe that communication is not just saying what you want and demanding that the other person agree . When we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of being a mom , but I had difficulty letting go of my career . Mike was gone for long stretches , and I used to think to myself , "" well , this isn't "" what I thought it would be like ... waiting around for a five-minute phone call every couple of days or shuttling the kids around while he was off in Chicago or Kansas City or Boston , meeting interesting "" people . "" Pharmaceutical reps aren't interesting . [Laughter] Don't let things fester . This is the time for really taking off the masks and showing who you really are . Boo . Can I read this thing I didn't read a second ago ? Of course . I don't know why I didn't read it . I-I ... I guess I'm embarrassed . I , um ... about what ? About how un-useful so much of what I'm ... I'm skilled at has turned out to be . Deb , you're not your job . You talk about being a physical therapist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and ... and you're right . I'm a physical therapist . I have a degree in marketing . Which has gotten you good jobs and good benefits . Job benefits aren't life benefits . Sure they are . Before I got laid off , I never really had to examine what I was doing to define my life . You know , I-i ... I don't know . I moved to New York to work in publishing . Publishing ... a dying industry . And ... and , you know , and I took these jobs tangentially related to that because I thought I was gon na ... I was gon na pay my dues , and I did . You're 25 years old . Exactly . I'm 25 years old . I'm ... I'm four years out of college . Maybe I should work in the red cross or something like you talk about . I just don't want to feel like I'm stuck somewhere with nothing to offer . I'm not gon na let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really nice , but , uh ... but there's nothing . Okay . I appreciate your time . Uh , do you know who might be hiring ? I mean , I check the online boards , and everything looks so crappy . I-I thought you were hiring . [Laughs] Interviewing . We just have a hiring freeze . When there's an interview freeze , that's when things get really bad ... not just bad-bad , but really bad . But some people say that things are turning around . Others say that it's going back in the dumper and that this recent rally was just a trap , and we may have to gnaw off our limbs just to survive . I mean , metaphorical limbs , but real enough to hurt . I just keep reassuring myself that somebody needs me . But do you ever feel that what you have to offer just isn't enough ? Not until recently . Hmm . Thank you for your time . [Siren_walls] You feel all right ? Good . Paging Dr . menter . Paging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving . I hate it . I hate coming here . I hate seeing you . Well , the day after tomorrow , we'll hate some more . If I don't kill myself first . [Laughs] I'll call to confirm . Hold her head underwater next time . I promise I won't tell . I heard that . My lungs are better than yours , Freddy , you cigarette-smoking prick . [Indistinct_conversations] , [horns_honking] Sister Mary Roberts ! It's me , Christine . Oh , sister Mary Roberts , you look great . I'm sorry . I'm not ... how was your mission in Guatemala ? Uh , still a lot of pagans there , I believe , right ? The ... the numbers have dwindled , but we're ... we're making progress . Oh , people would worship anything , wouldn't they ? Look at us here . Look at all the odd stuff . But still , it is comforting . Besides , you have to bet on something , especially at my age . [Chuckles] I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s so nice to see you back at our parish . We need more people here with your devotion . God bless . Oh ! Seriously , stop . Come on . Give it back . Jennifer , if he hurts me , I want you to be my therapist . [Laughs] I can hardly take care of myself . "" Wedding budget . "" I thought the bride's parents paid . Yeah , well , they're retired . You're nice . Or stupid . Now I feel bad that I'm about to borrow cigarette money . [Laughs] Why do you support his habit ? Because I want him to die young . Get in line . Oh , hey , tonight , at the therapy pool , annual naked cannonball competition . Who's in ? Besides Jen . Look , this is an annual thing , Jen , where you get in the pool where we heal people and turn it into a cannonball frolic . [Laughs] Dom , you take it easy . You take a load off . I'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" O "" team to icu . So , how's the plans going ? Great . Just crunching numbers , basically . You need me to cook ? I'm no gourmet chef , but you get me a pot that's big enough , I can make pasta to feed 100 . Yeah ? That's about it . [Both_laugh] Pasta , house salad , brownies . I owe you . No , you don't . It was a bad way to be introduced , stumbling across me crying in a stairwell . Hey , it's a hospital . We're used to people crying . Not some silly girl weeping over some dumb dude I fell in love with . Yeah . Has he called back yet ? He says he's still confused . Screw him . That was the goal , at least one last time . [Both_laugh] Well , it's a half day for me . I got to go pick out a wedding cake . Oh , don't get one with a lot of flowers . That's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosting petals . My sister got real flowers to sprinkle on top . It looked just as nice . Cost less . Good tip . [Both_laugh] Uh , more people like chocolate than vanilla . Keep the tips coming . Much obliged . [Indistinct_conversations] [Siren_walls] [Door_opens] Hey ! Hi . You're home early . Took a half day from work to meet you at turnover's . Remember ? Oh , my God . I left you a bunch of messages . I just figured your phone died . I'm so sorry . I-I turned off my phone , and then I guess I forgot I turned off my phone . It's okay . I'm sorry , dom . You've got to try this , okay ? Oh , my God . You're not mad at me ? No . I'm saving my anger for something ... Important . [Both_laugh] Oh , my God , that's really good . Isn't that incredible ? [Laughs] How much ? Well , they're $600 or we can get the same cake . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , less sugar . That's right . I've seen that . Haven't you ? Where do you come up with these amazing ideas ? [Laughs] You taste like cake . So do you . [Laughs] Ah , leave it . How do I make you see what I see ? How do I make you want what I want ? That door . That door you're thinking about going through ... it's a real door . It's a real door that will shut all by itself once you go through it . Can't you see that ? You can make the wrong move . You can twist your fate . You can take a road that you think is right and awaken and find that it's all wrong . It's all ... Wrong . Don't you understand what I'm saying ? Love me . Love me . [Crying] Love me . [Cheers_and_applause] Easy on the applause . We're trying to stay in the scene and do strong work , not perform for results or applause . Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments you were pushing . I just got a little caught up . [Laughs] If you're gon na do all the feeling for us , we don't have to feel at all , right ? We can just kick back and detach . We don't have to participate , right ? We can just judge whether or not your display of emotion is authentic . And we're gon na do that regardless . [Laughter] But there's mystery if you give us room to lean in a little , to participate , to wonder . At the moment when your heart is breaking , I want to see you trying desperately to not cry . I won't make that mistake again . [Laughs] Class is the place for mistakes . Mistakes lead us to deeper truths . You dug deep . Nice work . See you all Friday . [Indistinct_conversations] [Sniffles] Oh . What a nice surprise ! I texted you . I was looking for tuxedos a few blocks from here . I thought you could come along , help make sure I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone off in class . I didn't get the text . I'm sorry . Hey , this is my class . Yeah . This is my teacher , James . James , this is dom , my brother . I was telling him about you . Oh , hey , man . Nice to meet you . Yeah , you too . You're the reason she got started here , right ? Yeah , I bought her a birthday present of some acting classes , you know , wherever she wanted to take them . Well , we're glad she chose here . Did you catch that last scene ? Yeah , I caught the end , and I got to tell you ... I was not detached at all . I was absorbed and fully into it . Good . That's what we're going for . But nice to meet you . We shall see you Friday . Okay . Incredible . Thanks . Your teacher's taken quite a shine to you . He's proud . Proud and grabby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . You ? My showcase is coming up . James thinks I'm gon na get an agent . I can't go . We got to get mom to move here . Yeah , she can chaperone you in acting class . It's good . He's like that with everyone . It's more ironic than actual . I don't know what that means . Well , I can't explain it then . Yeah . Just watch out , okay ? I think I saw him trying to undo your bra strap . [Both_laugh] You know , would it kill you to let me be the pretty girl for once ? Okay . [Both_laugh] * untethered and free * floating out to the sea * I need you to look after me * it's now summer long * it's a cold winter's dawn * I better , I better keep moving on * * I need you to care while I'm gone * [engine_shuts_off] [Birds_chirping] Mom ? I'm back here , dom ! What are you doing ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! [Sighs] Get down ! Oh ? King of the world , huh ? A leaky roof doesn't mean I need to sell the house . You want real marshmallows or fluff ? Fluff , please . [Liquid_pouring] So , you don't want to live in . New York City near your kids ? Uh , you mean , uh , do I want to be cooped up in a tiny apartment , which I can't afford , in a city without friends , while my two adult children are busy with their lives ? No . I'm never too busy for you . Oh , yes , you are , and it's okay . You've got your own life . I do miss you and your sister and I wish you lived closer . I miss being a parent and , you know , having influence in your lives . I think I would be so much better at it now . Yeah , I-i know more . Mom , stop . That conversation that we had at Christmas ? I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how I handled ... you handled it as well as you could have . I did it badly . No . Trying to get you to feel joy about some idea about ultimately being reunited with daddy in heaven . There's nothing joyful about a boy losing his father . You did great . Seriously . We were all in the same boat , and we did great . I mean it . I couldn't have landed a girl like Deb without being raised by a mom like you , could I ? You sweetie . Want some fluff ? No . Some cocoa ? * I can't be clear , but all I want to say * * I'm a wreck since the day you've gone * * I try to fit things together , and it seeps through * * it doesn't seem to matter what I do * * I'm useless without you , dear * * I'm useless without you * my dear [cheers_and_applause] Great show , man . Thanks . I should have minded my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . You should play that last one at our reception . I'm invited ? Yeah , if you be my best man . You got really low standards , you know ? Yeah , I do . Hey , don't go wasting your vow on me . [Laughs] To friendship and longevity , to forgiveness and to an elimination of jackassery , except for occasional glimpses that harm no one . Cheers . Cheers . Mary ? [Laughs] What ? Is that Mary ? Yes . Things sort of fell apart after Christmas . So , I get to host the bachelor party . Oh . Seriously . Oh , rest yourself . Rest yourself , son . It's gon na be all taken care of . Don't you think about a thing . There will be no shenanigans . There may be drunken ... there will be drunkenness , but there will be no shenanigans . Do you understand ? There ... there's gon na be drunkenness . I got you . Your voice sounded great tonight , by the way , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no tobacco . Nice ! Good for you . That's good . Yeah . Well , this is my problem . I never thought I was designing a wee little life with tiny victories like not smoking pot for consecutive days or finally posting my songs on a website for people to disparage . Your songs about Betsy kill me . [Chuckles] I'm serious . You know , that song you wrote about sister Julie's English class says more in three minutes about growing up than I ever could in a novel . Oh ... No , no , no . Maybe ... maybe a song you write helps someone ... Miserable existence . Make sense out of their life , you know ? Mm . You just ... you got to ... you got to just progress with that in your mind , you know ? Maybe it's time I came down to New York . There you go . Betsy just got divorced . Congratulations . [Both_laugh] Okay . Wow . We continue with an exercise called awareness . It's designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have differences in . As we read off some statements , we want you to move to the other side of the lawn if you agree with what that statement says . If you disagree , stay put . Mike , you want to kick us off ? Thank you , father . You ready ? "" I always squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom of the tube . "" [Both_laugh] I guess . Uh , what if you buy toothpaste that comes in that upright pump thingy ? Well , be thankful that you have one less thing to argue about . Okay , you can go back to your starting point . "" I prefer red wine to white wine . "" "" I like to vacation alone sometimes .

"" Going to church regularly is important to me . "" Okay , try and recall when you and your fianc ? are on opposite sides . Those may be areas to discuss . I mean , obviously , toothpaste is not as important as how many kids you want . Okay , that'll be it for today . I've been going to church . [Birds_squawking] Hi , Emma . [Chuckles] Oh , thank you for the invite tonight , but , um , I'm actually meeting up with this guy I went to college with . My mother thinks I should go . She said it would be good medicine for me to talk to somebody who knew me way back when . [Chuckles] I don't know . I should probably just blow it off . I don't really feel like good company these days , and from what I recall , neither was he . Oh , yeah , good idea . [Laughs] Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Okay . Talk to you tomorrow . Bye . [Ringing] [Beep] Dom , it's roddy , man . I don't even know where the hell I am right now . I was at the javits center doing demos , and my bag with all my shit got ripped off . My fucking wallet , my keys , my laptop just gone . Uh , I was doing a demo for that douche-bag sales guy Craig derno . He said he was gon na watch my bag , but he did not , and now I'm stranded . So , please . Uh , I've tried to call Melissa , but she's at class till late night , so I'm walking to your place , man . Deb , I've been with you every Sunday for the last year and a half . During the week . I've been going during the week . When ? Most days . Most ? Yeah , lately . For how long have you been doing this ? About six ... about eight weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . [Hard-rock_music_playing] [Knock_on_door] Yeah ! Coming ! Oh , Kevin . Roddy . Hey . Oh , you making lasagna ? Uh ... R-roddy ? So , dom just lent you his keys , even after the Christmas dust-up ? I'm helping a friend lay down some demos in Brooklyn . You don't have one of those fake rocks that you hide a key in ? No . Uh , I have a brother-in-law who has a spare key somewhere , but at this point , I'll probably just wait till Melissa's acting class lets out and then head back with her . Yeah , what time is that ? 11:00 . Mm . On a Friday night ? Dude , don't poke the bear . Trust me ... I am already overchafed about the situation . Hey , who's that chippy you got coming over ? Just a friend from college . I'll lend you 20 bucks for a bus back to Jersey . I 'd have you stay , but I'm just not sure that I got enough for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , every day that I asked you how your day was , never once did you say , "" I spent "" it in church . "" I don't spend the day . I-I go to mass . I-I walked by the church one day and I went in and I found something about the ritual that I really missed , something that I had when I was a kid and a teenager . I went to a jesuit college even . Yeah , but hold on . This might be all easier to choke down if I 'd observed your religious re-awakening in incremental portions , instead of having it , you know , thrust on me here at catholic camp . I mean , come on , Deb . I thought we were on the same page . I'm sorry I sprung it on you . I ... Do you want to leave ? Not without you . Are you sure ? Deb , stop saying that , okay ? I'm here , I'm participating , I'm doing all the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m reading what I wrote , am I not ? You are . I want to go to bed on my deluxe 3-inch mattress in my warm and cozy four-star dormitory . Hey . Man . What ? She was finished . Look , I'm sorry about your divorce . Well , you can't convince someone to fix a mistake if they don't think that they've made one . Debatable . You know why my marriage works ? I-I'm becoming more and more intrigued . Because I am blind to the alternative . Still here , still here , still here , still here , still here . I love you . [Beep] You see , it's way too easy to leave somebody nowadays , you know ? Friends of friends , families , everyone everywhere ... everyone is way too understanding of other people's , you know , reasons to leave . You can't judge other people's ... oh , sure you can . You do . We all do . Most people just don't do it out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a good old dosage of some out-loud , full-frontal condemnation in this world . It works . Take my buddy freitsel from umass . He got married a while ago . I went , you know , and I listened to the priest give a homily about how the guests at the wedding were witnesses , but , more importantly , they were sentinels . You know , we are standing guard over that wedded couple . You know , we got the watch , and we are on watch forever . So , last summer , freitsel calls . You know , he says he's having some trouble with bridget ... That's his wife's name ... you know , and ... but , you know , friction , you know , kind of hinting that it might be unfixable . So I'm like , "" oh , buddy , you "" know , hang in there , man . "" It's gon na be all right . "" You know , the usual . But I told dom , and dom's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm like , "" why ? "" And he said , "" go be a sentinel . "" And he was right . Boom ! I drive over to freitsel's place , I sit him down , and I said , "" I can not let you do this . "" You can not give up . "" I owe you this . "" Who wants coffee ? I'll get it . And he's like ... he's like , "" hey , roddy , lay off , man . I'm only human . "" I'm like , "" you're only human ? ! "" So what ? You're only required to work it out if you're a klingon ? Only Mr . Spock's got to dig "" deep ? "" I says , "" guy , your humanity is "" not in dispute here . "" Your humanity is the problem . "" You really got this judging thing down . Look , I'm just saying ... you know , at first , he was resistant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stayed . And now they are thriving . Thriving . [Echoing] Thriving . Hey , uh , are you getting a wi-fi signal down here ? Nope . I'm typing some notes out tonight . Is ... is there gon na be a test ? That is a cool blouse . Oh , thank you . I wasn't sure how to dress . Yeah , I thought it might be dressy , but it's kind of like summer camp . For Jesus freaks . I like it . I mean , some of it's kind of hard , but I feel like it's making us closer . Well , I feel like I'm a grown-up , and it's all a little too instructive and rah-rah for me . Oh , could I borrow some of your ... Yeah . Mm-hmm . Dental floss . Thank you . You're welcome . You know , I'm getting a lot out of it , too . I feel closer to my fianc ? . Hey , uh , dom ? Philip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , thanks . We could really take some money from these jokers . I'm good . Okay . [Chuckles] Are you catholic ? No , but my fianc ? is , so I'm dealing . He promised me reciprocity-free oral if I made it through . Whatever . Forced conversation is not my bag . And neither are these Halloween decorations hanging everywhere . I mean , what kind of sick shit is this ? I get it ... he ... he died on the cross for our sins . Awesome . I don't need to be haunted by his blood and guts hanging out everywhere . [Knock_on_door] Tracy , are you in there ? I'll be there in a second , Chad . Geez ! I'll be in the car . Are you okay ? What happened ? [Sighs] My fianc ? keeps saying he doesn't know why he signed up for this . He doesn't know why we can't sleep in the same bed . We're both adults . And he is miserable . [Breathes_deeply] And so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from okay . We can leave if we want to ? [Snoring] There's a church on 82nd street that Lindsay told me about . Wait , wait , wait . When did church come back into the equation ? You've suffered through enough of our friends's weddings in churches . What's one more ? Especially if it's gon na alleviate some of the stress of planning . Look , it's not as easy as , "" hey , let us use your church for free . "" There are rules . I mean , they have this program called pre-cana , where they ... They basically need to approve you . It actually sounded kind of nice . They ... they have this retreat called engagement encounter . [Chuckles] We get to go away for the weekend . An entire weekend ? [Snoring_continues] [Sighs] [Crickets_chirping] [Snoring_continues] Dom . I went to leave you a note , and , um ... You found my journal and you asked , "" what would Jesus do ? "" Do you want to be with her instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word "" could . "" "" Could "" as in you wanted to or "" could "" as in if the circumstances were different ? Unbelievable . Do you want the circumstances to be different ? No . You can be honest with me . When have I not been honest with you ? These things that you wrote ... I was doing my three pages a day . I was flushing it out . I was putting it on the page unfiltered , like the book that you gave me suggested . I'm just interested where these thoughts about her came along and when you thought it was okay to write them in your journal ? ! Look , I'm here with you , okay ? What good is being here with me when you're writing about some slut you work with . She's not a slut . You're defending her ? No . I'm being honest . She made a pass at you . She tried to . I wasn't there . Well , it seems like you were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I don't know . You tell me , Nancy drew . Just before easter . Okay , can we step ... it's documented , babe ! Can we just move away from the building ? No , it is documented , okay ? Everybody from work had Thursday night drinks . I pushed her away . After you lured her to make a move . What are you talking about ? You made her a mix . Yes , I made her a mix of tunes that I listen to at work . Don't you see how I can interpret that as cultivating intimacy ? No , I didn't think of your interpretation , because I was like , "" here are those tunes . "" And she was like , "" thanks . "" So , while I'm at home trying to find my next shitty temp job , you're off ... what ? Road-testing my replacement ? I'm telling you ... I'm not . Then what was with the bath oils ? Oh , this is insane ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see how that's kind of fucked up ? I was her secret Santa . So buy her a pad of post-it notes , buy her , you know , a new ace bandage , something that ... That physical therapists buy for one another , not some Spanish-fly sex kit for her to rub all over her breasts . I thought it was a nice gift . You liked the one's my mom bought for you . You bought some for Karen . You talked about it for 15 minutes over dinner with Bob and Stacy . You said you loved it . So ? Yeah , I loved it because I was amazed at how something so simple could make me feel so relaxed and cared for and girly . And then we had an amazing night of lovemaking after you drew a bath for me to try the bath oils in . And then you go and buy her the same fucking bath oils ? ! She ... she just started working there , okay ? I found her in the stairwell crying because her boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you to marry me . I was feeling so lucky . But for her , it was shaping up to be a pretty shitty holiday season . So when I picked her name out of a hat the next day , I decided it would be nice for me to buy her something nice . So I went to Duane reade and dropped $12 and spread some holiday cheer . So you gave her a shoulder to cry on , some advice on love , a mix tape to listen to while she rubs her bath oils all over her naked body , and she adds up these gestures as an invitation to fall for you , which she does , and then she lets this be known , all gooey-eyed and ... and gushy with her lips parted , which sends you swooning and swirling and ... she was crying in the stairwell . Oh , my God ! And I bet she was all "" sniffle "" , "" sniffle , "" and you were all , "" there , there . "" Okay , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You're putting things together , and they don't go together that way . But things you wrote ! Yes , the things I wrote ! Whatever was in my journal had a right to be there , and you had none . Uh ... Take $20 . No , man . I don't want to take your strip-club stash . [Both_laugh] All right , seriously , we're just gon na go for a walk . You okay ? I'm fine . I'm gon na go down to where her acting classes are . She usually gets ... [Yawning] Coffee around the corner . Um ... Her friends ... oh , God , her friends . [Chuckles] They're so self-centered . They never ask me a question about how I am doing , but alas , yet again , I am in a situation where I have to suck it up and deal , so ... Thank you for dinner . Yeah . And thank you for conversation . Sometimes misfortune leads to a nice night , right ? That's a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful people . Oh . You're adorable . You're the most adorable of the two . Okay , bye . [Crickets_chirping] You still wear that necklace what's-his-fuck gave you , right ? What has that got to ... because we're discussing cultivating thoughts of intimacy . My wearing this necklace is not cultivating thoughts of intimacy with Gary Thompson . Talk to Gary Thompson ? I saw him a couple months ago . Oh , really ? Where ? Church ? I saw him outside a diner . So , why didn't you mention that to me ? "" Oh , hey , I had lunch with Gary Thompson . "" We didn't have lunch . Oh , have lunch , split a burger , throw back some brews , have a soulful visit . I had a coffee . He's still friends with a bunch of my friends from Georgetown . He is a dirtbag who stole money from you , and yet , you still feel the need to cozy up and reminisce . Hey , congratulations , by the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here doing a recording . Oh , for a friend for free . What ? Like I'm painting ? For years of art classes , preparing me for anything but a desk job , and what am I doing ? You're in human resource . You are a resource for humans to reference their humanity . Yeah , well , I thought it was just a phase , and now , seven years later , somehow a phase has become my life . You've been through a lot . Other people have been through worse . It matches the bracelet you bought for me . Before I knew fuck-face bought it for you five years ago . It's just a necklace . And it's just a journal , thoughts . Thoughts come and go . I mean , do you pray out loud at the kitchen table for me to listen in ? No ? Why ? Why all the secrets , huh ? This is different . This is different . If you think this matters to me ... I mean , you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could give a shit . It's fake ! Well , don't Chuck the bracelet , ' cause that's real . How real are your feelings for her ? Words on a page . Words buried by other words , words you may not have had a chance to get to tonight , words about us , about our wedding , about how much of a good thing I have with you . Did you read that ? That's in there , too . Did you read what I wrote yesterday before we came to this godforsaken place ? Didn't you read all the things I wrote about you ? How we doing over here ? Oh , fucking phenomenal , father . Thank you . Nine years . Back of a burger king . I welled up . You walked off . Back of a burger king . How sad is that ? It was a long time ago . It was a nightmare . Torch-carrying fool . I had a boyfriend . You always had a boyfriend . [Laughs] We were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is my one-step recovery program , apologizing to you face-to-face for putting you in that situation ... And then abandoning our friendship when I didn't get what I wanted in return . And ... I was an ass . It has impacted me more than you could possibly know . And ... Still . I'm sorry . There . I said it . God . Of course , it took me nine years . I was married for half of those nine years . I wasn't always up for chatting , especially about the past . Hey , should we get more alcohol ? Actually , I'm trying to cut back . Ugh . I tried to keep a straight face . [Laughs] But I really like alcohol . [Laughs] Can we start with a prayer ? No , I'm not in the mood for praying . And , honestly , father ... You ... I mean , not you personally , but the collective you ... have been fucking up my shit for a long fucking time . I'm really sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I'm sorry . I'm sorry for swearing . I-I-i don't mean any disrespect . Thank you for taking some time . How have we been fucking up your shit ? Making me go to confession when I was 8 . Let's start there . What sin does an 8-year-old need to confess ? You 'd be surprised . When I was an altar boy , I dropped a communion wafer and got cuffed so hard by the priest that my ear rang for two days . Dom , he's trying to help . No , just ... just ... just so we're clear . You can't drop them , but you can put them in your mouth and chew them . I can understand how bewildering that could be ... no , no , no . Bewildering is our parish priest telling me , when I was 12 , that my father's death was my cross to bear for the rest of my life . Jesus only had to carry the cross for a couple hours , and he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like that prize package . Faith is a struggle . Thi is a struggle . This is a struggle . I-I-i came here because I thought it was the right thing to do , but now it is clear that it was absolutely the wrong thing to do , because we were getting along great before the church came into it . And you people , with your , uh ... Identifying of obstacles . You fucking create obstacles . I left a note in his journal . It was supposed to be a surprise . Oh , yeah , it was a real surprise , all right . [Sighs] You know , father , I had faith when I was a kid ' cause I ate what was put on my plate . And then , well , you know , loved one gets struck down by a Chevy impala , and you don't even get a drunk driver to blame . Just some icy roads , bad luck , and a dead dad . And it makes no sense . But you people tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in paradise , that he planned it that way . You told me to find purpose in the pain . Losing a parent can be painful . And I didn't tell you this to give you some sort of "" aha "" moment , some revelation to unlock the mystery of me . My dad died . I bummed out . I got over it . Losing your faith is not uncommon ... I didn't lose my faith . It didn't deliver what it said it would . And upon further reflection , I decided to treat it the same way it treated me ... with contempt . You tell me to pray to God when things are good , pray to God when things are bad , and be happy with whatever answer he gives you . Here's what I've learned so far . Everything is arbitrary . Most things aren't easy . Fucked-up shit happens to a lot of people , so just pray it doesn't happen to you . But what does all this have to do with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in an ever-changing religion that has cut and pasted as it sees fit , but she can't place her faith in me . And all I've done to prove to you that I am dedicated , to show you that my actions speak louder than words . Why can't she ... why can't she have faith in me ? I just don't know when I became the type of person who gets in these situations . You felt something real and you followed it . I know that sounds like acting-school garbage , but it just happens to be true . What this is , what we have ... I've never had it before . Everything you say makes him sound like a jerk . I haven't told you the ways in which he's been nice . When has he ever been nice ? He loved me when I was ugly . How many TV shows do you think you need to see to know that you shouldn't cheat on your wife at home , because she just might walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and they're going at it . And at first , I couldn't even assemble the pictures . Then I screamed , made a scene , took all of her things , and threw them in the hallway . I smashed his laptop on the floor , and I knew he didn't back that shit up , like , ever . And then I was like , "" what the "" fuck ? "" That was my moment of eloquence . My entire marriage had been upended , and all I could come up with was , "" what the fuck ? "" What 'd he say ? He shrugged . How do you go from a vow to a shrug ? I can hardly profess to know you both . The fact that you're here , talking this out , even shouting this out , rather than running ... Well , that , to me , is a manifestation of God's presence . Rely on it . There's a lot of muscularity to your words ... from both of you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , you know , sometimes it is . Be gentle with one another , look for the good and noble in one another , look for the reason why you want to get married . Write it out , shout it out , share it . It's okay to try hard . It's okay to feel like you're trying hard . You know , in the mass , we talk about how Jesus wanted to carry some of our struggle and our hurt . Invite him to do so . I hope I see you tomorrow . [Door_opens] , closes Debbie . [Paper_thuds] I'm sorry . I'm dragging down the whole night . Oh , but you're doing it so well . [Laughs] My mom says that I have to stop it with the angst . She considers anything that she doesn't want to have to listen to as angst . Your husband betrayed you . [Chuckles] If processing a heartbreak's now considered angst , then there's no hope for any of us . [Laughs] But , uh ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid shit that I need to deal with . Love ain't stupid shit . Wanting something with another person that is lasting and true is an elemental yearning . I think a friend of mine told me that , recently , even . But it's true , right ? It's not stupid shit . I just want to meet a good guy . Like , it doesn't matter if he's from a good family . I'll start my own good family , but I can't start without the guy . [Chuckles] And I'm not saying that I only identify myself in juxtaposition to a guy . I just ... I like guys . [Laughs] I-I'm a fan of the whole guy-girl thing . [Both_laugh] I'm not , like , trolling for a rhodes scholar ... just a guy , just a grown-man guy , a guy that I don't have to support and pay his student loans while he flakes out and has sex with other people , a consistent guy who does his guy thing and doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy who's nice and ... Occasionally attentive . Hi . [Chuckles] I am so in love with you . I am so fucking in love with you that I can not contain myself . And I know that you are wounded and hurting and fucked up still over this guy , but I have spent the whole entire night staring at you , and the only reason that I came down here was to get lost in your face and try to do what I just did . So if you think that I'm an ass for doing that , I will totally understand . * blow out the candles on your cake , little darling * * mother is here now don't you shake , little darling * * ain't no bad girl gon na take my little darling from where he belongs * * ooh , ooh-ooh , ooh . Debbie ... Baby , I love you . Despite above and beyond all this , I love you . Let's go home . Let's just get out of here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started going to church "" because I had doubts about marrying you , doubts about myself in a marriage , bringing into it what's needed , doubts about this being the right thing , if we're right together . And I read your journal because I wanted to know if you had the same doubts , because maybe if you did , I-I 'd know that we 'd be okay because we 'd need each other to build on what we love about one another and ... and cast any doubts away . I'm all upside down and I couldn't decipher whether that was ... that was real fear or just jitters , and ... and I "" didn't know how to say that . "" You wanted ... you wanted confirmation on your doubt ? To see if it was shared ? That's why you read it ? Just to see if you were scared or uncertain at all . You started praying because , some months ago , you realized that you might not love me ? I prayed because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fairy godmother . If you don't love me , you can't pray yourself into it . I wasn't trying to do that . I know that I'm not the only one that you might think is awesome , and maybe she was more awesome ... oh , she's not more awesome than you . [Laughs] This stupid book . This stupid fucking book is not me . What have I not done ? Tell me . What am I not showing you ? I have a good job . I have a good place for us . I have good plans . I have a good heart . Just tell me . You doubt us . You doubt us and you took this journal and you used to hang the responsibility on my shoulders . You wanted to know if I have doubts , so you go looking for doubt and you ... you find some ramblings and you call those ramblings truth and you dismiss the truth that I pledged to you . And then you have this ... this weepy revelation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what ? Take the car . [Keys_jingle] I'll find my own way home . [Crying] [Door_slams] Dom . Uh , I'm sorry about last night . Oh , it's cool . I wish I could say it was the alcohol , but it isn't . It's ... no , I-it's fine . Really . Okay . [Both_laugh] Let's get this shit over with . [Crickets_chirping] [Knock_on_door] [Knocking_continues] Hey , dom . Thank God . I wasn't expecting you . Uh ... What is he doing here ? His stuff got stolen . But I need to crash . Where's Deb ? Dom , hi . It's been a while . Hey , congratulations . It's really exciting . Oh . Hi . Oh , I'm sorry . Did I wake you ? No . Kevin , what are you doing in . New York City ? Hey , Melissa . Um , doing some demos with a friend , the music thing . Oh . Hi . Hi . Uh , I 'd like to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I know . I ... we have to keep our phones off in class . We can't even put it on vibrator , so I forgot to put it back on . And then I went to a friend's house and fell asleep . You know , just a really rough week . Rehearsing . I'm exhausted . But I woke up . Here I am . Don't do this , Mel . I would have called to tell you I was coming , but my phone died . Uh , we're gon na head to . Betsy's . Uh , it was nice meeting you . Well , at least you're getting something from your acting guru , ' cause it's definitely not the ability to act . Don't turn on me for this . I need you to not be this kind of person , Melissa . Not you . Don't be this person right now . I just want what everyone else has . I want something real . I want what you have with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . We'll give ... I'll give you a call in the morning . [Door_closes] Oh ! Get up , roddy . Why would you do that ? I fell asleep at Rachel's house . Let's go . All right , hold on . Hey , dom , aren't you supposed to be at that retreat ? Yeah , I left . Oh . I hear you . [Chuckles] I finally got to blaze a trail for you . [Chuckles] Yeah , come on . It's late . Let's go home . Where were you ? In class . Till 2:30 ? Well , I had a cup of coffee with Rachel and I fell asleep . You're lucky I woke up . Melissa , my shit got ripped off . I needed my wife to bail me out . I'm here . Yeah , seven hours later . Can you guys just go ? Just go . Where the hell were you ? [Indistinct_shouting] [Door_closes] I'm sick of this acting thing . Every Friday night .

Further out trees were felled because ... the blast wave was moving closer to the horizontal when it reached them . So what happened ? This is the expert . Some people think it was an asteroid made of rock or metal . Some say it was a comet made of dust and ice . Just a couple of hours later it would have destroyed Moscow or St . Petersburg . Every living being in a 25 mile radiusjust would have been killed instantly . Yeah . In living history this , the Tunguska event , stands out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the human race ... well i ? s a real possibility . This is Gant , yeah . Hey Frank ... I ? s NASA . No we've been out in the woods for the last three days , we haven't heard of anything , why , what happened ? I need you to contact my boyfriend , I can't get through to him on his mobile . He was meant to meet me at Shannon Airport . Well ... maybe the networks are_just down , so ... No , my mobile works , so does hers . We were ten feet above the runway when the wave hit . We could have aquaplaned into Shannon . - Are you okay to report ? - Yeah . Well they evacuated the airport didn't they ? Look I , I'm sure that he , he got out in time . Really I ... I'm sorry , excuse me . No , no , I'm going , I'm gon na try and get back out there today . We'll get a camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean at speeds of over 500 miles per hour . ... slamming into coastal areas and racing inland with little or no warning . The wave heights have been reported as high as 120 feet , ... a surging mass of water engulfing an area over 3,000 square miles . Officials in Dublin have estimated the initial death toll ... at over 10,000 . The President will be issuing a full statement in the next few hours . Our initial data strongly suggests that the Tsunami was caused by a near earth object ... impacting into the Atlantic Ocean ... 300 miles off the Irish Coast . Over 30,000 people are now homeless and hundreds of thousands of people remain missing . NASAwill be launching a full enquiry into this event . We're sending out a specialist team from ... N.E.O . , our Near Earth Object Programme , to determine the source and composition of the impact object . What we're talking about here ... is either an asteroid , which is essentially a rock or metal based body , or a comet , which is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't yet know exactly where it came from . Sir , with all our satellite technology and radar telescopes , how come nobody saw this coming ? Within 24 hours we were on a plane to Ireland desperate to find the answer . We were to be met by Professor Brendan Kelly , eminent astro physicist from Queen's College . - Hi , Professor Kelly ? - Oh right , Brendan will do . - Josh Hayden . - Hi , Josh Neil Gant . Hayden and Gant eh ? You sound like a couple of outlaws . - Or lawyers . - Yeah same thing in my book . This is Tam Ly our resident Tsunami expert . Sent by the Gods . In fact by the University of Tokyo . You're not from Japan ? No , no , I'm originally from Vietnam , I did my MSC in America , Santa Cruz . Brendan's expertise was in ... the microscopic particles left overfrom the creation of our solar system . You know the thing about dust ... Yeah , dust is so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . You mean the accumulation of dust ? I know what I mean . I'm the King of Dust ! When do you think we'll be able to get down to the coast ? Ah access is restricted at the minute , we'll go to Shannon tomorrow , see if we can get authorisation . I'll put a call in , get NASAto pull some strings for us . Right , make yourself at home . We've been trying to collate some incoming evidence , seismic data , barometric readings . Lot of stuff coming in from India . You know we're gon na have to give this N.E.O . A name . Well , isn't that thejob of the Minor Planet Centre ? Oh they're down in Massachusetts , anyway we need a standby , something a little more media friendly than ... ' un - No I was thinking of ... What ? - Rockall . Rockall . I ? s the sea area the comet hit , i ? s a little Island about 250 miles north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a good idea Brendan . Here you go . Hey , where did you get these images ? American Military Reconnaissance , but we're gon na need a lot more data than this if we're gon na get a handle on Rockall's trajectory . Find out where it came from ... and why we missed it . All we had had was an approximate impact site in t what we needed was an accurate trajectory to tell us where it came from . - Anyone for curry ? - No thanks Brendan . Forget fish , curry's the thing for your brain . Project Rockall ... I ? s all in the turmeric you see . I ? s full of curcumin , which is an anti-oxidant , so now you know . Get the curry down you , ward off that mental decay . You should have some Josh . That was a flight attendant on 419 , the plan that outran the wave , well she's got the footage on her cell phone ... but she's heading back to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go . - Tha ? s ourterritory . - Yeah , yeah . Here we go . Oh we can get a time stamp on that . - And tha ? s good ? - Oh tha ? s very good . Now is there any chance we could get the flight path data ... to find out exactly where you were when you took t Yeah , sure . If we can get a fix on your exact position we can cross-reference that with the light in this ... and then i ? ll help us get a sense of the trajectory of the N.E.O . And then you can find out where it came from right ? Exactly . Have you got wireless connect on this cell phone ? Yeah you do . Great its worked . Marcie , thank you very much , you've been very helpful . So , you guys are like spacemen ? We're not trained in aeronautics but yeah we're part of NASA . Now N.E.O . Why i ? s at the heart of the space industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Matrix ' ? You are so cool ! I'm kidding . Charlie , how are you ? - Brendan ... - Any news of the family ? No , nothing , nothing yet . Come here , let me show you . - Excuse me , we're from ... - Just one second . ... we're from NASA , we , we need immediate access to the disaster zone , there's some permits here for us apparently . Anyone know anything about permits for NASA ? Be here all day . Yes . We need another airlift ASAP but ... the main supply route is blocked , so if you can't get a runway slot we'll have to do the food drop by parachute . Excuse me sir , are you from FEMA ? I ... well yeah , I'm just helping out with the International Disaster Response ... Neil Gant , with NASA . Adam right ? You care to help out a compatriot ? Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy , secured us permits within the hour , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyse the debris left by the Tsunami before ... it was disturbed by the clear up operation . To the trained eye this wreckage held vital clues to the origins of the N.E.O . That had so taken us by surprise . We'll build a map of the debris pattern , we'll learn more about the wave . And we'll start to get a handle on Rockall . Three days ago those rocks were at the bottom of the sea . You know , 1,000 years from now people will come here like this was the Irish Stonehenge , and they'll be thinking "" how did they get the rocks up there ? "" huh ? Cliff height is about 72 feet so we know ... the wave was at least that high as it hit the coast . Maybe they'll think of it as a monument to 8/8 . The wave spilled overthe cliff and scattered the debris across a vast area . The scatter pattern and the inclination of once vertical structures would ... tell us the precise strength and direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There's someone here , there's someone in here ! I've got her head . We've got ta get to a hospital . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven ... Neil , there's no pulse . Neil , i ? s too late . There's an e-mail from that air hostess , she's managed to get hold of the radar data and the exact flight co-ordinates . We need to get it into the mapping programme . - I'll do it when we get back . - Huh ? - I'll do it when we get back . - Fine . Tsunami death toll rises ... Turn it off ! ... authorities struggling to cope with the number of bodies . - Churches and schools are being used - Please . - As temporary mortuaries . - Thank you . I ? s been four days since the Tsunami hit . The roads are full of mud and dirt left behind as the sea water retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , timbers and other debris ... that the search for survivors continues . Stay here tonight . Wouldn't it be betterto head back ? I don't mind driving , - we can be in Dublin by ... - Josh , we'll stay here tonight . Go easy on him , his father lived here . I'm looking for Bryan Kelly . Daddy . We let this thing through you know , we let it through ... Neil ! No-one could have predicted this . Ourjob is to watch objects in space . If i ? s not our responsibility , whose is it ? Oh Neil , get real . There's a lot less dust than I expected , if it was an asteroid it was no more than 50 metres across . And an asteroid that small would never reach the ocean ? No . And even if it did , it would never have had enough powerto ... generate a Tsunami with such a high amplitude , I mean the wave height measurements were fartoo large for an asteroid of only 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been much largerthan 50 metres , two , three hundred and ... even if it exploded on impact there would have been relatively little dust ... Because unlike an asteroid i ? s composed mainly of ice . It would have been moving much fasterthan an asteroid too , you know , between 20 and 35 miles per second . Definitely enough muscle to cause a Tsunami . Yeah . Yeah . Le ? sjust match that with the co-ordinates of ... Marcie's sighting and the satellite images ... and le ? s see if we get ... - Here she comes . - We get the point of impact . Oh yeah , notjust that ... Now if we trace the trajectory backwards ... we should be able to find out where she came from , look the orbit is practically grazing the sun , tha ? s why we missed her . A sling-shot back to there ... just to the left Betelgeuse off Orion's shoulder , - Oh gotcha - tha ? s where she came from . From the outset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the impact of a , a near-earth object , a , an N.E.O . We've discovered that this was a small long period comet , approximately 200 metres in diameter , probably formed in the very early solar system , even before the planets existed , and now , now we know where it came from . Why wasn't the comet spotted in time ? Well there are teams of astronomers around the world whose ... sole purpose is finding and tracking N.E.O . ' s ... but sadly this particular one couldn't have been predicted by them or anyone else ... Why is that ? Well because the comet approached earth at an acute angle , very small , obscured by the glare of the sun . Like fighter pilots driving out of the sun to ... surprise an enemy , impossible to see until i ? s too late . So another one could sneak up on us at any time ? No , no . No . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bear witness to , but sounds a bit odd , but it was a privilege , a tragic one , with ... terrible consequences but a privilege nevertheless . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . The scientific global community will continue to ... monitorthe comet for years to come but ... thanks to the work of Project Rockall the foundation of that research is now in place , and with it hopefully some sense of closure forthe families of the people ... who so tragically lost their lives in this natural disaster . So that was how it started . The biggest N.E.O . Impact since Tunguska and we 'd missed it . How could we have known that 8/8 wasjust the beginning ? The worst was yet to come . - We did ourjob , Neil . - Did we ? Yes . Our remit is to find objects over one kilometre in size . Rockall was 200 metres and we weren't even looking for it . May be we should have been . We don't have those sort of resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll see you at the gate . - Neil ? Hey . - Hey . Are you heading home ? Yeah , the projec ? s all wrapped up so ... they got you working again already huh ? Yeah , the Dublin route . I ? s kinda quiet but tha ? ll change . - You look beat . - Yeah . - Do you wan na walk with me ? - Yeah . I'm just curious , what is your star sign ? Oh ... I don't . Oh okay , well what do we know ? You have a big sense of responsibility , you take everything very personally , and I would say that you are kinda cautious . I would say tha ? s about the stupidest thing I've ever heard . And I would say that you are a Scorpio . Wow ! I am impressed . So ... how about you ? Pisces . Really ? What are they like ? Oh we're warm-hearted , idealistic , sensitive ... Just the good traits huh ? Oh God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tends to be balanced out by our ideal partners , Cancer or ... Scorpio . This is me , so ... Oh ... maybe I'll see you around ? Yeah , I hope so . Hey who knows , maybe i ? s in the stars ? Ground Control to Major Tom ! Are you receiving me spaceman ? I'm sorry I got ta do this , i ? s really important . I'll see you in the morning . No , take a look . Orion is amazing tonight . Betelgeuse , i ? s as red as a berry . Betelgeuse ? I ? s a star where Rockall came from . Welcome to my world . Since 8 it seemed every astronomer//on the planet was hun all sightings found their way to my inbox . No matter how trivial I had to log them , calculate the trajectories and ... estimate potential impact dates . Expert opinion was that it would not be happen in our lifetime , but i had to be ensure that . I've got something to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Science ' has accepted it for publication next month . Oh and if you flip it overtha ? s a list of Universities ... who want us to , to deliver a key note lecture . Josh I have a backlog of a hundred unmapped N.E.O . ' s here ... any one of which could be headed our way so I real don't see how glad-handing universities makes it to the top of our To Do list . I've got Kimberly Marshall on hold . Do you want me to put herthrough ? No , no , I'll take it in my office . Read it ! I ? s your work . Unbelievable . Unbelievable . A new sighting from Australia , an N.E.O . Discovered by two astronomers Gibden and Bell . Our sentry programme calculated a rough trajectory and impact date . The date was chillingly familiar . A second sighting , the same N.E.O . And then a third . Looks like i ? s only gon na be famous from the lectures out here . Seriously the good news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ... - Hey Josh . - What N.E.O . Does ... Look at the date of approach , August 8th 2009 . What ? We're getting different observations on the same comet chain , 15 sightings so far , so put it all into SENTRY to get a date closest to approach , and what comes out ? August 8th , same date as the Irish impact . Which means that one year on , earth could be right back in the firing line again . This is comet Rockall's trajectory and ... this is what we've got so far on the new sightings potential comet chain . Now what I wan na do is get images from the Lincoln telescope and ... reports from Russia , Australia ... Fine , yeah fine . Run with the precovery . Try and keep it in perspective , this is conjecture , not fact . Hey , hey , hey ... ah ... ah ... I , I , I know we were gon na go to Vegas this weekend , I ... I got ta go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Catalina Sky Survey , Arizona . Oh ! Arizona ! Wow . Yeah , I'm really sorry , I just ... I've really got ta I ? s fine . Lets go . Oh you don't wan na come , i ? s like an eight hundred mile round trip . Well ... I tell you what , I will drive and you can pay the speeding fines . So what happens at Catalina ? Precovery . I ? s a little technical . I understood the Matrix Trilogy Neil , indulge me . - This is it ? - Yeah . This is where the guardians of the planet watch over us ? Is there a problem ? No , no , no , no . I wasjust expecting something a little , you know , cooler , a little more ' X Men ' . This is it . This is a photographic log of the constellation of Orion . - I ? s divided up into sections . - I get it . The computer stores images of the last few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet chain before today , before it really registered as a moving object . - Precovery ? - Precovery . Right ... The hard thing is telling the comet from the stars . I ? sjust one tiny speck of light amongst ... thousan but we've got one thing going for us ... stars don't move , N.E.O . ' s do . If you take pictures of exactly the same part of the sky but weeks apart then flip between them , find a startha ? s moved , it ain't a star , i ? s an N.E.O . What time is it ? Just to the left of Betelgeuse off the shoulder of Orion , exactly the same place as Rockall came from . Neil ? It was a long period comet probably ten to 12 miles in size originally , the same as Haley's comet , probably broke up around 1,000 years ago and formed a chain . Now what hit Ireland was a fragment ... that got a little bit ahead probably due to out-gassing , and what we're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back around ... in the same orbit and intersecting with us again . Tha ? s a lot of probably's . Probably . And you're talking massive error margins . Your mapping's rudimentary and there simply isn't enough data yet . Well I'm , I'm , I'm getting it , but Josh we're looking at a Torino scale 6 here . Oh , but you're using a scale tha ? s only been used for asteroids and relating it to comets . They're completely different animals , you know that . Comets are way more unpredictable , outgassing for a start . You can't talk about Torino 6 . We can not afford to get this wrong Josh , you know what happened last time . Josh , I want you to take this threat seriously , forward my report to Lampanelli and get NASA behind us on this ... Neil , Neil you keep doing this to me . What report ? You've got some half-assed daubings on my office wall , you're a mess man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false alarm , we will monitorthe situation no , yes , yes we will monitor it but what we will not do ... is go off half-cocked and ... look like a bunch of amateurs . Is that all you care about these days Josh ? How you look . You need to get some sleep , and take a shower while you're at it . In fact ... take the rest of the day off . I ? s not a suggestion . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . 65 million years ago , an asteroid or comet ... impacted the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico , creating 100 mile wide crater . The KT Extinction Event . I ? s estimated the impact of the force ... was equivalent to six million Hiroshima bombs . It created a vast dust cloud which blocked the light of the sun and prevented photosynthesis for many years . The KT Extinction Event was the death knell forthe majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Gant it could all happen again . Breaking newsjust in from the United States , a NASA scientist has reported that ... comet Rockall , which caused such devastation in Western Ireland , may have been part of a chain of comets ... which could collide with planet earth in eight months time . Switch the telly on . Professor Gant has named the comet chain Gibden-Bell ... afterthe two astronomers who first discovered it ... Reports of another possible comet impact have sparked fear in the worl ? s media . Stocks crashed in the blackest day for Wall Street in living memory ... Interest rates ... soared and Banks closed their doors ... as trading ceased across the globe . You'vejust wiped ten billion dollars off the DowJones Index , and now the panic's rippling around the rest of the world . You've embarrassed N.E.O . It looks as if we were covering it up . Weren't we ? Lampinelli called . NASAwants us both in Washington . General Harris has demanded a debrief . Who ? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that General Harris . - Hi Frank . - Morning Josh . The General's ready for you both . I hope you've said your Hail Marys . I'm not interested in the politics of who said what , when or why right now , I just want facts . Is earth in danger of being hit by another comet ? There is a potential threat , yes sir . Our calculations suggest a one percent chance ... of a collision somewhere on the earth's surface . One percent ? You put the fear on everyone on this planet for one percent ? If there was a one percent chance there was a rattlesnake in your back yard , would you let your kids go out and play hide and seek ? We're currently working on predicting the come ? s chain's ellipse , its trajectory , but tha ? s not something we can nail down in a matter of weeks . What are you saying ? The further away the comet chain , the less accurate our predictions . We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle on the comet chain's size and its structure . Okay , I'll back it . Wha ? s the situation with the Japanese and European space agencies ? We're liaising with them now . Good , and I want a report on our response options to this thing . We've got ta be ready . I'm gon na need to put a team together sir . Whatever you need . Looks like you gentlemen have your work cut out . Today NASA announced the first tracking of a cosmic probe to ... investigate Gibden-Bell , the comet chain scientists ... fear could be on a direct collision path with earth . - Hey welcome . - How are ya ? Yeah , good . Back at N.E.O . We set about refining our calculations for Gibden-Bell's trajectory . As the comet got nearer our calculations improved . It was not good news . Each time the potential comet path narrowed ... it seemed to be honing in on planet earth . Spotlight Voyager Seven , NASA report progress on the preparation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the probe could be_just days from launch . What we're trying to create here is a spread of a Tsunami envelope . If a fragment of Gibden-Bell does hit there's a high probability , it will impact in one of our major oceans . If i ? s a land impact then the dust composition will be critical . For dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . Are these the samples from the Stardust mission ? I'm just trying to see if the fragments we record from Rockall can give us an idea ... - as to the composition , go on take a look . - Oh great , thanks . If a high percentage of those particles contain sulphur ... we could be heading for another Ice Age . So deadly , yet so pretty . Oh gosh they're beautiful . - How are things with Josh ? - Yeah ... If there is an impact this is the bad boy we need to worry about . Roughly a mile in diameter he's about the size of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . If any fragment is gon na impact , it will be this one , the largest of the fragments Gibden-Bell A . Who's gon na tell the General ? As the threat of comet impact increases ... NASA announces that the launch of probe Voyager Seven is imminent . Mission focus will be the largest comet Gibden-Bell A . Anything Neil ? I've been working on the Whipple shoot issue forthe probe , the launch team is saying there's not enough space on the launch vehicle ... but I think i ? s essential if we're gon na protect the probe from comet debris . Wha ? s up with you ? Still working on those radar images from Arecibo . They'll be nothing like the probe can give us but ... worth having a back-up . Arecibo , the most powerful radio telescope on earth . Wishful thinking on Josh's part , the comet chain was still too distant for us to see anything useful . We desperately needed the probe . - D minus ten - Guys , i ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probe for launch . Now their efforts are complete , we have lift-off . Voyager Seven ascends towards the stars , its mission to conduct a thorough analysis of the comet Gibden-Bell . As the likelihood of an impact continues to rise , this essential information will confirmed or denied the possibilies to collision with earth With it go the hopes and fears of all mankind . God speed Voyager Seven . If a comet impacts in the ocean , it will create a Tsunami 20 times the size of the one that hit Ireland , and if it hits the Pacific ... well , we can say goodbye to the whole of the West Coast . The countries of Central America will be devastate as will Japan ... and i ? s no betterforthe Atlantic . We 'd lose every coastal county in New England , Virginia , the Carolinas , Georgia and Florida . The waves produced would annihilate Ireland and the British Isles and cause ... Ireland again eh ? ... and cause chaos in mainland Europe , the Caribbean , North West Africa ... we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions . What if we don't let it hit ? What if we try and deflect it ? Well your man at Imperial College thinks it can be done but ... they're still finessing the figures on the mass to thrust ratios . No I'm not talking about kinetic impact . Given the time frame , a stand-off nuclear explosions are the only viable option . This is a possible solution that ... we could present to General Harris next week . Josh the ... the implications of using thermo nuclear weapons ... I know , but it is an approach tha ? s actually got a chance of working . Give it a read . Le ? s at least try going with this . Well Josh has got a possible solution , but it could make things a whole lot worse . Can't you two broker a ceasefire or something ? You know , forthe sake of mankind ? Well the thing is Josh might be right . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you said that he was wrong . Yeah well there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wha ? s driving me nuts . Nobody's ever been in a situation like this before , i ? s all on us and if we screw up ... we could wind upjust like wiping out the whole planet . Marcie ? You 'd betterfix this Neil . Gentlemen . Professor . The comet chain Gibden-Bell . Now this is the fella which most concerns us . A one mile size fragment we're calling Gibden-Bell A . Ourforecasts now suggest a 60 percent chance of collision . Oh i ? s coming gentlemen and in four months time . Now if you look at the ellipse pattern , you'll see that America's very much in the line of fire , either via a giant Tsunami if the impact occurs in ... either ocean orthrough a direct land strike , which would devastate thousands of square miles . Now here's how we persuade it to go away . Stand off nuclear diversion . A series of nuclear devices will be launched to the comet , programmed to detonate alongside it , far enough away to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one side of the comet causing ... that side to outgas altering its trajectory , thrusting it away from the earth . What model basis did you use ? The Icarus Project developed at M.I.T . In 1967 . That was a , a hypothetical collision with earth by the asteroid 1566 Icarus . But Icarus assumed that they had 15 months for the deflection , you're saying we only have four ? NASA has been preparing a delivery system since the threat was first registered . The plan will require international co-operation , besides American launch bases , we 'd look to use sites in Europe and China . We've already received a pledge from the Russians . Well I presume our French Gowandan base would be suitable , however gentlemen I can not stress enough the time factor here . The schedule is achievable if we move quickly . Oh clearly , clearly time is of the essence ... We can not rush into a nuclear deflection strategy . Right now we have no idea of the stability of the comet , tha ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Gibden-Bell A is unstable and we try to deflect it , it could break up and the cometesimals released would be like multiple re-entry warheads , they would smash into our atmosphere at 160,000 miles an hour . Tha ? s not what the Deep Impact mission found . Comet 9P-Tempel was , well a lot tougherthan we thought . Yeah well what about Shoemaker-Levy 9 ? Jupiter's gravity ... tore it to pieces , it turns out that its structure was weakerthan fresh powder snow . The point is that each one of these N.E.O . ' s is structurally unique , tha ? s a fact . Sorry gentlemen , my colleague Neil Gant , he thinks we have time . I don't . Until we get the results of that probe we can only guess as to the come ? s composition , but one thing is for sure , deflecting a comet is an entirely different proposition than deflecting an asteroid . Icarus was designed to deflect an asteroid , which is made of metal or rock not ... a come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na throw nukes at that ? That is like playing baseball with a water melon ! Neil thank you , tha ? s enough ! Sit down . No , no , no , no . I wan na hearthis . Alright . If this is the blast radius of the comet fragment that ... caused the Tunguska event in Siberia in 1908 ... then this would be Washington DC ... today . If that comet breaks up we're gon na create thousands of projectiles of this kind of powertha could impact anywhere on this planet , London , New York , Paris , Rome ... the destruction globally of multiple impacts would be ... ten times greaterthan that of a single impact to America and ... of course there's no way to predict the impact zone , so no warning , no evacuation , no planning is possible . Just death and destruction on an unimaginable scale , If you're against deflecting the comet , what alternative strategy are you proposing ? America has to take the hit . Are you suggesting we sit back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months preparing in every detail an evacuation strategy . Ten days before impact we will know exactly where i ? s going to hit . We spend those ten days executing the plan . If i ? s gon na hit in the sea then we evacuate the coast , if i ? s gon na hit land then ... we evacuate half the country . We couldn't clear New Orleans in one week for Katrina , and you wan na play musical chairs with 100 million people ? It would take all the help of all of our allies and , probably most of our enemies too , but this is our best option . I ? s impossible . Even if we could evacuate , what about everything in the impact zone ? Cities , farms , factories . It would be economic suicide . America would be blasted back to the Stone Age . Allowing the comet to hit could create a cloud of dust and ... sulphur aerosols that would block out the rays of the sun . Food production then becomes impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more through starvation . It could be an Ice Age all over again . Brendan Kelly , Queen's University . I 'd like to add something . An impact winter is not a certainty . It depends on how much sulphurthere is in the comet , how much sulphurthere is in the impact zone . The come ? s precise mass and speed , the truth , the truth is ... we won't know ... until i ? s too late . Thank you , and if we don't know then how can we commit to such an extreme course of action ... Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen ... ... tha ? ll be all for now . - Frank ... - Sir ? ... could you stay back a moment ? - Absolutely . You knew that he would go forthe nuclear deflection ... because he gets to use all his little toys ... and he gets to play the big military hero and that is why you suggested it . - But if it works , it works . - What if it doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disagree . Not at this stage we're not , and not after I 'd laid out very clearly what that strategy would be . ... listen up . General Harris hasjust green lit the nuclear option . But , but , but he's also considering other plans . The final decision will hinge on the outcome of the probe , is that understood ? Yes sir . In the meantime , since you two are unable to agree on a single thing , I suggest you stay out of each other's way ... and find out exactly where GBA is gon na hit ... to the nearest millimetre . Adam Gregorski , sir . Post New Orleans , several people whose opinions I'm supposed to respect have told me ... you're the best man FEMA has . What I'm about to say to you is highly classified . I'm a professional . General , I assume tha ? s why you called me in . I need FEMAto work up an emergency mass evacuation strategy . It needs to exceed the remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DCPAwas tasked with ... creating a Crisis Relocation Plan ... Designed to evacuate citizens from urban centres in the event of a nuclear attack . ... Right , and if we continue to fund the programm update it with regular drills the catastrophes we faced during ... hurricanes Rita and Katrina could have been mitigated . The sad fact is we didn't and the crisis we're facing now , makes Katrina look like a walk in the park . You want me to resurrect CRP ? I need you to look at the research it was based on and ... adapt it for something different and far greater in scope . Tha ? s our starting point . Urban or rural evacuations ? Both . Multiple locations . Cities , towns , it could be north , south , east or west , it might be a concentrated geographic area , it could well be scattered over many states . Gregorski , I want you to put together a plan to move 100 million people . Rumours from Los Alamos , New Mexico suggest that ... recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston leaks suggest that ... engineers are secretary adapting rockets to deliver warheads to deflect Gibden-Bell A . Injust two days , Voyager Seven will start beaming back information ... on the precise trajectory of the comet chain , informations NASA scientists insist will be ... critical to the success of any future mission . There's a story that Eisenhower instructed that ... for every five miles of highway they built , it was mandatory that at least one mile be absolutely straight . Well , tha ? s a myth , but I did some digging around ... and what is true is that Congress considered using a flight strip programme in their Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 , and that got me thinking . Besides utilising all the military and commercial air bases on the West Coast , why should we not also use ourfreeways and ... use them as improvised landing strips ? Now this here is a map of the Utah desert . Interstate 80 ... mile after mile of straight road . Can you work this up state by state ? We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible ... and they will require several levels of adaptation , bulldozing the central reservations , removing power lines and signs . Reinforcing the ground to take the weight of small aircraft , but if we have to move people fast we can move them , and en masse . Our roads become our runways . Tha ? s the idea . Injust 12 hours , Voyager Seven will start its analysis of comet Gibden-Bell . Reports of military activity on several continents appears to confirm that ... a nuclear deflection strategy is moving into an advanced stage . Evacuation capacity index . Our 37 largest urban areas . How is the index calculated ? Traffic flow , highway capacity , accessibility to cars . The report also shows information on the transit dependent . How bad is that ? Those 20 cities will be harderto evacuate than ... New Orleans was after Katrina . Are you saying i ? s impossible ? Nothing's impossible . We'll have international help , offers are flooding in . Le ? s get it ready . The world holds its collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat that mankind has faced is revealed forthe very first time . These simple somewhat hypnotic pictures live from the probe Voyager Seven show ... the comet chain in all its terrible beauty . Only now will we learn the true nature of the threat that we all face . Entire nations have come to a standstill . Factories , offices , schools , all closed ... as people gaze in awe at the simple images that we see here . The comet chain , Gibden-Bell as it hurtles towards the earth . Pasadena ... lost transmission . Please confirm . Land impact confirmed , civil unrest breaks out . Curfew imposed from dusk til dawn , ... as America wakes up to the news . Unless scientists can stop it , comet Gibden-Bell will hit North America . The probe was destroyed before it had a chance to feed back any data , the official announcement will be made tomorrow , but I wanted you all to hear it first hand . The decision has been made to go ahead with the nuclear deflection strategy ... scheduled for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't sell your solution to the President , and he can't sell it to the American people . My responsibility is to protect the United States of America . And who's gon na protect the rest of the world when the comet splits up into a thousand pieces ? If it breaks up , and ain't we all part of the same planet ? What is wrong with you people ? It is so clearly betterto go into the terrible situation with a known risk than ... to take an alternative with an ambiguous outcome ... where the hazards are much worse for Americans and the whole world and General with all due respect if you weren't so worried about your career ... - then you could sell this to the President ... - Neil . Get him outta here . ... you could sell it to the President . - Someone get him outta here . - You could sell it to the President ... - Get him outta here ... Forget it Brendan , just forget it . This report here pertains to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... here , for instance here sir , we have an example of plans to dismantle relocate the Statue of Liberty . My recommendation is that we allocate the bulk of our resources into saving our people . Of course . Well we've also made provisions for animal preservation and transportation , cattle , sheep and swine movements will have to be assessed , that is here sir ... The President has given his go-ahead for the nuclear option . I understand . But if that should fail , God hope it doesn't , then this plan will be invaluable . This is good work . Professor Gant , isn't it ? We met in Ireland briefly at Shannon Airport , your , yourfellow compatriot ? Yeah right . What are you doing in the road there's a curfew on , they'll pick you up . Get in . This is brilliant . Thank you , thanks . It could really do this huh ? They could really pull this off . Are you sure the deflection plan will backfire ? No . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater probability that it won't , based on all the information that we have and ... especially everything that we don't have . I am 100 percent convinced that the deflection strategy is the wrong way to go . The outcome of this is still in your hands Neil . You'vejust got ta persuade General Harris to go against every military bone in his body . Oh is that all ? Yes tha ? s all . Listen , you'vejust got ta come up with something , you've got ta give him something , I don't know what , some intel , pictures , reports , just somethin Arecibo . Wha ? s that ? Oh Neil , I'm such an idiot . Arecibo i ? s an observatory in Puerto Rico , Josh was trying to get images up before , there's still a chance they might have some radar images , can you drive me somewhere please ? World leaders meet to discuss the impending comet threat . The President is expected to make an official statement at six pm tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option . Around the world people of all faiths gather in prayer and ... contemplation as the earth awaits its destiny . Oh the return of the native ! Where have you been , we've been worried . Have you seen Josh ? Yeah he's playing pool , i ? s not a pretty sight . We're gon na convince General Harris to change his mind . Well this might come in handy , sulphur results from Rockall , the levels are practically zero . If the comet hits us there's no chance for nuclear winter , the earth would survive . Fantastic Brendan , we've got something pretty great here too . Hey ... I wan na apologise to you , to all of you , my behaviour was totally unacceptable , I'm sorry I never intended to make anybody look bad . You made us all look bad . - Did you see Brendan's report ? - I did . - What do you think ? - I ? s not enough on its own . Oh Josh please , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to absorb the kind of energy tha ? s gon na be required to make a deflection work . I think you know that Josh ... because if we fire those missiles up there i ? sjust gon na explode ... and the fall out ... the fall outs gon na kill all of us . Do you remember Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy who fixed us up in Ireland ? General Harris asked for him to develop an evacuation strategy . The Joint Chiefs were seriously considering it actually . I've seen the plan , Adam thinks that he can pull it off , I do too . So ... if we let the comet hit yeah i ? s gon na be a major catastrophe , but we can manage it , we can plan for it , we can save lives . If it breaks up ... I ? s not going to break up . Think about what we saw in Ireland . The people , the places . That was one Tsunami . We risk creating multiples with this strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I've got everything I need right here but unfortunately I can't do it without you , so ... the Arecibo Conservatory came through , you were right about having a back-up . Look at it man , look at it , i ? s smooth which suggeststhat i ? s fragile . Yes , well smooth does imply i ? s more likely to break apart . Right . - But hardly definitive . - Oh come on Josh ! I ? s Occam's razor , Josh . All things being equal , the simplest solution is the right one , and there's nothing much more simple than this . We can't fight nature . We've got ta live with it . General , this report is based on the latest intelligence we have . It clearly backs up our worst case scenarios for the nuclear deflection plan . Our worse case scenarios ? You convinced me to go with that plan , you championed it , you're its chief architect . This is true but there's new evidence now . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be allowed to land unimpeded . Why have you changed your mind ? This latest intelligence report and ... the input and ... intuition of one of the finest scientific minds in the world . General , NASA is now 100 percent behind the evacuation option . The radar images from the Arecibo observatory have now been ... backed up by new images from the Goldstone solar system radar in California . Now , we believe that togetherthey present sufficient evidence to suggest that ... nuclear deflection runs too great a risk of fracturing the comet . You 'd see America exposed ? Our infrastructure decimated ? Our way of life immeasurably altered ? The alternative is a world in a kind of chaos that it will not survive . America will survive sir , I believe that . These men are my specialists . General , I trust them absolutely . Sir , is it true you were awarded the Medal of Honour in Vietnam ? Yes . Have you heard the story of one of yourfellow Medal winners , Marine Private Jack Lee Lucas ? The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 . Private Lucas was with three other men crawling through a ravine ... when the Japanese launched a hand grenade attack . He threw himself on two of the grenades to save his companions , the blast blew him into the air , ripped chunks out of his chest , but he survived . Lucas didn't ask to be a hero , he took the shrapnel from those grenades because ... it was the only thing to do . America needs to step up and take that hit because ... because it can . Tha ? s a very nice story Professor , but like you . I preferto make my decisions based on the evidence before me . Gentlemen . Leave me to think this through . Tonight the North East of America is on the move . Instead of the widely expected strategy of nuclear deflection , the President unveiled a comprehensive Federal Evacuation Plan , now 15 US and two Canadian States are being relocated . The authorities have_just four weeks to safely evacuate 100 million people . Tonight the mass exodus of Washington starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities all across the Eastern States , as people living east of the line of separation flee their homes in their millions . International support has been described as "" overwhelming "" . Ships , aircraft and essential supplies are being ... directed to the evacuation zone from around the world . Navies from Russia , India , Great Britain and France are ... assisting with the evacuation of the eastern sea port . The plan has been hailed as comprehensive in its application , ... encompassing all aspects of historical and contemporary existence . On Liberty Island the rescue programme is underway for New York's most famous cultural landmark . Where should we draw the line ? From muzeums to zoos , tha ? s the question facing officials as the hours tick by . Sir , they're suggesting that we re-commission the bunkerfacility ... in the Greenbriar Hotel in West Virginia . Forget about Greenbriar , strike it off the list . Even though they survive the impact ... they'll be crawling into a burning desert , i ? s no good . Elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save ? Er ... you know , aside from human beings , the elephant is the only other land animal that actually sheds tears . Tha ? s very touching Leon but i ? s not true . Many animals produce tears to lubricate the eye , it does not imply emotion . But apart from us the elephants are the only one's that seem to grieve ... when they lose a family member , when an elephant walks past the spot where they lost a loved one ... theyjust stop still . They mourn their dead . Across the impact zone ... airports , military and private airfields are working around the clock to maximise the evacuation . In the rest of the world flights have ground ... to a halt as national airlines donate theirfle Military aircraft and cargo carriers are being adapted to ferry evacuees at unprecedented rates . More planes are being put in the air in one hour than are normally undertaken in an entire day . I've been told that even crop sprayers are being utilised to help airlift people out ... of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large international airports such Dulles that ... the true scale of the evacuation can be seen . Freeways , highways , just about anywhere an aircraft can land has been requisitioned by FEMAto accelerate the exodus . Skies above major Southern State cities are filled with planes . Volunteer air crews , emergency and military personnel will be those at the front line , risking themselves to the very end to ensure that as many people as possible get out alive . - Josh ! Any sign of Marcie's transport ? - Not yet . I don't want you to do this , I want you to be so efficient , just get on that flight and never look back . Nobody forced me , I volunteered remember ? Well don't take too many trips and , I mean don't leave it too long to get yourflight out of there okay ? I ? s here ! This is it . I ? s ... not for Marcie , i ? s for us . Sorry . Marcie , I ... I know . You've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Be safe . I will . Five days before comet impact and civil unrest spreads throughout the impact zone . Despite the massive numbers successfully transported to safety , panic is spreading amongst those for whom time is running out . Josh ! Josh we got it , we've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania , i ? s Pennsylvania . - You sure ? - Yeah , i ? s Pennsylvania . Okay . Yeah , can I speak to General Harris please ? Urgently . Hi , i ? s Josh Hayden here , we've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania . The State of Pennsylvania has been identified , ... as the likely epicentre of the comet impact . Prioritised now for evacuation resources are being swiftly ... directed towards the State and the surrounding areas . Exact impact possibilities now ... include the Pennsylvanian cities of Harrisburgh , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Johnstown , or Altoona . I wan na thank you for all the hard work your people put in . We're not gon na have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five percent of the population of the Eastern States being left behind . We can only do wha ? s in our powerto do , and you've done what you can Adam . Well not yet , I'm co-ordinating the final stages for Virginia from Dulles airport . Good luck . When do you leave sir ? I'll be turning out the lights . Last man standing sir ? The Federal Authorities today claimed a 90 percent rate of successful evacuation of the impact States Cities across North East America stand empty afterthe mass re-location of some 90 million people . With less than 48 hours to go those remaining in the impact zone are urged to ... make their way to the congregation points at ports and airfields to ensure their safe evacuation . We have 15 minutes to turn this aircraft around . Quickly as you can please . Fill in from the back ... and sit down as soon as you're inside . Wait , don't close the door . Don't close that . I , I was with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he's gone . Well if he's not on this flight sir he'll be ... I have to find him , I'm getting off . Look this is your last ticket out of here , you miss this you won't get out alive , now get back to your seat ... now ... sir . Ladies and gentlemen , for everybody left standing , there are straps and rails provided , please hold on to them with both hands very tightly . I can get three more planes back in the sky in an hour , but we've lost half ourfuelling crew , I need more men . You carry on loading , I'll worry about the crew , you're doing a goodjob , keep it going . Sir ... you may need this . I ? s starting to spiral . Guys ... i ? s Pittsburgh . So Pittsburgh will take the full force of Gibden-Bell A . In the first few seconds after impact a ... 25 mile wide fireball will vaporise everything in its path . The shock wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered buildings and bones in its wake . As far as Chicago , Washington , Toronto and New York , the shock wave will hit these cities at 600 miles per hour and ... will be followed by a force nine earthquake . God help anyone left behind . I wan na thank you for your bravery and patience . Now we're looking at the last few calls , sections one and two will leave on the first transport , likewise Frank there's nothing more for your people to do here , you're all on the next chopper . If you say so sir . Le ? s go team . I 'd like to stay please . This is the best place to keep tabs on things and ... I just wan na make sure that my calculations are absolutely correct . A little late in the day for_that . Yeah I know but ... can we please stay ? Very well . You'll be on the last transport with me . I 'd like to stay as well . We're witnessing history in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rivertwice . Guess I'm in too . And me . No , not you . I won't have it . Is that fair ? I wan na stay . When was anything everfair ? If things go wrong here we're gon na need scientists on the West Coast and ... you're so much smarterthan us . Hey . One day to impact and with time running out , special rescue teams are targeting those unable to get to designated assembly points . All able-bodied people are urged to get to an evacuation centre as soon as possible . We're in the final stages of the evacuation here at Dulles , and the last flights are now leaving . With three hours left to go before impact , ... it is finally time to say goodbye to our Nation's Capital . I ? s weird but I feel ... kinda relieved now , you know . You're relieved ? Finally you're relieved ! Morning death , we've been expecting you . What is that ? Is that , is that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Is that yours ? Yeah ! Do you like it ? You know what , e-mail it to someone just in case ... we don't make it outta here . Jeez you noisy monkeys , what time is it ? This is it then eh ? The helicopter's on its way , time to go gentlemen , that includes you son . 26,000 men and women worked within these walls , tomorrow there'll be nothing but dust . we_just lost the chopper . Lost contact ? Sir , it , it_just disappeared , I have no idea what happened . Have you tried to raise Bravo Six ? They're out of range . We're trapped here aren't we ? Adam Gregorski's at Dulles airport , civilian evac . Change of plan , we're going by road . Authorities have advised that there will be no more flights leaving forthe impact zone . Flights out will continue for_just one more hour . Marcie , hey , hey where are you ? We'rejust coming into Dulles airport now , but where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Well how far are you ? We're close , how long can you hold it for ? Marcie ? Marcie ? Marcie ? You need to re-direct those people at Dulles , and it has to be done in stages , do you understand ? - We're swamped here already . - Yes , sir . But i can't . You get them on the transports , have the men escort them in groups of 300 , stagger it every half hour , you can do this Leon . Please be advised that we are re-directing all inbound planes , there will be no further landings . Prepare final craft fortake off . Quickly as possible folks , if you couldjust ... move on , move along , quickly as possible . Fill the seats up as soon as you're inside , forthose of you left standing , there are rails and straps fitted , please hold on as tightly as possible . Dead end . Alright Sergeant , ten more , go ! Come on , straight up , straight up . Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way ... - Don't shoot ... - We're getting on , let me through . - Don't shoot , don't shoot . - We're getting on . - Sir , you've got your daughter with you ... Get back ! Do not do this with your daughter ... - Stand back ! - Do not do this sir , now I need you to help me sir , I promise you , you'll make it out ... I said get back ! I know you're scared , we're all scared ... but if we work together we can make this through . Now I promise you , you and your daughter will be on a plane out of here ... but you've got ta help me . Please ... give me the gun . At least save my daughter ! - Close up the plane . - Yes sir . I need ... two more minutes please . I'm sorry Marcie , we can't wait any longer . Preparing to taxi , hold tight ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s still here . Everybody's going . We're too late . Get out of the way ! I've got ta find Marcie . Stay where you are , don't move ! Don't move . Hold your weapon soldier , there's a FEMA officer in charge here , take us to him . Come on , le ? s go , come on . - Yes sir . - Le ? s go . Marcie , Marcie ? Hey , hey , where are you ? We're on the runway , where are you ? We're on the plane at the far side of the runway . She's on that one , le ? s go . Get him outta here , Get him outta here . Hold the crowd back , hold them back . Are you alright mate ? Come on ... What you doing ? I've got ta go back , I've got ta go back , I've got ta go back , get on the plane ... - Marcie we're here , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you in . Rear door unsecured , what the hell's going on back there ? We've to leave right now . Come on , don't restrain me , get on the plane . Go ... Hold ' em back ... come on hold ' em back . Gim me that gun . Josh , come on ! Secure the rear door . We gon na leave right now . When the impact was exhausted the North American landscape would be changed forever . A scorched , broken wasteland . No-one yet knows how many died . Five million , maybe more ... but in this moment we have survived . In this moment we have come through the worst . The world will keep on turning ... and mankind will find a way . This time .

And Mrs Conyngham-Jervis owned the house , currently valued at ? 700,000 . That's a million and a half . You sure ? Quite sure , Squadron Leader . Now , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! "" I desire that my husband , if I should pre-decease him , "" be permitted to live in our home , The Cedars , Neville Park , "" but that after his death , it be sold , "" the proceeds going to the British Association for Adoption and Fostering , "" to aid those who are childless . "" I bequeath to my husband , Reginald Vivian Conyngham-Jervis , "" ? 10,000 a year . "" The remainder of my property I leave to my nieces , Celia and Felicity , "" to be divided between them in equal shares and held in trust until they marry "" or they have attained the age of 30 , whichever is the sooner . "" Roughly speaking , that means 400,000 for each of you , after payment of estate duty . Your wife asked me to hand you this letter if she died before you . Thank you . Fine . ' Darling Reggie . ' I hope all this didn't come as too much of a shock . ' I hope you won't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see what I mean . ' As for Felicity and Celia , they're dear girls ' and they had a rough time when their father remarried . ' I don't think Susan really cares for them much . ' I wanted them to have independence . So don't be too cross , Reggie . ' I think I've left enough for you not to have to pull your horns in too much . ' But after what happened ... ' No ! ' I know I haven't been a very exciting wife . ' But I have loved you . ' I wish I 'd been able to say it more often . ' Marriage is a funny thing , isn't it ? It isn't easy . ' Lt's not what you expect it's going to be . ' We've had a rather English marriage , I think . ' Mr Southgate and Squadron Leader Conyngham-Jervis . Now , I've had a rather wild idea . I'll show you what will be your quarters . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big room , just for one . Is it ? Oh , I suppose some people might think so . Er , wardrobe , chest , usual gubbins , your own bathroom next door . When you think of the places we slept in during the war . Absolutely . - Who were you with ? - Pioneer Corps . Went over on D-Day , right through to the end . Jolly useful job you chaps did too . Great days . Best years of your life bar none . Always wondered who they were , these blokes who really enjoyed their war . Oh , well , now you've met one . Yeah . Jolly good . Right , er ... shall we go downstairs and have a bit of a confab ? Sure you won't ? Bit early for me , thanks . Very wise , I'm sure . Now , er , look here , Southgate , this notion the little popsy from the social services dreamt up looked a bit strange at first blush , but there might be something in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could do with help on the domestic side , cooking and that , and we could both do with a bit of company . What I was thinking of was more the practical arrangements . I've been eating at the local , mostly , Feathers . Getting a bit sick of it . I'm not much of a cook . I left all that to Mary . I gather from that popsy you're rather a whizz in that department . There's not much I can't do . I'm more inclined to traditional stuff , roasts and three veg , steak and kidney pie , steamed puds . And I suppose , on your side , what you get is the free accommodation . - I've got a house of me own . - Yes , yes . But er ... heating , etcetera , your own rooms , run of the house , garden . Er , you drive ? - Anything and everything . - Including milk floats , I gather . Well , you could use the old motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have the use of the car yourself when I don't need it . Really ? Thanks . Very kind of you . What do you say ? Give it a whirl , shall we ? All right . Yeah . Oh , yeah , there is one thing . What do we call each other ? Good point . I suppose I call you Southgate , you call me Squadron Leader . How 'd that be ? Are you sure you wouldn't prefer sir ? Well ... it's a bit formal , don't you think ? Move your stuff round at the weekend and I'll run you round in the Elvis . Can't say fairer than that , what ? OK . You're on . Jolly good . He's a weird old stick . If you don't like it , we don't have to stay . We'll be popping back weekends , make sure everything's all right at home . # Pennsylvania six-five-thousand ! - Need any help ? - Er , if you could lay the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Excellent , Southgate . Mmm . - Well done . - Not bad , was it ? Not bad at all . Now , er , look here . Er , I thought I might go down to the pub for a couple or three . I don't suppose you 'd care to er ... No , you're not much of a drinking man . Oh , well . Jolly good . Jolly good start . I might be rather late back , so you go up when you're ready . Don't wait up . Got me key , right ? Er , and I'm to clear the supper things and wash up , am I ? Well , all in your own good time . No urgency . Er ... damn fine dinner that , Southgate . Appreciate it very much . Cheerio ! Let's face it , in a dogfight , the tighter you turn , the more chance you've got . My God , the Spitfire had one hell of a tight turn . Just flipped over like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that's it , isn't it ? - What ? - Know-how . Yes , damn right . Another one in there . You see , the way I see it , Squadron Leader , you take your life in your hands every time you step on a plane . That's not so , Jimbo , not if you know what you're doing . Take the Messerschmitt , for instance . - Fine aircraft ... - What a day ! Stocktaking , what a nightmare . Scotch and sympathy required . Allow me . A Glenmorangie for the lady . Make it a large one . Well , I don't know you , but the way I feel , that 'd be a lifesaver . That 'd be lovely , thanks . - Smoke ? - Oh , dear , I don't know . Well , yeah , go on . Lead me astray . Oh , I'm Elizabeth Franks , by the way . Everyone calls me Liz . I'm er ... Reginald Conyngham-Jervis . Everyone calls me Reggie . Cheers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - No . No . Lucky man . I shouldn't say that - mine are darlings . - But one never stops worrying . - Prep school , are they ? That's very gallant of you , Reggie . They're a bit older . Hugo's doing that round-the-world thing . - And Alicia did a bit of modelling . - Takes after her mother , then . Thank you , kind sir . And now she's trying out catering . One just wishes they 'd settle down and get on with their lives . Absolutely . For me , it was straight out of the RAF into the family firm . Still active there . The chairman's my nephew , Lord Blyth-Gowry . I still think of him as young Vivian . Could still do with a steadying hand . Yes , and I bet you're just the man . Might I ask what the family firm is ? Conyngham-Jervis , London , Hong Kong , big trading company . - I believe we started in opium . - Ooh ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . And you ? Oh , very small beer compared to that . I've a boutique in the Pantiles . Designer labels for the discerning woman . And though I say it as shouldn't , I do think I'm a bit special . I'll drink to that . You're so sweet . I don't believe you're real . I'm real enough . Large as life , twice as ugly . I wouldn't say that either . Tell me , Southgate . What do you do for women ? Nothing now . Hell of a problem , right ? Not for me . I never really wanted anyone but Grace . That so ? Right from the off . We was both a bit shy to begin with . Took us a while to get the hang of it . - After that ... - I know what you mean . Nothing to beat it , eh ? Every night of our married life . - Really ? - More than that when we was younger . You're right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more her I miss . I can't imagine doing it with anyone else . I expect you feel the same . Not really , no . Oh , there's more in you than meets the eye , Sonny Jim ! By the way , don't forget , I've got the car tomorrow . - I'm gon na see me son . - Yep , fine . - Are you sure ? - I said so , didn't I ? So , erm , you're a beggar and no mistake . I 'd heard of chaps who stuck to one woman all their lives but never met one . Strange world . I mean , I've had more women than I can remember , you've had just the one . But if what you say is true , then you must have had a heck of a lot more jumps than I have . - So who's the winner , eh ? - Didn't think it was a competition . You are a prissy little tight-arsed bastard , aren't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Hello ? - Is that still the number for Sabrina ? ' I'll just see if she's free , sir . - ' Who should I say it is ? ' - Er ... Tell her it's the Squadron Leader . Reggie . It's been a while , but she'll remember . I'm sure she will , sir . - I remember you very well . - Ah . Lovely to hear from you again . Just hold on a second , Squadron Leader . Squadron Leader Reggie . Oh , yes . Hang on . - Just hold on , sir . Thank you . - Mm , mm . Yes . Here he is . Posh old geezer . Straight sex . Got it up last time and he calls it the Big Bad Boy . Sweeeeet . Here she is , sir . Reggie , darling ! I thought you 'd forgotten all about me . So how's that Big Bad Boy of yours ? A bit out of practice , since you mention it . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - So ... when can you come ? - Wednesday . Day after tomorrow ? - Wednesday ? - Mm-mm . Er ... I've got a cancellation tomorrow , at three . Er , right . I'll see you then . Ah , Southgate . Look here , about tomorrow . - Yeah . I've got to leave early . - Well , that's just it . All off . Operation scrubbed . Need the car meself . Going to London . You can't do that , Squadron Leader . You promised . I've made the arrangements . You'll just have to unmake them . I need the car , you see . - Tell him you'll make it the week after . - No , that's no good . Alan's expecting me . I can't let him down . - I've got to have that car . - There's no "" got to "" about it . It's my car . I said you could have it when I didn't need it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuits ? You promised me , I asked you if it was definite and you said yeah . Now you're trying to go back on it . Where I come from , a gentleman is somebody who keeps his word . You think I'm just an unpaid servant . You think you can treat me any way you like . Either I have that car tomorrow or that's it , I'm packing me bags . Make your mind up . Oomph . God , man , keep your hair on . You can have the ruddy car if it means so much to you . I'll go up by train . Suit me better , as a matter of fact . London's a bit of a nightmare these days . Good . Well , that's settled , then . Who's won the pools , then ? So you get to drive his Elvis , and what does he get ? Well , he's like a lot of these Neville Park types . He's got no idea how to look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . It works out . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . What's wrong with that ? And he gives the orders and you take ' em ? Mum's dead and you don't feel right unless someone's bossing you about . It isn't like that at all , Alan . So what's he like in bed , then ? - ' Yes ? ' - Squadron Leader . ' Up you come . ' Oh , Reggie , darling ! What a man ! - There you are , sir . - Thank you . Here you are . That's all right . Thank you . Southgate ! Southgate , are you home ? All present and correct . Supper's sausages and mash . Cup of tea ? Bugger tea . Let's have a pink gin . Get that apron off . Jolly good , jolly good . Good day out ? Not bad . Car went like a bird . Thanks for letting me have it . Any time , old chap , any time . Just say the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man being as old as he feels ? Yeah ? Well , I'm here to tell you - they are bloody well right ! Here . - Glad to hear it . - Cheers . - Cheers . I've had such a lovely time , Reggie . How about a nightcap , back at my place ? You haven't seen it . It's just round the corner . That's sweet of you , but I've got my car here . - You're very sweet too , Liz . - Bless you . - You know I 'd love to ... - It means a lot to me . Meeting you has been the best thing to happen to me since God knows when . Say yes . Say you'll say yes . All right . But only on condition that we go there in my car . Absolutely . Jolly good idea . Chocks away ! Chocks away , Squadron Leader ! Lovely house . Yes . Over the porch it says 1899 . So what do you say ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really should be going . It's long past midnight . You're a lovely girl . - Oh , Reggie . - Liz . You're so exciting . Oh ... Reggie ... Don't , I ... I never meant ... I want to make love to you more than anything in the world . Oh , Reggie , I don't know . It's much too soon . We hardly know each other . I think we do , you know . Oh , dear . Kiss me again . - What was that ? - Oh , no one . What do you mean ? It can't be no one . - You told me you lived alone . - I do . It's Southgate . - Who's Southgate ? - Just a man . Just a servant . My m-manservant . Manservant ? Don't worry . Come on , darling . Let's go upstairs . No , it doesn't feel right , not with someone else here . - Come on ! - No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - You can't leave me like this . - No , let me go ! It is late and I've got an early start tomorrow . It's been a lovely evening , Reggie . Thank you . You'll phone me soon , won't you ? Promise . Southgate ! I suppose you realise you've ruined my whole fucking evening . Home and dry , and you've got to cock it up with your weak bladder ! You're about as much bloody use as a fart in a bottle ! Good night ! No , I realise it wasn't your fault . Bloody woman just panicked . Strange creatures , women . Like bloody antelopes . One wrong sound and they panic . - Want another ? - I don't mind if I do . You're getting the hang of whisky drinking . It's your birthday . I never thought I 'd be spending it like this . Still . Good dinner , good whisky ... Who needs women ? Ever been to Scotland , Southgate ? Matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . When I was a boy , we 'd spend a month up there every year . - Just like royalty . - Just like royalty . They go to Balmoral , we went to Roxburghshire . - Blairgowrie Castle . - You had a castle ? Course we had a castle . Not any more . Bloody Vivian , Lord Blyth-Gowry , "" can't justify the expense "" . Bloody toerag . Ahh ... We had the best of times , Southgate . Just once a year , we had this bloody great party . Everyone was equal , all pissed as rats , all the family , guests , keepers , kitchen maids - and there were one or two of them , I tell you ! Mmm . And now I've got to make do with you . And vice versa . Mm . So ... we keep our peckers up . We're not dismayed . I know what we need . A bit of music . Let's see what we've got over here , shall we ? Heh ! Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mmm . I think you'll remember this one , Southgate . # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself # Alone ... # Ah ! Excellent . Southgate , on your feet . What for ? Don't argue the toss with me . Come on , get up . Come on , turn round , now . Put your arms there . No , no . There . # Leave all your lovers # Weepin ' on a faraway shore # Out on the briny # With the moon big and shiny # Melting your heart of stone # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself , alone # Thank you , Southgate . God bless you , sir . Happy birthday . Italy ? Why didn't you say before ? - Who are you going with ? - Just friends , Reggie . I'm not giving you the run-around . It's partly a buying trip for the shop . I'll give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll see you when I see you , then . - What is it ? - Just checking it's OK to have the car . - I said so , didn't I ? - Well , have you got the keys ? Oh . Oh . Erm ... - Take it . There you are . - Thank you . No ! Got a letter from June to say she's found another bloke . And , "" I hope one day I'll be able to forgive you for what you did to me . "" Silly cow . It was nothing to do with her , nothing . And she never really cared . It was never a proper marriage , just going through the motions . So to speak . She was terribly upset , Alan . We all were . She thought I had a girl on the side . Got the shock of her life when she found out . Well , you could say we all did . - Broke your mother's heart . - Bollocks . It was just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for her . Vera went to Australia to escape . I'm not listening . You never did listen . Always took her side . You don't get it . You made me like this . You wan na know why ? Because you and her made me feel like nothing . You disgust me . I know . I always did . Squadron Leader , I'm home ! On the terrace . Hot enough for you ? Time flies , eh ? Sorry I'm a bit late . I'll get the supper on . Oh , bugger that . I don't want your long-suffering act . Come on , man . Sit down , have a drink , enjoy life . Dinner can wait a bit . All right , I'll have a small one . Oh , he'll have a small one . Splendid . We 'd drop dead of astonishment if you asked for a large one . Cheers . What sort of day did you have ? I wouldn't say pleasant . He's in jug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say that ? - Just guessed . - Come on , am I right ? - Yeah , you're right . It's all right , man . Not your fault . Can't be responsible for him all of your life . What did he do ? No need to say if you don't want to . - I 'd rather not , if you don't mind . - Fair enough . These things happen in the best of families , you know . Nothing to be done about it . Just get on with it . That's it . I can't see where we went wrong with him . All we wanted was for him to be happy . Of course you did . It's just one of those things . It's a damn shame . But you're not to blame . Bad show , end of story . It isn't as if we didn't set him a good example , his mum and me . We was always happily married . We had a wonderful marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . Hmph . I don't think anybody ever said that about me and Mary . I don't think I 'd have liked it if they had . We rubbed along all right . I had a few flings . Nothing serious . She always forgave me . If she found out , that is . Never talked much . Didn't see the need for it . - Miss her , though . - Yeah . Yeah . But , you know , it does get a bit easier , as time passes . Never thought it would , but it does . She was very fond of dogs . We used to have two of them . Labs . They were called Huntley and Palmer . Dead now , of course . Years ago . Hmph ! She loved those dogs . Hm . Brrr ! Getting a bit chilly . - Bit of supper ? - Oh ... Dinner , Southgate , dinner . Absolutely useless . Talk to your bloody self . Come on ! Chic To Chic . Buongiorno . Could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie , darling ! - Why didn't you tell me you were back ? - I was just about to when you phoned . - I had a million things to do . - More important than me ? Oh , darling , please don't be like that . Who was that chap ? In your shop . Er ... I happened to be passing . Tuesday . He was kissing you . Oh ! Darling , that was Colin . He's got the art gallery across the way . He's a mate . And he's gay . - He's a poofter ? - Yes . Oh . Then there isn't anyone else ? No , there isn't anybody else . If there were someone else , if you were giving me the run-around , I don't think I could bear that . Yes , I know . It's all right , Reggie , but you have to understand that I am a woman . I had grasped that . And I need to be quite sure of my feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Good Lord , no . Not for the world . This chap's looking a bit peaky . Waiter ! What you said , I quite understand . Absolutely . But er ... on the other hand , I'm a man . Can't hold out for ever . Yes ! - ' Can I speak to Mr S ... ' - What ? - ' Mr Southgate . ' - Southgate ? What the hell are you bothering me for ? Oh , all right , don't tell me . Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone ! Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone for you . Take it downstairs and tell them not to phone you here again . Speaking . Yeah . Er ... Er ... Yeah , yeah , I-I-I'll do that . Yeah , right away . Yeah . Er ... thanks for letting me know . Who the hell was that ? Bloody outrageous . Er , it was the prison . My son's dead . Is it all right if I take the car ? Good God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course you can take the car , old chap . A bloody awful thing . I'll just er ... I'll just get out of your way . We are extremely sorry about this , Mr Southgate . It wasn't simply a cry for help . He clearly wanted to end his own life . There's always the possibility in these circumstances as the release date looms . But your son had no anxiety that we could detect about going back into society . And he had people who cared about him . Not many fathers would have stood by their sons as you have , Mr Southgate . - I want him to have a proper funeral . - Of course . And could I just say again how sorry we are , Mr Southgate ? Yeah , I know . It wasn't your fault . He's at peace now , Grace . That's the way we've got to look at it . We did our best for him . 32 separate offences . And all with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 14-year-old boy . He 'd never admit there was anything wrong in it . Of course , they put a restraining order on him . He said , "" If I can't see Gerry again , "" I don't want to live . "" What makes somebody go wrong like that ? Was it my fault ? I was always hard on him , you know . Strict . Maybe we both expected too much of him . Absolute bloody rubbish . People make their own bloody messes . It's not as if you beat him black and blue . All you can do is tell them what's right as you see it . The rest is up to them . You loved that boy of yours . Any fool can see that . Not your fault . Nothing to reproach yourself with . Nothing at all . No ! Are you suggesting I should sell up to become a shop assistant ? Wouldn't be that different from what you're doing now . And you'll be taking home regular money every week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to swallow our pride sometimes . - How old are you , Mr Whittington ? - 32 . I can't help it . I have to work to strict guidelines . The bank will extend your business loan for another 30 days . After that , either we see reducing payments , or we'll call in the loan . I'll confirm this in writing . Yes , what ? Reggie , darling , it's Liz . Liz ! How are you ? Long time no see . Whose fault was that ? I've been waiting by the phone . Well , I thought I 'd give you a bit of space . Isn't that what they say nowadays ? - Anyway , what are you doing Friday ? - Nothing . Or if I was , I've just cancelled it . How about dinner here ? Nothing elaborate - my man can look after us . There's nothing I 'd like better . Very good . Er ... about eight ? - How's it going ? - Everything's under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the terrace . I'll bring you a drink . Oh , jolly good . What's that - Pimm's ? Excellent . Pour away . Have one yourself , take the weight off . Calm before the storm , eh ? No , no , not in that glass . Put yours in there , huh ? Mmm . Jolly good Pimm's , that . Cheers . Cheers . Er ... I wanted to say , I know we've had our ups and downs , but I-I'm glad I come here , to help you out . So am I , Southgate . Never regretted it for a moment . Will you be popping the question tonight ? None of your damn business . Well , er ... I rather thought I would , as a matter of fact . How did you know ? Instinct . Got a nose for these things . Now , don't take this wrong , but if it was to go well for you tonight , and Mrs Franks moves in , what with Alan having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Really ? Oh , I never thought of that . I thought you 'd remain here . I've got used to you now . You're part of the furniture . - Part of the woodwork . - I know . I'm not saying it wouldn't be a wrench , but it wouldn't work . She 'd understand . Damn silly . I need you here . I won't leave you stranded . I'll call in , do a spot of cleaning , till you've found someone else . It's not just a matter of going round with a Hoover . I know that . It's not easy for me either . I've been happy here , looking back on it . You took me out of myself and I needed that . You've looked after me and I've looked after you . We've been almost like a couple , in a way . What ? Well , like a kind of a marriage sort of a thing . Have you gone off your rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and check on things in the kitchen . That could be her car . Best of luck . - You look lovely , Liz . - Sweet man . This is Southgate . Southgate , this is Mrs Franks . - Good evening , madam . - Good evening . I'll serve drinks on the terrace , as it's warm , or would you prefer inside ? Will you be chilly in that dress ? Oh , I think the terrace sounds wonderful . What a lovely idea . Thank you , Southgate . Oh , but your garden's glorious ! Should have seen it a few weeks ago . Well ... I think you've got yourself a little paradise here . It can get a bit lonely . Can it ? Care for a Pimm's ? Pimm's ? Oh , Reggie , you are clever . That's absolutely perfect . Squadron Leader ? Madam ? Dinner is served , whenever you're ready . Well , quiet as a mouse , really . She 'd been playing the stock market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stockbroker . Extraordinary . - Successfully , I hope . - Mmm . Ran it up to nearly a million . Never knew she had it in her . She sounds the exact opposite of my ex-husband . He was much better at spending it . I was left with two small children and a pile of debts . - What a bounder . - That's what he was . But still , here I am . Yes , here you are , I'm very glad to say . - Squadron Leader ? - Oh , yes . All done . - Excuse me , madam . - Thanks . That was delicious . Thank you , madam . The desserts and cheese are on the sideboard . Would you like me to serve or ... No , we'll be fine . You can take yourself off for the night . Thank you very much , Squadron Leader . I'll call in in the morning . Good night , madam . Glad you enjoyed your dinner . - Good night , Southgate . - Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , has another cup of tea , some more sandwiches with the chaps there , flies back to Biggin Hill . Weren't you terrified on those missions ? You never had time . You just got on with it . You weren't alone . Good chaps either side . They look after you , you look after them . And afterwards , when you landed , Christ , you felt so alive . Don't you wish you had children to tell about it ? No , they wouldn't understand . How could they ? "" We made England safe for you . "" "" Oh , bugger off , you old fart ! "" No ! We did have a child . What ? We did have a child . A little girl . Lovely . Lovely little thing . Her name was Cecily . We called her Tish or Tishy for some reason . Two years old . Two and a half . Good little walker . Big for her age . Always pulling on her reins . I always remember that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er ... little harness things with long straps . Yes , I remember them . Anyway ... we were out , in the town . Saturday shopping . Just out . Mary wanted to pop in somewhere , haberdasher's , something . Left me ... holding the reins . ' And I don't know , something caught my attention . - ' I looked back ... ' - Tishy ! No ! ' Died instantly . ' My fault , you see . My darling , I'm so sorry . I'm so dreadfully sorry . Poor Reggie . No , not poor Reggie . It was my fault . No good telling me any different . But it was an accident . How could you have known ? I should have looked after her , and I didn't . Cecily Mary . Aged two and a half . Beloved only child . Killed by her father's carelessness .

You won't leave me ? I won't leave you , my darling . And you'll marry me ? Will you marry me ? Of course I'll marry you . Liz , I've ... I've been so awful . But it ... will be different with you . Promise . You're not awful at all . You're a very dear old heffalump . Come on . Er ... I'm not sure the old hydraulics will be in good working order tonight . Don't worry .

Brought you a cup of tea . Another lovely morning . Come on , then . Let's be having you . What are you saying ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on . Bloody hell . I'll call an ambulance . The social worker come round yesterday . We had a bit of a chat about what next . Here he is , my pride and joy . We're doing ever so well , eh , Reggie ? We walked six steps yesterday . See you later . I'll be off , then . Anything you want bringing , next time I come ? Television ? Liz ... Ann ... Liz Franks ? Your lady friend . Ain't she been to see you yet ? No ... Is that a fact ? I'll see what I can do . He asks for you every time I go in , Mrs Franks . To be honest , I'm not awfully good at hospitals . Yes , tell him of course I'll go . Thank you , Southgate . Ah , Southgate , there you are . This is my man , Southgate . - My nephew , Lord Blyth-Gowry . - Pleased to meet you , sir . I gather you found him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner . It's not as if he was in regular touch , is it , sir ? I knew he had a nephew called Lord something . Glenmorangie , I thought , but that's the Scotch , in n it ? We are proud of the Squadron Leader . He's making marvellous progress . Can I have a cigarette , then , please ? I'm afraid not . Fewer cigarettes in the first place and you wouldn't be here . Squadron Leader , I'll pop along to the shop , get your Telegraph . Good man ! Now , look here , I think it might be a few weeks before I get down here again . Good God ! Who erm ... Who is that ? It's my fianc ? e . Excuse me . - Darling , how are you ? - Much better for seeing you . You must be Lord Blyth-Gowry . Liz Franks . How do you do ? Delighted to meet you at last . So sorry it's round his hospital bed . Oh , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to understand that this is an official engagement ? It's very recent . Though we have been together for quite a while . Yes ! Well , I'm sure you 'd like a little time to yourselves . Southgate ! Could I have a word ? What do you know about Liz Franks ? She's a gold-digger . Thinks she's onto a good thing . - Hardly for me to say , sir . - Sooner she knows she isn't , the better . She sees a wealthy old man liable to drop dead any moment . She ought to know that as his widow , she 'd get nothing , not even the house . If she sees herself as the merry widow , and I've no doubt that she does , she ought to be speedily enlightened . Are you going to put her in the picture or am I ? - I'll do it . - Fair enough . Refer her to me if she needs any confirmation . My uncle's going to need long-term residential care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at home . I'm happy to . Really ? Look here , are you sure you're up to it ? I looked after my wife , best part of a year before she died , did everything for her . I 'd want to look after the Squadron Leader . We've got used to each other . And how much would you expect to be paid for your services ? I don't want your money . I've got me pension . We managed before . Thanks very much . - Thank you for telling me . - I'm sorry , madam . Oh , for Christ's sake , do you mind not calling me madam ? - You needn't pretend you're sorry . - I've nothing against you , Mrs Franks . I never thought you was after his money . The bloody awful thing is , though , he was right in a way , that horrible man . - I can't afford to be left with nothing . - That's what I thought . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't just ... Yes . I'll tell him . Darling ! There she is . That's my fianc ? e . My lovely girl . Reggie ... Erm ... Reggie , sweetie ... Is there somewhere private we can go and talk ? Er , day room . Bit of a hole . We can smoke there , though . Southgate smuggles them in . He's a good egg , Southgate . OK ? There we are ! I'm pretty fit . What do you think ? I can do twice round the ward now . They say I can go home in a week . Not bad , eh ? Very good , Reggie . You could come and live with me when I come out . We could get married right away . Or wait , see how I turn out . You don't have to . Don't want to tie you down . You're still young , my darling . Reggie ... I've done wrong . I can't marry you . I should never have agreed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Where are you going ? - I'm going to Italy . And which ... chap ... young chap ... No , it's not a chap . Oh , Reggie , darling , you are very sweet . But I am going to leave you . There's no point in saying sorry or anything . I won't even say that I would never have made you happy . But I'm not a nice person . I thought we could have children . Reggie , darling , I'm 52 . That's extraordinary . You're like a young girl to me . Will I see you again ? No , I don't think so . Though you never know . It was that young bloody nephew of mine , wasn't it ? Sticking his nose in . It was actually Southgate who put me in the picture . Did it quite tactfully . Did he ? Well ... It's over now . You do look lovely , Liz . Please , Reggie , don't go on . I can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to rain all day . Nothing come of it in the end . What did you say to her ? Your nephew would have told her if I hadn't . She 'd have had to find out sooner or later . Only fair she should know . It's true , isn't it ? About the house . Of course it's bloody well true , you bloody idiot , but you didn't have to spill the beans ! She's gone now . Left me . She's gone abroad , my last chance of happiness . Perhaps you're better off without her . If she was only after you because she thought you was rich . Of course she thought I was rich , you bloody idiot ! Why else do you think an attractive girl like that would want me ? I never thought she loved me . But by God , I loved her , Southgate . What do you say to that ? No need to shout , sir . I'll shout if I like . Do you realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth ! - Just as well , by the look of you . - What ? Well , er ... I-I 'd better be off . He's ... a little bit upset . I'll be back tomorrow , sir . Now , wait a minute . I'll give you a hand . Thank you , Southgate . Home again , home again . Diggety-dig . Well ? - Missed your cooking , Southgate . - Good of you to say so . Though I don't remember it being as good as this . Special occasion , pulled out all the stops . - Found this wine in the cellar . - Did you ? Very nice too . Bloody hell , I've been saving that for my 70th . Three score years and ten . I think it's about time we started living for today , don't you , sir ? Put like that , Southgate , you're absolutely right . Here's to us . Cheers . The old firm back in business . Except ... we're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Well , here's to us , then . - How about a brandy ? - Better not . - Not after the wine . - You're the boss , Southgate . Tell you what , we'll have a bit of music . I was looking through your records , just yesterday . Remember this one ? Ahhh ... Moonlight Serenade , Glenn Miller , remember ? I should say so . We used to have a local hop at Biggin Hill , every Tuesday . - Come on , then . - No , I'm not up to it ! Of course you are . Like riding a bike . Up you get . I'll lead . Slow ... quick ... quick ... slow .

Fuck off . - My God . Look at his lip . - Check it out , nigga . Shut the fuck up , bitch ! Your lips are blue . Shut up ! You don't even know me , nigga . Look at this kid , yo . He's like a fiend . That's why I like this shit . They wake my brain up . There's more , man . - How many people live here ? - Too many . No , only eight or nine . Where does everyone sleep ? You homosexuals ? No , get the fuck out of here . Everywhere . It's a flophouse , man . We're still short on the rent . If we had a faggot , he 'd pay the rent . You and Casper can move in . You could share the bathtub . - I don't know about that . - Yo , Telly ... Jenny says , "" What's up ? "" Jenny who ? You know , Jenny . Casper : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her in forever . What's she up to ? I knew he wouldn't speak to me . That dick . You still mad at him ? Of course . How can I forgive him ? - What did he do ? - He stole her virginity . He took it away and now it's gone forever . It's not the fact that he devirginized me , it's that he never spoke to me again . He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out . But he was all like , "" Jenny , I like you so much , "" and ... "" I promise , I won't use you . "" Same lines . He was talking mad shit . The first time is always whacked . Be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the back seat of a car . - That's right . - That's nothing . I had just turned 14 . With this asshole who was 18 . I can't remember his name . This was at sleep away camp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bushes , around midnight . I got fucking mosquito bites all over my ass . I thought nobody knew about it , but everyone knew the next day . - And the pain was ... - Hell , yeah ! - The fucking pain ! Jesus ! - That's the shit . God , the pain ! The fucking pain ! Jesus ! You feel like you're being ripped open . You are being ripped open inside . - Did you bleed ? - No , I didn't . - You didn't bleed ? - I bled all over . On the condom , everywhere . You know what he started singing ? "" Sunday , Bloody Sunday . "" - "" Sunday , Bloody Sunday . "" - That stupid fucking song . I was like , "" What the hell ? "" I couldn't believe he did that to me . Then everyone at camp was singing that the whole time . You know what ? I have sex and I like fucking . Hell , yeah . I love sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . It's the best thing , right ? That's it . No , no , not sex . Foreplay . Foreplay . Hardcore pound fucking . That's the shit right there , man . That's the only way to do it . It's that boom , boom , boom . But there's a difference between making love ... having sex and then fucking . Right . Making love is like ... It's , like , sweet . It's real slow . Real slow . Sex is like , "" All right , let's have sex . Let's go , come on . "" Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's the whole thing . They want you to be so kind , so gentle , like you give a fuck or something . - What's up , Jav ? - What's up ? What are you doing with a cigarette ? Like you care ? Yeah , right . Most of the time , you just want to be all pounding that shit . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb . If you could just be like , "" Excuse me , miss , can I borrow your hole ? It'll only take a little bit . I'll give it right back . "" - Right . - "" I'm done . "" But that's it . You got to take it slow . You got to be smooth . Girls like it slow and romantic . Fuck romance . I like it hard and nasty . I've been with a lot of girls , so I know . Me too , nigga . What's up ? But it depends . I was at Eric's house . Smash J was there . D.J . Flipper was there . All right ? He was horny . He threw me on the bed . We started getting it on . They were in the room getting dressed . They were going to a disco . That shit was so good . He was fucking fingering me , sucking on my tits . I was like , "" You go , boy . "" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , our lips were busted . I was like , "" Work it , boy . "" But y'all know why I go out with Alex , right ? He has the best fucking fingers I ever had . I'm going out with him . He got it going on . That's that . That's why foreplay is better than sex . They can touch you and you're going crazy and all of a sudden , it's like , "" What the hell happened ? "" - J ust a big disappointment . - It's a letdown . Then it takes them either too long , or too short to come . Have you ever had someone who took forever ? What , to come ? Let me tell you . I was having sex with Jake , and it took my man an hour and a half . I don't have no hour and a half . No , no , no . You know what I notice , though ? Bitches love to suck dick . It's like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All bitches , man . I know , man , I'm telling you . Casper's right . They act like they don't in front of their friends , to try to get respect . When you get them alone , it's the first thing they go for . The girls just grab your dick , start sucking . They know they're in charge of something . Only time they feel prosperous . - I'm telling you . - They love that shit . That's why girls live longer than guys . Sperm's got vitamin C in that shit . The shit's nutritious , right ? Looking at your watch . You know what's the worst ? Sucking dick . I hate sucking dick . They'll be shooting you in the eye , and the ear and shit . And you don't know what to do . It hits that little thing ... the tonsils , the esophagus , whatever the hell it is . - You don't get anything out of it . - You'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You don't get shit . Have you ever swallowed it before ? No . Me neither . - I have . - Of course . No , but it was like ... No , it's like sweet and sour and salty butter . It's like ... it's just nasty . You drink and drink and you can not get ... the taste out of your mouth . The sperm get stuck in your teeth . They're disgusting . You got ta sit down and eat a whole real meal . All I know is that condoms suck . They don't work . They either slip off , or break , or make your dick shrink . You got a small condom , huh ? We still got to use them . I did once . Telly's the only guy I've had sex with . - I thought you had sex with A.J . - No , we just messed around . That's the whole thing , you know ? You hear of all these diseases . Disease this , disease that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up . I don't know no kid with AIDS . Ain't no one I know died from that shit . Fucking , that's just some make-believe story . It's bullshit ! We all going to die anyway . I'm going to go out fucking . - Yeah . - You know what I'm saying ? One guy got tested . He was negative . This other guy ... he 'd fucked only two other girls , and they were virgins , so he was safe . But then this other guy I just fucked , which was a mistake . Heat of the moment kind of thing . But I went to the clinic last week with Jenny ... to get ourselves checked , to be safe . Jenny went ? She got tested with me so that I didn't have to be alone . Word , they ask a lot of questions ? Jenny ... how old are you ? 16 . How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ? - One . - Were you protected ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 17 . How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ? Altogether ? Yes , altogether . I 'd say eight . Maybe nine . How many times did you go in unprotected ? Four times I went unprotected . Maybe it was three . Have you ever had anal intercourse ? No . Have you ever had anal intercourse ? Yeah . With how many different people ? I think three , but I'm not sure . Were they wearing condoms ? Yes , with two of them . Twice I didn't . I didn't ... two times . We're going to draw some blood from you . Come back in seven days ... and we should have the results of your tests , okay ? Thanks . You see that pork fried rice store ? The Chinese joint ? Yeah . My cousin lives right up there . He's mad . Crazy . His name is Harmonoff . One time we went to Special Olympics on a school trip . Seventh grade , whatever . He tried to pick up these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got a thing for them . He caught one dope bitch that day ... she had those leg braces and shit . But she had a fat ass . You're crazy . Ruthless . He brought her into the bathroom and fucked the shit out of her . He was telling me that the leg braces were scratching up his shit . He hit her hard , yo . She was all drooling and shit . So , he's pretty crazy ; he'll do whatever to bust a nut . - You know ? - That's ruthless shit . He wanted to take the leg braces off , but he was just like "" Fuck it . "" "" Let's hit this up real quick . "" Telly : Like quickie style . ? ? The summer's gone ? ? ? ? And all the roses dying ... ? ? Man , this guy's really good , yo . He reminds me of my uncle . - I bet he brings mad dough in , yo . - Hells , yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ? ? ? ? It's I'll be here ? ? ? ? I n sunshine or shadow ... ? ? I don't think I want to be seein ' him anymore . I want to date other people . I don't know . I think he's mad at me or something . But who cares ? It's like , "" Get off your high horse . If I want to see other guys I'll see other guys . "" So it's just like ... I can't deal with that jealous crap . I don't know why I see him in the first place . He's a jerk ! Giving me a hard time . That crap . I think I'm just gon na dump him completely . I was just tryin ' to be nice , but if he's gon na get ... It must have been something I ate . Ruby , follow me . - Wish me luck . - Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases and infections . Yes ! You're clean . I can't tell you how nervous I was . I didn't sleep last night . Now you have to be careful , Ruby , okay ? I want you to take these pamphlets and read them . And , Ruby , read them . Jenny , you've tested positive for the H IV virus . What ? The test isn't 100% accurate . I tested positive ? I'm sorry . I only had sex with Telly . I just came to keep Ruby company . Yo , I want to fuck Darcy . Who ? You know Darcy . Bennie's little sister . You like her , uh-huh ? Yo , I liked her for a while , yeah . Darcy , yo ? She's so little , innocent and pretty .

It's just the pain . When I was a kid ... it was all mental . Now it's all physical . Where are the flowers ? Don't fence the lillies . I'm sorry , Shorts . I'm sorry . I'm glad you came to see me .

Well , what are you going to do , sit out here all night long ? Lilli , if they didn't like your paintings ... why would they put you in the show ? Why ? Because the curator doesn't have a fucking clue . Or you know what ? Maybe he does have a clue ... but when he was picking out the paintings ... he was , like , sick that night and not paying attention . Or they're using my work ... to make somebody else's work look better ... like a conspiracy . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You're starting to make me look confident . Are you going to ... come inside ? Wait . Will you just wait here ? Lilli Black ... I 'd like you to meet Anne Friar from The New York Times . Congratulations . Thank you very much . I thought you might like to tell her ... a little bit about your paintings . I'm sorry . Could you excuse me ? It was very nice meeting you . You did it . Thank you . You know , I've spent my life ... trying not to feel ... stuffing everything deeper and deeper inside ... Pretending . Pretending about what ? That I feel fine ... That I'm OK . You know , coming here , pretending that ... That I'm OK that my father just died . I'm sorry ... about your father . Just don't pretend that you're not capable ... Because you are . Maybe your parents weren't . Do you know that I knew it ? I knew it when I met you . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk to you , so ... I'll just get the address and stop by the bar . OK ?

What do you want me to say , Jane ? Just say what you think , Rox . You always do . Fine . Ethan shouldn't have left Nate in the truck . It was stupid and careless , and what the fuck was he thinking ? It's his own fault . You could have some compassion . I do . I do have compassion , a truckload of it , for Nate .

Man on radio : District attorney Jack Craft will be holding a press conference later this morning in Angels Crest . It's expected that Mr . Craft will address the case of three-year-old Nathan Denton , who was found frozen to death last week after his father Ethan Denton had left him in the truck . I told them not to let anyone in yet , but ... you okay ? Yeah . It's smaller than I remember . - What ? - The coffin . - You went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll be fine . Maybe we should just postpone . No , no , no . How much time do we have ? - 10 minutes . - 10 minutes . ( @knock_on_door ) - Man : Jack . - Yes . Woman : District Attorney , any comment on the accusations ? Man : Mr . Craft , can you separate this case from your own past ? The state is filing charges against Ethan Denton for the death of his son Nathan Denton . Now , we are not claiming that Ethan Denton deliberately killed his son . However , his decision to leave the boy alone in a truck during a blizzard directly led to his death , and therefore constitutes an act of criminal negligence . Woman : Jack , are you the right man to be prosecuting ? - Thank you . - Jack , Jack , without being personal ... Jack , any correlation between this case ... I'm so sorry . Ethan , we need to talk . Okay . You keep in mind that I have never hated my job more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta take you in . For what ? Now , you'll be able to get a lawyer . Right now ? - Right now . - Okay . Okay . - Did you see Bill , Angie ? - Yeah . Has everybody lost their minds completely ? - It was an accident . - Calm down , Jane . - Nobody's saying it wasn't . - Ethan is a great kid . Why am I the only person who's angry about this ? He just should have taken better care is all . Hey , sweetheart . ( kisses ) I'm so sorry Mommy took such a long time . ( Childrenplaying ) ( trainhornblaring ) ? I wish I had a dime ? ? For every bad time ... ? ( Chatter ) Hi . I'm Jane Childs . I don't believe we've met . I'm Joanne Mills . It's nice to meet you . Are you a friend of ... I'm Cindy's mother . Oh , oh . I didn't realize Cindy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother , but I just ... It's so good to meet you . It's so good you're here . For Cindy . Can I get you anything ? Do you know where Cindy is ? What's that ? It's medicine . You have a tummy ache ? Yeah , something like that . So , you gon na go to the bathroom or what ? - I know how to go myself . - Good for you . I left Paul Jr . In the car once overnight when he was about Nate's age . Man : Really ? Crying like a banshee the next morning , but no worse for the wear . - Never told Donna . - Man : Smart . Of course , it was summertime . Wouldn't have left him out there in the winter . Yeah , so long as it was summertime . You poor thing . What you must be going through ... I can just imagine . But you rest assured , Nate is in a better place . ( gasps ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - She's just not herself . - Cindy : Oh , God ! Sit down . You came , huh ? I missed the funeral because you gave me the wrong time . You have very nice friends here . ( Scoffs ) The woman sewing coffee , she introduced herself . She was very nice . Jane ? - Yes , Jane . - She's a dyke . Jane says we need some more napkins . I'm getting them . I'm getting them . ( Grunting ) Hey , hey , whoa . I'll help , okay ? It's cool . It's not cool . I've been trying to call Ethan's dad for days , leaving messages , and I just don't understand why he's not here . Ethan needs someone . No , Ethan doesn't need his dad right now . - How do you know ? - I know Ethan . Look , maybe it's you that needs someone . All right . What ? I've got ta go . Rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Good , baby . Good , sweetheart . Oh . Hey , what's this ? What's this you're wearing ? I thought it was a wedding . Oh . Yeah , baby , it's ... it's not a wedding . Guard : You still play ball ? That's too bad . You were good . Oh , thanks , man . We got a softball league . Play against the fire department . It's not real or anything , but , you know , it's something . Right . You ever think of a career in law enforcement ? We could use an arm like yours . ( Scoffs ) Man on TV : Ethan Denton made bail this morning after pleading not guilty to the charges against him - for his role in the death ... - Not guilty , my ass ! I hope that jury fucking puts him away . Whatever happens , it's in the hands of the Lord now . That's supposed to be comforting ? What are you doing with my beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your god , I have mine . Denton will not be making a statement at this time . When will he be ready to make a statement ? ( Reportersclamoring ) - Hey , hey , hey . We're on your side , Ethan . Come on , just give us ... Rusty : Ethan . Hey , hold up . Come on ... Ethan . Shit . ( @horn_blaring ) ( brakessqueaking ) Hey , man . Where you heading ? Nowhere . You can crash at my place if you want or at the garage . We're closed down for the week . Whose idea was that ? Mine . - Hungry ? - No . - I can pick you something up ... - Where were you that morning ? What you talking about , man ? Come on , where were you ? Don't be stupid .

You know how close Nate was to the truck ? Less than a quarter-mile . ( Bottlehisses ) ( capclinks ) ( gunfire ) ( electronicbeeping ) - Dude , are you looking at my screen ? - I never , ever ... You were looking at my screen , man . Beer . Think they let you game in prison ? I'm just saying , I mean , no work , no bills , just you and the console . For five years ? Some games take five years , man . Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll let me out after three . ( laughing ) For good behavior ? ( @car_horn_honking ) - You want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Fuck . Fuck . - Oh , shit ! You crazy bitch ! Get the fuck out of here ! Get out of here ! Yeah , come on . Come on . ( grunts ) Not guilty , my ass ! ( grunts ) Is your dad alive ? No . I bet he was a good dad , though , right , when he was alive ? You being a lawyer and all , I imagine he 'd be real proud . Something like that . My dad's not dead . He's not proud , either . As a matter of fact , he's not even here . I don't blame him . He probably doesn't even know . That's why he's not here . My dad is a shit dad . But if he knew , I know he 'd be right here , digging up this grave with his fingernails , lifting Nate out from the earth , giving him mouth-to-mouth . He 'd try and bring him back to me . He would . Because what dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? I'm very sorry for your loss . What are you doing here ? - Here you go , number 21 . - That was fast . ( Cookchuckles ) Smells good . What can I get for you ? What's the special ? It's open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy . That sounds good . - To go ? - No . I 'd recommend it . Well , actually I was hoping to speak to you , Ms . Manning . One turkey . - I'm busy . To go . - Well , maybe another time . Oh , I'm always busy . Here you go , Frank . Sir . Yeah . You have any kids ? Once upon a time , yeah . ( @door_closes ) ( classicalmusicplaying ) ( vehicleapproaches ) Jane . - Hi . - Woman : Hi . Come in .

Why don't you take a little break , let me fix you something to eat ? You know , I locked the door when I got out . - I locked the truck . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high . I closed the door really fast when I got out s-so that it w-would stay warm . He was still warm when I left him . He didn't know how to get out of his seat . That's the thing ... he didn't ... didn't know how to do that . - I know , baby . - You know ? I know . ( Crying ) I know . It's not your fault . It's not your fault . What are you doing here ? I don't know . I couldn't think of anywhere else to go . Rosie's fast asleep . - How about I get you a cup of coffee ? - Yeah . I was with Cindy that morning . I know . I saw you there . Thanks . Oh , so you think that if you hadn't been there , maybe things would have been different . That DA came by here . The thing is , I never thought that Ethan was that great of a dad . No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , but there were always little things , like he would let him out of his sight for a moment too long or he would drink beer in the truck . And I never said anything . Never . ( bedthumping ) ( Melodygiggling ) - Oh , Jesus Christ . They're young . I 'd better not have to fucking listen to that every other night . We won't . They're leaving soon . He just wants money . Yeah , well , what did you expect ... love ? You left him when he was 10 years old . I know . ( sighs ) Can I help you ? Uh , I was just gon na take a closer look . That's why we have display models . I'm sorry . I'll put it back . Here , let me do that . Hey , you haven't had a recall on this item or anything , have you ? We wouldn't be selling it if there was a recall . Do you get many complaints ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beltclicks ) Or this , the latch , not staying buckled ? - Not that I know of . - Anything ? Look , why don't you just go online and look at some consumer reviews or something ? You know , that's a real good idea . Thanks . Woman over P.A . : Can I have a price check for Similac on aisle three , please ? I just need just a little bit of clarity here , because I'm trying to figure out what's happening . The insurance claim was denied ? - We don't actually know . - I think so , yeah . Ethan and Nate stayed with you guys , correct ? Yeah , the water damage destroyed the kitchen . It was inconvenient for them to stay there during construction , so , yeah , they stayed with us . - Well , who paid for the construction ? - Ethan did . He worked overtime to pay for it . He's a very hard worker . Because the insurance claim was denied ? I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The faucet in the tub was left on for hours . It was negligence . Thank you . - What ? - Nothing . What ? Speak your mind for once , please . - It's not really the time . - Why not ? Who gives a fuck what this guy thinks ? Say it . Ever since I told you George was coming , you've been a total cunt . Well , just give me one more question , you guys , and I'll get out of your hair . How long did Ethan and Nate stay with you guys after Ethan flooded the house ? Ethan didn't flood the house . He wasn't even there . Cindy was . ( @baby_crying ) - Joanne : You like it black ? - I do , thank you . Okay . Jack : Oh , I'm sorry if I woke you . Let me introduce myself . I'm Jack Craft . - This is the district attorney . - Nice to meet you . I need coffee . I had her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know if you're aware of this , but the state is prosecuting Ethan Denton for his role in Nate's death . It's Cindy . And I know all about the trial . I was wondering if you 'd be willing to help me . Like what ? Testify ? No , no , no . That's getting way ahead of ourselves . I was just trying to get some background information . Like what ? Like , you know , what kind of father Ethan was , you know , from your perspective . - My perspective ? - Yeah . ( sighs ) You may not be aware of this , but ... Fuck . But I have an itsy bitsy problem with alcohol . That's why Nate lived with Ethan in the first place . You're not the one that's on trial here ; Ethan is . You may be an alcoholic , but you're not the one who chose to drive your son into the woods in a snowstorm . You didn't , totally sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to track a deer ... a fucking deer . Excuse me . Ethan's actions would be more understandable ... not less negligent , but more understandable , had he been drunk at the time . That's a twisted fucking argument . Now , maybe he chose an inappropriate babysitter . Maybe he's done a lot of fucked-up things during his life . Maybe this isn't the first time that he chose hunting over taking care of his son . All I'm asking is for you to think about it , all right ? If something comes to you , if you remember anything , you simply write it down . I've taken too much of your time . Not at all . You ladies have a good morning . - Jack : Thank you so much . - Thank you . God be with you . Cindy : He seems really smart , doesn't he ? I guess . I think he's gon na put Ethan away . Maybe . Why didn't you give Nathan the birthday present I sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance . I was going to . Just , uh ... I saw it in the closet and I wondered . - I was going to . - I believe you . What did you give him ? Made to order . Oh , best thing I ever put in my mouth . - You want some ? - I don't do dick . - Hey , Ange . - Hey , Rusty . Can you take some food over to the garage for me , for Ethan ? Oh , now's not really a good time . No ? Okay , I'll have Rox take it over for me . So , can I get you guys anything else ? - Ethan . - Hi . Hi . - What are you doing here ? - I got ... Oh , this is Melody . She's the uh ... Knocked-up little girlfriend of Jane's homophobic son . Yeah . ( clearsthroat ) Hey , that's a cute seat . I was thinking of getting one . It's a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food for you . ( TVplayinginbackground ) I'll be right back . - What do you use ? - Bolt action , 30-30 . - Here you go . - Thanks . Can I buy you a cup of coffee ? Not in this lifetime . Just a heads up then ... you'll be getting a subpoena . All right . ( clearnsthroat ) I'm not testifying against Ethan . You were with him when he found Nate . All I expect you to do is describe that experience , that's it . - I can do that . - All right . I can tell about how I never saw a person so wrecked as Ethan when he dug up his son from the snow . I can tell the jury how much bullshit this trial is and how losing your own kid doesn't give you license to shit on the rest of us . I'll ask you how Nate was found , what he was wearing , how he looked when you saw him , the state of his toes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - You answer all my ... ( thuds ) ( @door_opens ) ( bucklesclicking ) Hey , man . Hey . I ... I just came by to say ... I'm sorry . You know , I'm just really sorry . For what ? For not being there when you called . For Cindy . It doesn't matter . It really doesn't matter . What you doing there ? I can't figure the goddamn thing out . I read online all these complaints about it , right ? Like , this one woman , she said that the buckle would just come undone . Like , it would just pop open after she buckled her kid in . So I kept taking the damn thing apart and putting it back together , and I can't find the glitch . What glitch ? You know , the glitch ... the glitch that , you know , makes the buckle come undone . ( sighs ) Okay . I have to ... I have to get this kind of evidence , you know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash at my place for a while ? No , no , no . No . I'm really fine here . I'm fine . Yeah , yeah , you know , I can see that , but , you know , I thought maybe you could use a fresh pair of eyes , you know . We can bring the car seat , work on it together . You 'd work on it with me ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah , sure . Come on . We'll go get some food , camp out at my place . It'll be great . - I don't know , man . - Dude ... this place reeks anyway , man , you know ? Man , come on . I don't even know what this is , you know ? It was once upon a time bacon , but now ... Jeez . All right . Thanks , man . All right . I'll get the seat . - You got it ? - Oh , yeah . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't know . It's been a while . - Oh , yeah ? First thing I'm gon na do is take a hose to that skinny-ass body of yours . - I just got ta lock up . - Okay . Ethan : See you there . ( Countrymusicplaying ) Whiskey ? - Hey , Cindy . - Hey . What are you doing here ? Same thing as you , I guess . Have you seen Ethan ? Not really . I thought you two were close . No , Jane's the one . But you used to take care of ... Sometimes , yeah . Was he good for you ? - The best . - Good . He was a good baby , too . He didn't cry too much . We 'd build forts in the living room with pillows and blankets and shit . He loved that . Yeah . That must have been fun . No , not really . I 'd set the pillows up , he 'd pull them down , throw them all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck over again , but it was fun for him . It's on me .

It was your choice to let Ethan have him . What did you want me to do ? What was I supposed to do ? ! ( Crying ) You should have let me have him . ( Crying ) Angie : Cindy ? Cindy ?

"
"@@4683259 As a child , you spent hours on this swing . Why the long face ? - Can I ask you a question ? - Sure . Did you have another love before grandpa ? He was the only man in my life . I married because I had no choice , but I learned to love him . Back then they said : "" A woman without a trade has two options : Marriage or prostitution . "" That's about the same . What if you could start anew ? - Would Pepe be the man of your life ? - No . If I could start anew I 'd get fucked as much as I could . Everyone should share your ideas . A man who gets laid is a super macho . If it's a woman , she's a slut . - Sexual equality . - Forget what they say ! If they made love more and spoke less ... - It would be better . - It's not that simple . What isn't ? Pay no mind , grandma . - It's hard to explain . - You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts , ideas , problems on a sheet of paper , but interrogatively so you can see them from outside and understand them . I did that at you age , and it helped a lot . And I still do , but so as not to forget . Dinner is ready . Come on . When you made love with grandpa , how was it ? You're very curious . Come , I've made shellfish meatballs for you . Enough for you to take to Barcelona . I lost my virginity on the 17th of July , 1993 , at 2:46 in the morning . It was during a vacation period , when I was 15 . You never forget a moment like that . - Are you okay ? - Yes . I remember I felt nothing , just deep shame for not having bled , and that strange feeling of having pissed in bed . I left with the excuse of the toilet , with the feeling my experience with Edouard couldn't be like that . A feeling that made me go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing here ? - Again . - Once again ? No , hundreds of times . Hundreds of times . That strange release of energy aroused in me a desire to communicate through my body , a curiosity to experience sensations through a kiss , a caress or the contact of my skin . 14 years after my first experience with Edouard I live in Barcelona and still have the same urge to experiment through my body . DIARY OF A NYMPHOMANIAC - My diary , it was here . - You're writing a diary ? - I follow your advice . - I didn't tell you to . Just to jot down your problems for a better perspective . Diaries are for lonely people . That's not true . They have something to tell . Because their life is different . And they always hope that someone will discover it , read it to get to know the true personality of the author . Right , because they feel lonely . It's the third blackout this week . - The dark still scares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't speak badly of me in your diary . Of course not . Could you write something for me ? That you're not alone , that I'm with you . It's about time . I'm unbearable in the dark . Unbearable . You smell of fields , of wet , recently cut grass . Why don't you stay over ? No , I can't . Tomorrow I have a meeting and must prepare my presentation . Alex , why don't you ever stay to sleep with me ? Please ? You don't want me to sleep . No . Don't you ever get tired ? Val , I can't keep up with your pace . Besides , I told you I have a meeting tomorrow . Come on . Hassan . Valerie . Nice to hear you . You disappeared into thin air but I found you ? I'll be in Barcelona this week . I want to see you ? - How about Thursday ? - Okay , I'll call you . A kiss . - Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I'll see him Thursday . Back to my desk , things are getting rough . What is ? They're restructuring . I've heard that ever since I'm here . Yeah , well ... I've been asked what I feel when I make love . It's like a mix of energy with the other person that makes me fly and merge with the cosmos . The energy of my orgasm is a small part of me that goes and ends up mixing with the universe . A sidereal trip that takes me to infinity . In my country they say Allah told the south wind that he 'd create the Arabian horse from it . "" So be it "" , said the wind . He held a puff and tied it to the horse's mane so it wouldn't forget where it came from , but it turned out to be so fast and cunning that no one could ride it , and it was Ishmael , the first faithful , who was able to tame one of them and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to tame than that first horse . I don't know how to name you . Are you calling me wild ? Yes . I think I've never fucked you in a bed . We can do that now , if you want . Although ... I've just had a better idea . Here , look . Where are they ? You've hidden them again ? No . Not now , Hassan , please . I don't feel like it right now , not today , no . Here they are ! No , please . No . Not today . Yes , yes , today . Look , look , come on . Good morning . Be careful , Val , you're late again . Want one ? I don't want to even see them , I need coffee . I bought a dress for Marcos ' wedding . When I tried it on I realized I couldn't zip it up . So I cried like a baby and then I called you . You knew about Hassan . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . I'm thinking of publishing an ad to find a boyfriend . An ad ? What do you mean ? You have to stop being obsessed . How can you find him not going out ? I don't want just one-night stands . You must try before falling in love . I need to fall in love , Val , find a man who loves me and perhaps buy me flowers now and then . I rather he fucks well . I'll buy the flowers . I can't stand not having anyone to talk to at home , to wake up alone and find half a lemon in the icebox . Love fills iceboxes and mine's been empty for a long time . I was worried . You didn't call yesterday to say good night . I got home late . I had dinner with some friends . - Did you like the meatballs ? - Yes , delicious . I'm hanging up . I must finish your sweater ? - I love you , I love you . ? - Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What ? - Tame me . You deserve some flowers . I want to fuck all night long . I can't . I can't . I can't , Val . - I have to go . - What's the matter ? No , Val . Val , Val , Val , Val . I have to tell you something . - You have a girlfriend . - You knew ? I imagined but , don't worry , I'm not jealous . Besides , I never asked you if you were alone . It's not my problem . I didn't think you 'd take it like that . You wanted me to cry ? Val , we must stop seeing each other . I want to fly . Val , Val , Val . Haven't you understood ? Can't you think of anything else ? You got a problem . You can't spend all day thinking about fucking . I do , but you're an S.O.B .. Don't ever call me again , okay ? Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loneliness , the silence . I need some air . What ? Are you new here ? This is my turf , baby ! Beat it ! Go work somewhere else . Some days I 'd spend hours in the shower , feeling the water , forgetting everything . But I can't get Alex off of my mind . I liked him a lot . Like him , many others just want to fuck me , and I like that , but it hurts because , above all , I'm a woman . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . It's not fair , Val , they're pigs . You give them part of your life , and they fire you . Want a hand ? Forget it , I was fed up anyway . Weren't you on a diet ? How can I be being so depressed ? You get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valerie can't attend to you , she no longer works here . Bye . Yes ? Speaking . I got furious when I found out they called you . Thanks for coming , but there's no need . I got a few days vacation at work . I 'd have come anyway . Don't look like that , Val . I've no intention of dying so soon . It was just a slight problem . My heart is holding out . Doctors always exaggerate . - What is wrong with you ? - Nothing . Val , I know you well . Is it over a man ? One ? Over all of them . Do you know what nymphomania is ? I think that's my problem . I can't control it . I need sex . I see a man and I need him . But no one understands that . People stare at me . It happens with strangers that don't attract me . I'm scared . Scared of not being like other women . Scared of being hurt someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not having a family . Nymphomania , a man's invention to make women feel guilty if they break the rules . Everyone is the way they are . Never give up anything you really long for because you'll regret it . Believe me . To me , I think that you don't dare to live your life . Want a piece of advice ? Enjoy life as much as you can . And go get my sweater , I want to finish it . You should rest , grandma . I've rested enough . Go on and get my knitting . Go on . CALL VAL I've lost the only person who understood me . I feel absolutely alone . I 'd like to have the company of a man to comfort me , but I haven't the strength to go looking for him . I'm exhausted . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . Darling , I was calling to say good night , but I guess your out having a good time ? You are so right ! Enjoy it while you're young ? Bye . A kiss . I called you a lot . You could at least answer . What happened ? I know that my sex life is harming me , and that I can't go on like this . Although I'm sunk , I'm looking for work . Okay , you're the person I need . You speak English , you have knowledge of marketing . We sell a lot to France , and you 'd take care of our communications , go with me to fairs , and have a ham for Christmas . - A ham ? - I give them to my employees . You can't say we foreigners don't integrate . Interested ? I have another interview today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Okay . I see you're very observant . You see , we're moving . Why did you quit your last job ? They cut down on personnel , including me , Mr ... Rijas , Jaime Rijas . What ? Rijas and Associates , general manager . You're a graduate in business administration and applied foreign languages . A really impressive curriculum . - May I ask you something ? - Sure . - Are you married ? - No . Engaged ? I think that is irrelevant . Yes , you're right , but in this job one must travel the world over . There's no commitment on my part . Would you like to ask me anything else on the salary , or whatever ? What perfume do you use ? Well now , you really have a very , very good sense of smell . It's a special lavender perfume . Yes ? Valerie ? Yes , speaking . It's Jaime Rijas ? How are you ? Oh , hello . I've made a decision , but have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . What sort of problem ? I think I can speak openly to you . Would you mind talking about this over a drink ? Can't we do that in your office ? I 'd prefer a quieter place ? My secretary interrupts constantly . I'm 39 and have always been a businessman with clear ideas , but nothing like this had ever happened to me before . And I thought it was important to talk about it with someone without prejudice , and you're that person . Why ? You hardly know each other . Precisely because we don't know each other at all , your opinion will be more objective . That all depends . I met a woman at work and , due to my status as director general , I don't know what to do . I've always controlled my impulses but his thing , - it's getting out of hand . - She works in your company ? Not yet . Does she know ? She's smart and I think she has realized there's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m afraid she may not feel the same for me . Sorry . Did I step on you ? - The table's small . - That's okay . You're beautiful , Valerie . I 'd like to buy you a rose , but I have no money . Or do I ? I forgot to tell you something . The job was yours until this evening . But from now on I don't think I couldn't order you around . - Good night . - Good night . Any relatives ? Two grown boys , but he's been separated for years . Isn't he too old for you ? He's the smartest man I've ever met . He's intelligent , polite , cultured , caring . He's got it all . I had never felt like this before . When I see him my heart leaps and his hands drive me crazy . Val , you , in love ? As a child I 'd let my balloons go . I liked to watch them rise . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m in love , but I like him a lot . He's different from all the other men . Maybe you too were born for matrimony . Not so fast . I feel a normal woman for the first time in my life , a feeling that fascinates me , to be like all other women I meet . I see Jaime nearly every day . I realize I've discovered something as important as sex . The love of a man . I have fallen madly in love for the first time in my life . He takes me to the best places , and always picks me up . In his Jaguar ? I 'd like that , really . A boyfriend with a Jaguar . And how is he in bed ? I don't know yet . You're in love ! Jaime , you need to use a condom . Really ? I want to feel you . - Is it necessary ? - Yes . Okay , no problem . I'll go get one . And while you're at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caress me . Sorry I was so fast , but I've had a tiring day . Don't worry . It's okay . Could you leave the light on ? You should fear nothing now , you have me . And tomorrow will be a very , very special day . You'll see . Today we finally made love . I hardly felt anything , like the first time with Edouard . But I love him and he loves me . That's the most important to me . - It's marvellous . - Yes . The office . Don't look , it's all a mess right now . I'm living a marvellous dream with Jaime from which I don't want to wake . A room with a view , wooden floors . Nice ? The corresponding full bathroom , and here is our bedroom . Look , and the bathroom ... This closes completely . Black out , really . It's the perfect size . 3 bedrooms . Yes , our room , the office downstairs , and another for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said you wanted children soon , but don't take that as pressure , please . The windows are 6 stories tall . I've always dreamed of a view of the sea , but it's too expensive , darling . Don't you worry , okay ? That's up to me , and period . And how is he in bed ? Truthfully , nothing out of this world . He comes too fast . He says he works too much . You always said sex is most important . Maybe because I wasn't in love . Val , I think it's a bit soon to go live together . You haven't been going out long . You said I should change my life , and I'm doing just that . Being with him , I feel , for the first time , no need for anyone else . Besides , I'm nearly 29 . Maybe I should think about having kids . - So that's it . - One of many reasons . A man who doesn't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay , pay no mind to me . I'm going through bad times . - Will you take him ? - Yes . - Can you zip me up ? - Sure . - What are you looking at ? - The icebox . - What's wrong with it ? - I love it . Do you love me as well ? With that dress on , you look beautiful . To you ? Are you okay ? Of course I am , but I feel a bit uncomfortable . You're paying it all . You spent a fortune on furniture . What good is money if you can't spend it ? When you find a job , we'll talk about this again . See anything ? It's beautiful . Thanks , Jaime , but you can't pay it all and give me these gifts . It's to say I love you . Sorry , did I step on you ? The table's small . What a son of a bitch ! What ? There's no need . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many men . I don't want to think about that now . You're mine only . Mine only . Don't talk . What are you doing ? Embrace me . Aren't you afraid ? Not any longer . Yes ? - Valerie ? - Yes , speaking . - Hi , it's Harry . - Hi , Harry . Could I see you this morning ? Sure , I'll be there in half an hour . See you . I hired a girl , but she was a disaster . She didn't last a week . If you're willing , you could start right now . Right now ? Yes , I need someone urgently . We present the collection in 3 weeks . We're up to here . We haven't spoken about money yet . A ham for Christmas . Right , Maite ? - A client is waiting . - I'll be right there . Thanks . Don't worry about money . We'll reach an agreement . Coffee ? Hello . I have very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . - What ? I called your cell phone but it was off . - Harry wants me to start right ... - Harry ? - They're ... - Who the fuck is Harry ? The boss , an Italian . I've been hired by a fashion firm . An Italian ? He hired you just like that ? Not knowing how you work ? How weird . Isn't that weird ? You're still young and have a lot to learn . What's wrong ? I thought you 'd be happy about my job . And I am . I am happy , but I didn't expect it , and that's why I reacted that way . But I am happy . Forgive me . Really , forgive me . That night , that marvellous dream I thought I was living began to turn into a nightmare . I just give an account that I did not know the person of which I had fallen in love . When the catalogues ? They should be printed tomorrow . You do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patience ! - What's going on ? - I'll bust your chops ! What are you doing here ? So , you're the one who wants to fuck my wife ? Why is she here so late ? You think I don't know what's going on ? You think I don't know ? Jaime , go home . I'll be there soon . Right away , darling . Wait for me . I'll wait outside . Get up . Come on , get up . How are you ? Did you sleep well ? Darling , you know what I've thought ? That we could both use a trip . Forgive me , my love . Forgive me . Truthfully , I am very stressed . I can't forget my problems . We'll go on vacation , and we'll be fine . Don't touch me ! It would be best for us to separate . Separate ? My darling , we can't separate . I can't live without you . If you leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little love , please . You have to understand me . Give me a chance , I'm in bad shape . Jaime , you're not well . You're a compulsive liar , your moods are unpredictable . You're aggressive , you come to work and show me up . You're not acting in a normal way . - You need to see a doctor . - I'll do as you wish . Whatever you want , but don't leave me . Please , you can't leave me . I need you . - When did you get here ? - Today . You're unrecognizable . You know what I'm thinking about ? Kuhaylan . Remember ? The first Arabian horse . I think than man learned to tame it . Honestly , you're unrecognizable , Valerie . You need to be alone . Look at me . You know you can always count on me . People don't change , but I had hopes of doing so with Jaime . Sonia was right . I'm blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can't go on . All I want to do is lose consciousness , disappear from this world . Oh , Val , Val ! Why don't you take a vacation ? It would do you well . I appreciate it . You're right , I can't work like this . I can't concentrate . And don't forget to take the ham . Hit him with it and make it look like an accident . Were you not gay , you and I would be together . Oh , Madonna ! Yes , yes , that's it . Do it . Don't stop . Darling , look , I have a Christmas present for you . - What's your name ? - Vane . Vane , this is Val . Val , this is Vane . We make up a perfect team . Come here , my love . Come here , love , come here . Please , come here . We could have a great time . - What's your name ? - Vane . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here . Come , my darling . What tits , huh ? What tits ! The biggest thing you've got , bitch . You've got a piercing , huh ? That's enough . Get off , off , off ! Where's my money ? I have no cash , you know ? - Where are my 100 euros ? - I don't know . I have no idea . Jaime , we're expecting a baby . What ? We're expecting a baby . That's impossible . Why is it impossible ? I don't doubt you're expecting , I doubt it's mine . How can you say that ? You know why I doubt it ? Because I'm sterile for many years now . You laid someone else and want to dump it on me . You're a monster . And you are a hysterical piece of shit . I've always wanted to tell you this . You're a whore ! You lie all the time , like all whores ! I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the conversation is over . Don't cry , you pig . Don't cry , pig . A baby is what I most wanted in this world . You did right , Val . You're still young for having kids . I don't know what to do now . I quit my job , spent my savings and , thanks to him , I'm in deep debt . I paid the rent for months . Well , don't worry . What , what is going on here ? Can't you see ? She is leaving . What , you're clearing off ? My love , - I beg you , baby . - Leave her alone . If you walk out that door , I swear I'll kill you . Understand ? I'll kill you , you hear ? I am going to destroy you , bitch ! - You hear ? - I'll call the cops . This is fuckin ' shit ! Let's go , Val , we're out of here . I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll change , my love . Forgive me , my love . You can't go , my love . You won't get away from me , you hear ? Whore ! No one leaves me , you know ? No one leaves me , you bitch ! You're coming to my place until you get over that son of a bitch bastard . Val ? Hello . Val . Val , you can't go on like this . Val , you have to react . You look terrible . How long have you been here ? Oh , my baby ... I'll help you clean all this up . Look , I've brought food . Come on . Breaking off with Jaime nearly cost me my life . Seeing the depths of the pit , I want out and to see the light again . After several months without an orgasm my body was beginning to rouse . It was like waking from a long , eternal lethargy . I'm starving . I know what I will do to quench my appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I made a mistake . - No , it's here . Come in . Come in . - You're Val , right ? - Yes . You called for the interview . - I'm Cindy . One of the girls . - It's a pleasure . You'll be attended to right away . - Cristina . - Val , Valerie . Valerie ? A nice name . Let me have a look , please . Thanks . Have a seat , Val . - Where have you worked ? - In this ? Yes , of course . This is my first time . Interesting . What can you do ? Everything , as long as it's with a condom . That's fine . Go with Cindy . Use more make-up . Clients don't pay for what they have at home . - I think I found a job . - Tell me about it . For what company ? In a brothel . Come on , Val , that's not funny . I start tomorrow . - Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time waiting . Want to see the man of my life ? His name is Migue . He lives with my mother near Rio . I sent him there because his father is a bastard . I take all this for him , but I can't go on . I must whisper . These walls have ears . Come on , girls , let's dance . Are you going to behave ? Cindy . I'm Mar . I'm Stephanie . - What's your name , child ? - Laura . I'm Val . Val , I want you . - What do I have to do ? - That's up to you , but he's always high . He can not have full sex . A good hand job will make him happy . A two-hour hand job ? You know , you play a little , massages ... This is no school , Val . The client isn't going to gobble you up . You look beautiful . Hi . You're new , aren't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come here . - You have a special smell . - Really ? You like it ? - Let's go to bed . - No . Let's stay here . Fucking doesn't turn me on . Okay , relax , we'll see what can be done . Well , I'm from Seville . I work for a machine company that sells throughout Europe . Fuck ! Stop , girl , or I'll go crazy . Why the fuck did you stop ? Because you told me to . You pay no attention to me . Keep going , shit ! No one's ever done this to me before . - Did you go to the April fair ? - No . You know what's happened to me all of a sudden ? - I've fallen in love with you . - But we just met . That's right , love at first sight . Why don't we get into bed ? Okay , but just because I love you . What a nice ass you've got ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment I felt a strange feeling . The same as at 15 , with Eduard . I needed to know more , to learn from this world I just entered . What are you doing ? The first time is tough , I know . We have all cried the first time . But you get used to it , it becomes an exercise . - Are you okay ? - Of course I am . - Where's my money ? - Here you are . - How did it go ? - Fine , but a bit of a pain . You expected a cultured , interesting man with a pleasant conversation ? I remind you you're a whore . You look tired . Not at all , I'm delighted . What do clients like ? A bit of everything . Some want to tie you up , others stick things in you . You just gave me an idea . That handsome is he ! His name is Giovanni . He's Italian . The other one's a pig . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll be right out . Come on , you look divine . It was a pleasure to meet you . I hope you enjoyed it . What an intense life . I would like mine to be that way too . What's your name ? Valerie . I have a strange feeling that here , somehow , time stands still . You're just learning to be who you are . What about you ? You are the future of my past . And me , perhaps , the memory of your future . It's not a difficult job , just different . How can you say that ? I like to do it free , you know that . And I get paid , what else could I want ? - Have you ever been spanked ? - What ? Try it . You 'd be surprised . We have too many preconceptions . And those flowers ? A present from Pedro , a client . - They're pretty . - Yes . Still thinking of Jaime ? Not at all . I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Val . I've seen that look before . - Keep it . - No . Don't be silly . Yes , Cristina ? Okay , I'm on my way . It's Giovanni . Giovanni is different from all other clients I've met . I shivers when he touches me . He makes me go to the cosmos , see stars . I think I'm in love with him . Thank you . I live in Calabria because mama lives there . I spend most of the year travelling . - What ? - Your left eyebrow . - What's wrong with it ? - I like it . That uncombed hair . You know ? I communicate better with my body than with words . With a caress I describe things that make me feel alive . I'm scared , Giovanni , I like you too much . Your smell is irresistible . - What smell ? - The Mediterranean , freshness , life . I like you too much too . - Give me your phone number . - I can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss should pay you more . Will you call me again this week ? Do you want to know the answer ? Look , this proves that I will call you again . Save it for me , and take good care of it . I have to go . Your time's up . Although I 'd like to sleep with you ... What did you say ? Nothing , forget it . What about the money ? I'm a disaster . What if I pay you another hour ? This one is on me . Val , be very careful . Don't fall in love with him . It's sheer logic . It's impossible for a man who goes with whores to be loyal . Believe me . Valerie , you're beautiful . Your new job suits you . Although I'm jealous of the other men . When does your plane leave ? - In 3 hours . - Why , why don't you stay ? I have to go to Madrid . We could order a Coca-Cola and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m thirsty again . I guess you'll give me a good discount . A Coca-Cola and an opener , please . Don't you like it ? Of course I like this suite but I don't want to be your fiance , Pedro . Val , listen to me . I'll do whatever you want for you to love me . And I won't say a word while we're fucking . What I want is for you to marry me . Look , this is for you . Fuckin ' look at it . - You don't like it ? - No . I was given a similar one once . I can't accept it . Don't give me anything . And no flowers , I hate flowers . Pedro , you're pressing me . Go see some other girls . What are you saying ? I don't want others , I want you ! You're hurting me . I won't marry you . You're drunk . - I had better go . - Go , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what this room costs me ? I pay you , and you'll do as I say . You understand me ? Here's your fuckin ' money . Pick it up . Pick it the fuck up ! Stay there on all fours . Stay there on all fours . Yeah . - You're hurting me ? - Do you like it ? Now you'll ask me to spank you , like you've always done . You like that ? Bitch , you're a real bitch . You're hurting me . Please , Pedro . What are you complaining about ? What ? You chose to be a whore . You'll do as I say , in one way or another . Tell me you like this . No , please ! You like this ? I love you , Val . And you , what a view ? That night I understood , what grandma said , prostitution and marriage aren't that different . You become the property of someone else . And when they're like Jaime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he would kill me . There are many Pedros in this . Go , you're still in time . After , it's difficult to drop it . You could go to Rio and give my son an enormous kiss . Now go home . You look tired . I don't want to be alone . Hi , you've got a client , and there aren't that many Pedros . I'm sorry , I can't go . I haven't slept for nights . - And I have a date . - I'll go . You're going nowhere . Who's the date with ? You're committed to me . I 'd go if I were you . It's the Italian , your friend . - Giovanni ? - Yes , and his friend . Mae and you will go right now . Cheers ! - Hi . - Hi , darling . Come on , princess . I've finally convinced Giovanni , the ' macaroni ' , that you 'd be mine tonight . Come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you're here . What a pain of a whore ! I couldn't stop thinking about Giovanni . I couldn't believe he didn't pick me . I felt disgust while Alejandro fucked me . Cindy was right saying I should quit prostitution . I could still do that . But Cindy was trapped . She owed Cris a lot of money , and she was infatuated with her . She couldn't stand not having her son . What happened ? Cindy . She foll out the window . A suicide , we think . She got a call . Seems like her husband took the boy , but we know nothing more . Cindy would never leave her son . We buried her the next day , just the girls from the brothel . I was devastated . I can't stop thinking about Cindy . We're all sorry about Cindy , but life goes on , and the job that feeds you as well . I'm not going . Yes you are , darling . Hello ? Hello . - Hi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . - That's okay . - What's your name ? - Valerie . I'm Inigo . Delighted . Could you pick me up and put me on the bed ? I could do that but it takes me a great effort . Have no fear . I feel absolutely nothing . No , you don't need to undress me . The only place I feel anything is my neck . And my hands a bit . - You smell nice . - What do I smell of ? - Chocolate . - Chocolate ? Could you do me a favour ? Move your fingers . Come on , Valerie , Move the fingers of your hand . For you it's easy . I am incapable of moving a single finger . You don't know how many times , suddenly , I imagine me hands and my fingers start to move , and I get up off the chair and I start to run . I can tough the flowers , feel the velvet , and caress a woman as beautiful as you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you're still in time . After , it's difficult to drop it .

I do care about what is said . Clear out ! Give me the bag ! You whore ! Go on , get out of my sight ! You're unbearable ! We always realize things when it's too late . Since the accident , whenever I see anyone , I give them advice . What advice ? To take advantage of their life every day , but truly . Live . You need to be alone . Enjoy life as much as you can . And I can touch grass , feel velvet . I slowly started to caress my body . I had finally discovered what road to follow . That of being myself . Although it was pouring rain , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment with who 'd always been by my side . What are you doing here ? I know I'm unpresentable . Congratulations ! - Are you okay ? - Better than ever . I wanted to thank you . For what ? For being my friend , for your advice . I always follow your advice . I've decided to leave the brothel . I'm so happy . I'll spend some time with Hassan . Won't you open your present ? It's beautiful ! It has no zipper . Now I don't have that problem . He helps me . This is Marcos . We met through an ad . - Hi , Marcos . - Hi . - I'm glad for you . - Come in and change . - No , I have to go . - What will you do now ? Live . I'm a promiscuous woman , yes , because I want to use sex as a means to find what everyone is looking for . Recognition , pleasure , self-esteem and , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to give me a name , go on , I don't mind .

It's impossible for a man who goes with whores to be loyal . Valerie ... Live .

' ' Krystal's phone . ' Um ... May I speak with Krystal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For how long ? ' Who's calling ? ' Thomas Tatless . ' She won't be back any time soon . Do you have a message ? ' No . Um ... No , thank you . May I join you ? No . I asked you not to meddle in this process , and you completely ignored me . And I know you are using Laura . Come on , Henry . She was hardly going to sleep with you . DRINK POURS What is it you are advising the PM on ? Stability in the institutions , keeping an eye on the long-term objective , peace . Usefully vague . And is she heeding your advice ? So , how do you think the commission is going ? Apart from yesterday's incident , not bad . Unfortunate , that . Yes . The case of Connor Roche is soon to come before you . The Roches have asked you to expand the witness list . Fully within the terms of my remit . No-one is disputing that . Good . Did you tell Laura that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind ? God , Henry . You can't account for every casual remark . - I'll take that as a yes . - When is your daughter's baby due by the way ? I understand she and Maria Roche know one another . What's so special about Francis Gilroy ? He is not responsible for Connor Roche's disappearance . Yes , so Sinn Fein said . Do you take their word on that ? We all want the Roches to have closure . It's such a stupid word , that , don't you think ? So the man who actually pulled the trigger will attend the commission but it would be best if that were the end of it . What is it you don't want the world to know , Jake ? Anything that might destabilise the extremely hard-won peace . The Roches deserve the truth . The truth is Gilroy may have been an idiot once but compared to most of them he's Mahatma Gandhi . The truth is he's one of the reasons most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is none of us much fancies the alternative . Is that your advice ? You have a friend named Krystal . Someone paid her to set you up but because my interest is stability in the institutions I intervened . - Intervened ? - She works here illegally . She has a six-year-old son . She wasn't difficult to persuade . - Where is she ? - That ... You don't need to know . If she contacts you again or refers to these again she'll be deported . Did you do this , Jake ? With Gilroy's handlers . They are keen to make a point . Well , it'll take more than a few embarrassing photographs to stop this commission . Exactly what I told them , which is why we're not sitting here watching the live version of these on YouTube . Believe it or not , Henry , I am trying to save lives , not just protect reputations . But do try to be a little more careful with what passes for your sex life . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RINGS - Laura . - ' Some news . The police have had a change of heart . ' They've offered up ex DI James Fenton though they're denying - ' he recruited Connor Roche . ' - And Gilroy ? ' They've named the man they say shot Connor . ' And it's not Francis Gilroy ? ' Someone called Michael Madden . Shall I tell the Roches ? ' No . Not yet . - You see much of Jake ? - ' He phoned . ' He said you and he had had a drink together . - ' He 'd forgotten how much he enjoyed your company . ' - That was kind of him . - ' I was quite jealous . ' - Good night , Laura . - Mr Stanfield ? - Sir . - It's all right , Beckett . Stay where you are . - My name is Fenton . - Yes , I know who you are . - What do you want ? - Strike me from the list ? That's not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So tell the truth . They're not going to let me tell the truth . They 'd destroy me first . Please , Mr Stanfield . We all have to make our own choices , Mr Fenton . This is not my choice . I heard shots . I ran from the house . Seamus was lying there in the cold . Blood was pouring from his forehead . Two members of the UDA were convicted of his murder ... .. but released after the Good Friday Agreement . My family and I would like to hear what they have to say . Thank you , Mrs Benson . Jake , you told me Krystal was out of the equation and now she shows up at the tribunal . So what is this ? Am I fighting on two fronts here ? Because if you think this is the way to spare Gilroy's blushes , trust me , I'll make it a lot worse for him and for all of you than a few photos of me making a bloody fool of myself . Call me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I was in at the tribunal . If you don't mind me saying , you seem to be in a bit of a state . I'm not sure what was going on in there but I don't want my brother's hearing to be like that . How do you know Anna Connelly , the Sinn Fein lawyer ? She came into the chamber just now with some other woman . I've met a lot of lawyers since I came here . Do you like the truth , Truth Commissioner ? - Truth is rarely pure and ... - And never simple . Yeah , I know . - But it's what gets me out of bed at the morning . - Yes , I can see . I'll make sure Anna Connelly will not humiliate my family even if you won't . I'll see to it that she won't . It's Henry Stanfield . I 'd like to speak to Francis Gilroy . TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT So , Michael , I was very sorry to hear about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do what we tell you , you'll be back in Boston before you know it . The salmon are back . That was a filthy pond when I was a boy . Do you know this woman ? - No . - She turned up at the commission yesterday - with your Ms Connelly . - And ? - No , I didn't think you knew . - This is not my doing . I'm sorry . Who's Madden ? - He's nobody . He was a boy . - So why him ? - He was there . And did he kill Connor ? The Roches want a name . A guilty man . - That's what you promised them , isn't it ? - They seem to want you . Those photographs are for Jake Marston's benefit . - What does that mean ? - They make it seem like they're serious about protecting me . - A man Dublin and London could deal with . - And ? Some of my colleagues are protecting themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop them ? - I won't name names . I think you'll let Madden take the rap because it's the least worst option for you . I didn't kill Connor Roche , but you drag me before the commission , it'll be as if I did . No-one will benefit except those who replace me . How many times in how many countries have I heard that speech ? You must do what you have to do , Mr Stanfield . I always knew my job was a poisoned chalice . What about yours ? CAR ENGINE STARTS - Interesting . - He's old school . He won't be pleased about the photographs . Send Mr Stanfield the other images . MOBILE PHONE BEEPS - ' Dad . ' - Emma . - ' Dad , what's it ? What's wrong ? ' - I'm sorry to wake you . - ' No , no , I was ... What's wrong ? ' I ... I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice . Make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . I'm fine . ' - Right . - Emma ? - ' What is it , Dad ? ' It's ... nothing . Goodnight . Prime Minister , I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation . I have a daughter who's moved here . She's pregnant , vulnerable . I can not guarantee her safety . I realise your personal investment in this . Yes , you made it very plain . This is to be your legacy . Just let me try to explain . No , of course not . No , I haven't . Not yet . Yes . All right . All right . PHONE RINGS Yes , what is it ? - Henry , are you all right ? - What is it , Laura ? I'm sorry to pressure you but you need to make a decision on Gilroy . You need to know now ? Yes , the Roche case has been moved forward to Thursday . Hello . Take Gilroy off the list . Let's see what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Yes . OK . Sleep well . It's the right choice . Believe me . KNOCK ON DOOR - Is everything all right ? Emma ? - She's fine . There's a guard at the house . I know the men on duty . Very discreet . She's in good hands . I was told to give this to you . It was left at the commission for you . - Can I offer you a drink ? - Thank you . But I 'd better get back . - Good night , sir . - Goodnight . When we get there stay close to me . Keep your head up and look straight ahead . Keep everything for the commission . And remember , we're here for you , shoulder to shoulder . Maria Roche wants me to call the man responsible for Connor's death before the tribunal . Yes . I can't give the Roches what they want . Why not ? Threats have been made . Threats ? What kind of threats ? They've made it plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gilroy ? The Minister ? - You have to call him . - Emma ... I'm not risking you or my grandchild for a truth commission , - not even this truth commission . - See this as an opportunity , Dad . A chance to do something that matters for those you say matter to you . I won't make pointless grand gestures . OK , so when the truth doesn't suit you , it's a pointless grand gesture . You owe this to me . You owe it to my mum . And if you ever , ever hope to see him , you owe it to your grandchild . Do not pass up on this chance . There won't be another . Michael and I have been working on the events that led to the unfortunate death of Connor Roche . Michael ? Connor was passing information about Republicans to the police . He 'd been seen with the Special Branch so he was to be taken over the border and questioned about it . I drove the car for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no-one heard him . He freely admitted what he had been doing . It was decided to set up a press conference where he 'd describe how he was recruited by the police and passed information . But early next morning , he somehow managed to climb out a window . I was supposed to be watching him . I had a gun . I panicked , I chased after him into the woods . I shouted after him that he 'd get me in big trouble , not to be stupid . All of a sudden , he was on top of me , punching and kicking me . I was on the ground . I tried to push him off . But he gets hold of the gun ... He was trying to wrestle it off me . And then ... - I don't know how ... - GUNSHOT ECHOES .. but the gun went off . And he stopped moving . It was a terrible accident . I'm sorry for what happened to Connor . I'm truly sorry . Very good , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , Anna ? I had no idea they 'd put so much pressure on you not to call Gilroy . I'm sorry if I ... Where's Francis Gilroy ? They sent him instead . Sure , he was only a child himself . - ( They're not sending Francis Gilroy . - What's going on ? ) I 'd ask everyone to stand in silent memory of all those who lost their lives in the conflict . Thank you . I'll begin by asking Maria Roche if she would tell us about the events leading up to her brother Connor's disappearance . When Connor disappeared , he was 15 years old . It was a Thursday night . He said he was going down to the boxing club . He didn't come home . When another day passed , we went to the police . They told us they believed he 'd been abducted by the IRA . A few days later , word reached us . A neighbour said that Connor had been supplying information to the police and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape . How could Connor work for the police ? What did he know about anything ? Years went by and nobody was able or willing to tell us anything . It was as if he never existed . But we have a right to know , to have his body back where he belongs . Thank you , Miss Roche . The commission calls James Fenton . Please state your name and your connection with the case . James Fenton , Detective Inspector . Special Branch , RUC . Retired . When did you first encounter Connor Roche ? I can't remember the exact date , but towards the end of January 1992 . Connor was suspected of involvement in petty crime , making a nuisance of himself . So we picked him up . He denied any wrongdoing . We had no evidence , so we ... We gave him a word of warning and sent him on his way . And when did you hear he was missing ? May 13th . His mother came to the station . No trace of Connor was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abducted by the IRA . And do you know the identity of those who abducted Connor ? No . Is there anything further you might be able to add , Mr Fenton ? I 'd like you to think carefully before you answer . I'm afraid not , no . A moment , Mr Fenton . I think Miss Roche has some questions . I want to play a recording relevant to the case . We had no prior knowledge of this . Miss Roche ... is this recording of legitimate concern to this hearing ? It is . It was given to me by someone involved in Connor's abduction . Proceed . My mother has identified this as Connor's voice . - TAPE : - ' Name ? ' Connor Roche . ' If you ever want to see your mother again , ' you're going to tell me who , when , ' where , how often and why . ' Am I clear ? ' Why did you do it ? ' They said they 'd get me shot if I didn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? ' Twice a week . ' What were their names ? ' Inspector Fenton . ' And DS Briggs . ' Where did you meet them ? ' They 'd pick me up in Belfast and we 'd drive . ' And ? ' If I didn't give them information , they said they 'd drop me ' where people would be waiting to give me a head job . ' Did they pay you ? - ' TEARFULLY : - I didn't do it for money . ' What did you do it for ? ' SOBBING ON TAPE ' Cos I was scared . ' They kept saying what would happen if I didn't help them . ' I didn't do it for money . ' I'm telling the truth . ' Can I go home now ? ' SNIFFLING ON TAPE ' Can I go home now ? ! ' Mr Fenton , isn't it true that Connor was working for you ? I didn't say any of those things to Connor . Is it true that Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect lives . So you used Connor to gather that information ? We met him from time to time , in the same way we met many people . How many times did you meet him ? Perhaps half a dozen . I can't remember exactly . And you paid him ? Small amounts . Not very much . So what are we talking about ? Five or ten pounds ? More ? I think it was mostly about ? 10 . He just wanted to talk as much as anything . We were like ... .. friends . Connor said he was forced to supply information . No-one threatened him or said that he was going to be shot . So why do think he said those things ? He was frightened . He was just telling them what they wanted to hear . Mr Fenton , you were aware of Connor's age ? Look , I don't think you understand what we were having to deal with . - I understand that you were dealing with a child . - Miss Roche ... Please let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren't there , if you hadn't lived through it ... you can't understand what it was like . Things were falling apart . When you reported for duty , you never knew what you might be having to deal with . Police officers were handed caseloads of 200 , 250 murders . Working on them for a couple of months before they themselves were murdered . We were in a war . Things happened that ... .. that shouldn't happen . I want to say that I regret ... .. deeply what happened . I'm very sorry . Thank you for that . But you were aware of the fate of so-called informers , weren't you ? Yes . Did he supply you with any information you considered useful ? No . So a boy lost his life supplying meaningless information in exchange for petty cash ? No further questions . I didn't kill Connor . I'm not the person who killed him . Thank you , Mr Fenton . There will be a five minute recess . Did you know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't you say ? Honestly ? Because I couldn't be sure who you might tell . MAN RETCHING AND COUGHING TOILET FLUSHES - TANNOY : - ' Michael Madden to the Commission Chamber , please . ' It wasn't your fault . That's what happens when you don't stick to the script . We've had enough surprises for one day , so just keep it nice and simple . The commission calls Michael Madden . Would you please state your name and your connection to the case ? My name's Michael Madden . Mr Madden ? My name is Michael Madden . I joined the IRA when I was 17 . Made me feel big . But I wasn't big . I was an idiot . A message boy . In May 1992 ... I drove Connor and two volunteers to a farm across the border , in County Monaghan . Connor was dragged into the house and tied to a chair . And one of the men began to beat him . Badly . HE GASPS HE SOBS Phone calls were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape of him admitting what he 'd done . He was told after he 'd made the tape he 'd make a press statement . And then it would all be over . A couple of hours later , another man arrived from Belfast . When he saw the state that Connor was in , there was a real bust-up with the interrogator , who was shouting we were all soft in Belfast and too interested in looking good to get our hands dirty . Connor was to be kept for a couple of days until he mended up and could go back for the press conference . But some time around dawn , he escaped . The commander was screaming at us to find him . I was supposed to be keeping watch so I panicked . I ran into the woods . But Connor jumped me . He was wild . Kicking and punching . He was strong . He got on top of me . Pinning me down . But then ... .. there was a shot . Connor stopped struggling . He collapsed on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wasn't meant to happen . The two senior men were standing there ... .. and one had a gun . Michael ... tell us now who killed Connor . Francis Gilroy killed Connor . Please remain calm . Order , please . Order in the chamber . Order ! Call Francis Gilroy . HE MOUTHS The commission calls Francis Gilroy . PHONE RINGS Anna , how did it go ? Right . He actually named Francis ? I'll call you back . Frankie ! REPORTERS CLAMOUR Listen carefully . You've got to get out of the house . Get Alan to take you ... ' No , stop . We're not in the house , Dad . We're at the hospital . - ' The baby came early . ' - What ? - ' I've had the baby . ' - Where are you ? ' The Ulster Hospital . ' That's good . That's very good . Don't move from there . ' Relax , Dad . I'm not moving . ' OK . OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot him ? But you did order his abduction ? And you know who did shoot him ? But you won't say who . Well , whoever pulled the trigger , Roche had it coming . It was a war . Pull yourself together . Move on . Christine wants me to look at seating plans . DOOR OPENS And there's someone here to talk to you . Francis . You know why I'm here . You're here because you think this is your moment . I'm here to rescue your politically embarrassing situation . And because you think I won't tell Stanfield - it was you shot Roche . - That'll hardly save you . - Might save the party . - It's too late now . Oh . So , what's it to be ? Back to all-out war ? Let's just say we'll put a little more backbone into the struggle . Backbone ? ! Like shooting 15-year-old boys ? He was an informer . Whereas you're not , Francis . It's not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want Madden left out of it . Always the hero , Francis . Madden wasn't to know . Useless prick couldn't even get a simple confession right . It was only luck he named you and not me . Yeah , lucky , that ( ! ) I can make this difficult for you . Let him go . You go quietly , I'll see to it Madden goes unharmed . Your statement's been written . ' Yes ? ' Have you got him ? ' We got him . ' Well done . Now let him go . Can I ask why ? ' Because I say so . ' Is that understood ? ' Understood . ' Satisfied ? Be ready in an hour . He's beautiful . Tom . Hmm . Your grandfather's name . How was it today ? Gilroy ? I don't think Maria and her family got what they wanted . You called Gilroy after all ? I knew you 'd help . Would you like to hold him ? PHONE RINGS Oh , sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congratulations ! Becky told me the good news , Grandad . You don't think I had anything to do with Madden's performance ? Not I . Others are less sure . So , what now ? Despite today's catastrophe , amazingly , the feeling is it was a minor setback . Or a minor triumph . Oh , Henry . You get to call Gilroy . He'll resign , they'll replace him with someone less able and more belligerent . All because the Roches had to have the truth . - The truth is Gilroy is guilty . - Gilroy is not guilty . - I pleaded with you not to call him . - Why would Madden lie ? Thought he was telling the truth . - What ? - Who was it convinced the Roches that Gilroy shot Connor ? Tried to blackmail you , forced Madden to take the rap . Rafferty isn't protecting Gilroy , he's protecting himself . He'll be bossing it from here on in . New Sinn Fein minister . I've already told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of this . No , you're not washing your hands of this one , Henry . All sides are agreed . It was entirely my fault for letting Rafferty lead me by the nose . Stanfield is still the best man for the job . PM , pathological optimist , wants you to put this all behind you . I wouldn't disappoint her a second time . Following the serious revelations concerning a member of the power-sharing executive , both the Taoiseach and I are here tonight to reaffirm our commitment to the Truth Commission . And to offer our thanks to Henry Stanfield who hasn't shrunk from his task in doing what is necessary , however painful or politically challenging , in offering the truth to a community which has too long waited for answers . For those who have inflicted pain , for those who have endured pain , the truth can , and will , lead to healing , and a lasting peace . Thank you . APPLAUSE CAR HORN BEEPING No , wait . Mr Stanfield , do you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to say to me ? EXPLOSION From now on , you might think twice about digging up a past that you don't understand and that doesn't concern you . Like Gilroy ? Unfortunately , Francis had to be got rid of so we got you to do it for us . Nothing personal , you understand . I'll not give up ! ' In the light of recent accusations made before the Truth Commission , ' it's with a heavy heart that ' I have decided to stand down from my position as Minister ' in a government which I fought long and hard to bring into being . ' This has been an extremely difficult decision . ' And though I completely reject the accusations made , ' the credibility of our party is , and always has been , paramount . ' So I stand aside , confident that those who replace me ' will not waver in the struggle for a united Ireland , ' without which , this country can never fully be at peace . - ' REPORTER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilroy ? ' ' Recent weeks have shown that there are those with the courage and common humanity to face the consequence of their actions . ' The bombing of the Commission has shown that there are those ' who feel threatened by that courage ' and will do all in their power to suppress the truth . ' But the Commission will continue its pursuit of the truth , ' however inconvenient , not because we want to dwell in the past , ' but so that our children and grandchildren ' will be free of the past . ' Thank you . '

And your first act on entering was to order her to take off a valuable diamond ring she was wearing . And when her knuckles proved too swollen for her to remove it , you threatened to rip it off . Having thus reduced her to a state of quivering terror , she was then struck violently across the head and locked unconscious in her bathroom .

But , I mean , I can't go every day because of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiver a week and I make it do . Well , I mean , I pay one club one week , and then when I've paid that , it's my turn to buy something for myself , then it's Jenny's turn , then my turn . Mmh . Really , then , you live , or should I say exist on ? 5 a week . Yeah , that's right . Do you know , people say to me , "" Joy , I don't know how you do it . "" And do you know , the only little luxury I have is if a fella gives me a couple of quid . "" If a fella gives me a couple of quid . "" I see . Yeah . And that , to me , is marvellous . Mrs Steadman ... I must ask you at this stage in the proceedings whether in fact you have ever committed an indiscretion . Well ...

I love to dress up . - Mmh But don't you think , Mr Pinker , that love is the most important thing ? - No , I mean , don't you , really ? - Well , I ... Love and happiness is the most important thing . If you haven't got love , well , what have you got ? Nothing . I mean , money isn't really important . I mean , it's important to me at the moment , but that's only cos I can't have Dave , you see ? You know , I like to dress up and make myself look nice . Does your wife like to look nice and dress herself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with my mother . Oh . You're a bachelor , then . Yes . Yes . ( Beryl ) Hello . Good afternoon .

Now , he 'd love it , but he's scared stiff . - You can see that . - You 'd love it , wouldn't you , blossom ? ( Joy ) Shut up , Beryl ! ( Beryl ) See , I told you . ( Beryl ) Oh , look at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet he's got some muscles somewhere . ( Beryl ) And I wouldn't half like to get my hands on ' em . ( Joy ) Oh , Beryl , look at that girl . Isn't she pretty ? Why is it all these girls look so soft and I look so hard ? I never used to . Oh , leave off . Here , look at that one . He's the type would murder you first and hang you in a cupboard before he 'd have a thing to do with you . ( Joy ) You think he would ? ( Beryl ) Look at his eyes . You can tell . ( Joy ) He is a bit funny . ( Beryl ) Look at this one . ( Joy ) He looks as though he's got a bit of money to me . ( Beryl ) You're soft . Do you know that ?

That's before he's even touched me , mind you . You know , accidental , like . He might brush my arm or something like that . - Then I've had it .

He gets up in the middle of the night and gets in my bed . He keeps wetting the bed . I wake up in the middle of the night and I feel a great warm river flowing towards me . It's all them bottles , you know ? He shouldn't really still be on bottles . He's ... He's nearly three , isn't he ? Yeah . But , I mean , you wouldn't like it if you was thirsty and you couldn't have a drink , would you ? Anyway , it's a comfort to him . - Let him be happy while he's young . - Yeah . It's bleeding horrible when you're grown up . Don't say that , Dave . I mean ... we've had some happy times , haven't we ? Yeah . It was worth it to me , being alive just for them six months .

If you're coming here to see me and having drinks with fellas and ... running about in their cars , I just would rather not see you at all . That's all . Because I feel foolish . I feel foolish sitting here talking to you . And ... Do you see ? Don't you want me to come and see you anymore , then ? You know the trouble with you , Dave , don%you ? You listen to other people . You mustn't take notice of everything anybody says to you . It's just I , I ... For months I work out how it's gon na be when you come , how great it's gon na be .

The first time I came , he was sitting out in the grounds . And as he saw me , he started to cry his eyes out . That started me off . Then we were both crying our eyes out . He has to stay in for a while , Dave , he's doing a painting job . He won't be out till it's finished . It's government , secret job . Why's he wearing those funny clothes ? Oh , it's just a uniform so the spies don't get him . - ( Joy ) It's a job to know what to say . - Oh , dear ! The court's taken my home away . How can I afford to pay ? 7 a month on ? 5 a week ?

But they make laws so they can't get nicked . Not like us . We're the only people who get nicked when we do anything . Screws are the same as cozzers . If I 'd had a tenner a week to give a screw , I could've had a bottle of whisky every week . The only thing you can't get in there is a broad cos it's too big . That's all . Everybody's bent , Joy . It's like this flat . We had to give a few quid to get this flat . Plenty of people on the housing list can't get a flat cos they've got no money .

If you're gon na expose your breasts in a photograph , you see , you've either got to see both of them or none of them . - Really ? - Yeah . None of this business . You can't have one out and one in . You either have them both out or none . - Why's that ? - I don't know . ( MrJacks ) I like the patter . "" Man is for woman made and a woman made for man .

What do you reckon ? Mmh . It's quite nice . Yeah . How would you like to have a bit of wood , anyway ? ( Laughs ) Oh , I think she's repulsive . Look at that face . ( MrJacks ) Out the way . Out the way . ( MrJacks ) That's the one . ( Joy ) Oh , no , she hasn't got much . ( Joy ) I mean , I would've thought you liked them with , erm , you know ... ( MrJacks ) Well , yeah , I do . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MrJacks ) It's a landmark in the dark . - ( JoyLaughs ) ( Joy ) What do you like about her , then ? ( MrJacks ) Well , she looks in need of it , you see ? Oh ! Oh , you are cheeky , aren't you ? ( Joylaughs ) You know , what I 'd really like is a nice flat in Chelsea . Have you got any ? Have I got any ? Well , I might be able to put you onto one . Ooh , pardon . I might . Yeah , well , it sounds a bit more classy than this . Sounds a bit poxy , a flat in Wandsworth , doesn't it ? - Where have you been , Joy ? - I went to pay the rent . - You went to pay the rent ? - That's what I said . - You've been four hours paying the rent ! - Don't do that ! Don't start all that ! Now , don't start all that . Has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Eh ? I haven't seen one . What do you mean , has he got a couch ? You know what I mean ! Where's my tools ? - I haven't seen your tools ! - I want ' em ! - Now , don't you start ! Don't ! - Sit down ! I want my tools ! Don't start that with me . I've had just about enough of you . You're always having a go at me ! I come in this house , I do everything I can . I'm not your slave ! I'm not your ... - ( Screams ) - Now get ! Now get down there ! - You gon na get down there ? - Yes , I am ! I am ! Don't touch me ! - Get down there , then ! - ( Sobs ) - Let me go ! Don't hit me again , please ! - Let you go ? ( Sobs ) ( Tom ) Look , I'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! - Don't go running to your old woman . - Do you know what you've done ? - What have I done ? - You've hit me . You've hit me and ... - Look , I didn't mean to hit you . - You've hit me and I might be pregnant . - That's it . That's the finish . - I told you never to lend ' em , Joy . ( Joy ) ' You see , he won't go . He won't leave me . ' And I can't get rid of him unless he gets nicked . ' If only I had a car , I 'd drive off and find a place ' where there are only men and a few glamour girls ' and flashy cars and big hotels . ' But then I 'd muck myself up talking . ' Cos I always get ballsed up talking to the upper classes . ' Whoever heard of girls like me making it ? ' How can I go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same anymore . ' Oh , I can't stick this sort of security . ' I can't abear the thought of all these women doing the same things , ' you know , mopping down their steps , doing their ironing , ' changing their babies , doing their shopping . ' Then there's another side of life where the husband and wife are very happy . ' They don't have to dabble in what it's like with other people . ' If I leave Tom , I 'd be frightened . ' Cos I'm so frightened of being on my own . ' ( Joy ) Can I have a cup of tea , please ? ( Menchat ) ( Joy ) ' I suppose my life's over . ' Well , you only get one chance . ' I got a great pain in my heart yesterday . ' I really wanted to gas myself . ' I've never felt that desperate before . ' Then again , you read all this stuff in the papers . ' You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locked up , and all the rest . ' Well , I don't want my little Jonny , I don't want him to be a result of that . ' You know , the result of a broken home . Cos that would be terrible . ' And that's why I'm trying . That's why ... ' If I could find a bloke tomorrow ' who loved Jonny as much as he loved me ... ' ... well , I 'd go with him like a shot . ' Cos all you need is a man ' and a baby ... ' ... and a couple of nice rooms to live in . ' When you think of it , that's all it comes down to . ' ( TV ) ' ... but generally dry . There could be the odd showers ... ' Where's Jonny ? I don't know . I thought he was with you . ( Joy ) I told you I wasn't taking him with me . Well , I ain't your baby minder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you seen Jenny anywhere ' ? No , I haven't , love . I've had her in for an hour , give her tea and everything . - ( Joy ) Oh . - Don't know where he can be . It's half past seven , nearly , you know ? Shh , love ! He might be down the waste ground down there . There's a load of kids playing . Jonny ! Oh , God . Jonny , are you ' m there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you in there ? ( @knocks_on_door ) Jonny ' ? Oh , no . Jonny ! ( Sighs ) Jenny , are you over there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you ' m there ' ? Jonny ! 0h , my God ! ( Sob ) Oh . Jonny . Jonny . ! Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , my baby ! Oh , my baby ! Oh ! Mummy thought , I thought I 'd lost you for ever and ever and ever . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? - Yeah , we'll go now . ( Sighs ) That's difficult . I don't know cos I dream about it a lot , but I really don't know , if it came to it , I suppose it's all big dreams , really . But if anything happened to little Jonny , I suppose I 'd become a brass . Oh , is there any perfect life ? I don't think there is , really . People go on about how happy they are and what they got and what a lovely home they've got and they've got a new telly and they've got new fitted carpet in the lounge . And I sit there and I think ... And I go on about it myself . I'm always saying , "" Oh , I want this and I want that . "" But when you come down to it , I don't think there is a perfect life , really . You just got ta make do with what you've got and be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even talk about it . I always think of Dave . Cos he ... he brought out something that was inside me that I never knew was there . I ... You know , he was marvellous . I think about him all the time . If I ... If I listen to a record or something . It just ... You know , I just can't imagine he's not here with me , cos it was so marvellous . And it's terrible if you love someone . Why should they be taken away from you ? But I just think of the time when we're gon na be together again . And I hope it's not too long . Cos he was so different to Tom . He was soft and warm and ... It was ... It was fantastic . With Tom , he just , he's insensitive . He doesn't ... He never asks me if I'm all right or ... You know , he thinks that money is everything . But with Dave , it was fantastic .

Agent Douglas will be participating in the party operation this evening . The mission of this task force is to capture and incarcerate this man , Reginald Bailey : street name G . According to our sources , he is responsible for the recent surge of violence in Compton . Hopefully , he will lead us to this man , Tito Costa , under-boss to older brother Emile Costa . There are no images available of Emile Costa .

A few months ago , Dickie Marshall stepped in shit , and we cut him some slack .

Don't you want to save yourself ? - Where was George when Simon died ? - In the forest , working . He came back with a load of shingles and saw what had happened . - Where's the body ? - Buried .

She said she came down the river , from the west . Lots of Scots out there . Here's a sweet idea , why not bring Annie ? - She 'd brighten up any party . - I'm sure she would . Oh , Mullen . We're pretty much free to do as we wish out here . I'm going to the party , with or without you . Should be fun . ( drunkenlaughter ) ( @music_playing ) Well ...

This is William Sellor . I told you about him . He has some dresses he wants you to sew . Costumes . For a play based on an opera . Are you sure she can do this ? I can't afford to have it fail . It took two weeks to get the cloth . Ruth : She's an artist . Look at her work . Here . Yes , it's real nice . It is outstanding . - But ... - But what ? I've done a few sketches ... to inspire you . Here are the measurements for Lucia . Both dresses are for her . Are you familiar with the story of Lucia ? - No . - It's a wonderful story ... about a young girl named Lucia . She falls madly in love with a young man . Woman : Hello ! Hey . It's the Treeces . Welcome . Simon : Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if you folks would come over Sunday next . We haven't had a chance to welcome you , Mrs . Herron . We don't have time for parties . - Don't mind him , Mrs . Treece . - Hope you'll perform for us . With pleasure . We miss seeing you at the church . Well , I've been anxious to finish the house . Not working on Sundays , I hope . - Would you like some tea ? - No , thank you . We're on our way to the fort , actually . Simon , we'll be picking up some supplies before the weather changes , back in a couple of days . Is there anything you need ? No . It must be very awkward here for you , alone with these two young men . No , we manage very well . You have a lot of work to do before the snow flies . Well , now , here's something I haven't seen before . A fireplace open on both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll heat four rooms . Mr . Treece : Nothing but a fire hazard . You're sleeping out here ? You must be freezing . You're welcome to sleep at our place , George . Well , it's not so bad . I've built a shelter . I've got that bear rug you gave me . You're building too close to the creek . This whole area floods in the spring . Hup ! We didn't need his help , or anyone else's . He's hoping we'll fail so he can take it over . Or he'll marry his daughter off to George . You 'd be daft enough to do it , huh ? - You borrowed the house , Simon . - I paid him in furs . He isn't so smart . Lots of places have fireplaces , open like this . Every house in Orkney . Annie : That Jenny does have her eye on you , George . Pure and simple . Nothing's pure , and never simple . ( peoplechatter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night . Sir ? Annie gave me this to mail . I never mailed anything . So I thought I should give it to you . Thank you , Ruth . I'll take care of it . Annie's voice : "" Dear Sadie , I'm in terrible trouble .

Mullen , the fort headquarters , will find you a place to stay . Yours affectionately , Annie . "" It says nothing . It says she's keeping a great deal to herself . I'll post the letter .

I thank God every night that you're here . You've been such a blessing . - ( Anniesighs ) - I 'd better go back and make supper . Annie ... if you were my wife ... I would worship you . Mullen's voice : A month has passed , and no light has been shed on the young woman's true identity , nor on the location of her homestead . Her youth and open demeanor invite sympathy . But in my experience , judging a woman from her parents is always a mistake . I think I 'd better give this to you . Thank you . Look at this . "" Sadie Johnson ... deceased .

Well , I was raised by my father's sister , a schoolteacher . Simon was not so lucky . He was raised by my mother's cousin , a woodsman . I can sing a tune ... but you might not like it much .

I wouldn't think of traveling so late . - I'm staying . - Afraid of the wolves , Reverend ? God will protect you . I hope you'll come back soon , Mrs . Herron . Maybe I can't read or write ... but I can do a day's work , - and not whine about it . - We're going , Simon . I just wanted to thank you for the best meal I've ever had , and for your hospitality . - God bless you all . - He 'd be dead if it weren't for me . - 1 00 times over . - We're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bony ass . You saw how he was . Oh don't mind him , George . I made a raisin pie . Sit down . Thank you . Jenny made the custard , George . Simon , I'm falling ! You think I'm stupid ?

Let's get it nice and warm in here first . Take everything off now . Just sit down and -- I'll undress for you . You'll like it . I'll take off everything . Just sit there . George will be here soon . Be very quiet , and go to bed . George : Annie ! Annie ! Annie ! Are you all right ? - Geor -- - Annie ! God damn you . - Get the hell away from here . - Annie ! Annie , just say something . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell him , honey ... how much you love your husband . I'm fine , George . I'm fine . No ... I'm coming inside . Annie : No , don't ! Don't ! - Annie . - Go away , George . - Annie , please . - Go now . Please , go . ( Simongroans ) George : Christ . Mullen : Thank you , Donnely . I've had a response from my inquiries . - A Reverend McBain . - Have they found George ? He says he arranged the marriage between you and Mr . Herron . Seems to know a great deal . He's very concerned about you . And ... he says that this has been a horrible mistake . Why did you come here ? Have you ever looked into a dead man's eyes ? No , not a dead man's . A dead child's . My daughter ... just a few days old . - I'm sorry . - I blame myself . But that doesn't make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forever . Heeyah ! Annie , do you remember me ? Reverend McBain , of course . Poor wee child . We've gone over every idea . Then we got word you were here . - Have you seen George ? - He's at the Treeces ' . He's distraught and confused ... as I'm sure you are . Annie ... George told us what happened . I think not , Reverend . I think not . What have you got on , there ? I'm going to marry the devil . Tell George not to lie unless he's absolutely certain the truth will never be discovered . Aye , we'll make some arrangements , sir . Her mother was a Catholic , but her father was a Scot . Make him go away , Mr . Mullen ! Nobody's accusing her of anything . You weren't there , Reverend ! You don't know ! Will you just listen to me ? Calm down , Reverend . This is going nowhere . - ( Anniehums ) - Donnely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He's a member of my congregation . - He swore it is truthful . - Either she's mad ... Am I wicked or insane ? Annie : George ! He's finally asleep . Annie ... it's all right . Let's get inside . Take me away . We could start over - - our own place , our own family . Simon : God damn you . No , don't ! No ! - Annie : George ! - I should do the same to you ! Annie : He's sick from the drink . He's fallen asleep . He's sorry . I'm sure he'll apologize . He can apologize to Satan , for all I care . What if the fire goes out ? He'll freeze . Mr . Treece : How are you doing there ? George : I'll talk . Jesus ! Simon , what are you doing ? ! - Get off my land ! - What do you think you're doing ? ! - I'm here to help ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We can't stay here . She won't last the winter . Simon : Walk away ! We need help ! Can't you see that ? You want to lose this place ? It'll happen . George , Mrs . Herron , you're all right ? Simon : Get away from us ! - Leave us alone ! - You're not thinking , son . Hey ! Now you have one last chance to make this right . You get on that horse and we get to work . And you stay the hell away from her . Or you leave here alone ... and you don't ever come back . George . Annie's voice : "" Oh Sadie , I know there's no possibility of me mailing this letter , but still I must talk to you . Thank goodness Simon can not read . I fear that the worst has happened .

Annie's voice : What should we do ? What should we do ? When did it happen ? Yesterday ? You got in a fight ? It was an accident ? Don't you worry . Everything will be all right . - A tree fell on him . - Poor Simon . He was my husband , but I never really knew him . No one did . He worked hard . Aye . Annie's voice : I can not deny it , Sadie , I felt a tremendous sense of relief when I saw he was dead . I wanted to put everything about him behind me , as though he had never happened ... as though it was George who had come for me and brought me here . My prayers had been answered . God forgive me . Of course God forgives you . It was an accident . Close your eyes . God will tell us what to do . Our Father Who art in Heaven , hallow be Thy name ; Thy kingdom come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treeces . - And the reverend . - Not tonight . I've covered the body . It's safe enough . Tomorrow . Get in there quickly before it gets cold . It's so peaceful here . Aye . I had a wee nap while you were outside . Everything will be all right . I wanted you from the first moment I saw you . Annie . My apologies . I didn't mean to frighten you . I was worried about you . I spoke to Mr . Treece . - Annie : Oh . - Aye . Yes , good of you to come . Reverend . Welcome . George . - Where is Simon ? - He's gone ... to the fort . We needed a new axe . Mr . Treece was very upset . He told me Simon shot at him . Not at him . In the air . I didn't think it was him at first . Yes , Simon - - the firing and all , - he was upset . - Aye . I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- - He understands he was wrong . - He's sorry . - I'm sure . I don't want to make matters worse , but- when will he be back ? - We'll tell him you came over . We are all very worried about you . Do you not think it 'd be wise to find yourself a place to stay until spring ? We're doing fine , Reverend . - Truly . - Aye . We'll build it better this time . In the meantime ... we'll manage . - Would you like some tea ? - No , thank you . I can see you're busy . George . Why did you lie to him ? Why did you lie to the reverend ? To give us time together ... now . But why not just tell him what happened ? Annie ... I want to be with you ... alone with you ... now . To love you . But we have to give Simon a proper funeral at the church . No . - I'll bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God . It's what he 'd want . - Where are you going ? - To check the trapline . Mullen's voice : January 6th : I have determined to journey to the Herron homestead to investigate for myself . Mr . Mullen . I'll be gone by the time you're back . This country is testing me . I must confess it got the better of me . You were right to send me back , I suppose . You can send me some correspondence on the girl . I 'd be interested to know what you discover . There you go . Good luck . Mullen's voice : The decision whether to charge Mrs . Herron weighs heavily upon me . The difference between Mrs . Herron's account and that brought by Reverend McBain is so striking as to demand further inquiry . I've sent word of my desire to examine the body and to interview all involved . ( gunshot ) George : God damn it ! - Piece of shit ! - Annie : What happened ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow to get a shovel so we can bury him . - You were gone a long time . - Aye . I needed time ... to think . - About what ? - About what to do now . I don't know much about farming . Simon was the one who could do all that . I was brought up in a town ... in a big house , with help . I don't think I can do this now . You won't be alone . I'll be here . Our farm will be a proper farm . We'll have chickens and geese and cows ... - and babies . - Annie . I -- I don't even care if we can have this now . What are you thinking ? I have nowhere else to go . It's not right . What we're doing , it's not right . I know . We should have waited . All right ... but I want you now . I can't help it . I don't want to face anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will become of us ? Henry Mullen . I'm looking for George Herron . Mr . Treece : He's not here . He's gone to visit his aunt . I've sent word with Reverend McBain . They'll be coming within the week . - Never mentioned it . - I need to speak with him . - Take a statement . - Not to worry . You can stay with us . He'll be back within a few days . It wasn't right , her being there with those two laddies . Simon was mainly stupid , very different from George . George is a sweet laddy . We feel so badly for him . He's hardly said a word since the accident . When they first arrived , George came to the church every Sunday . Then she arrived . The reverend said she was raised by our church , but -- - We had them for supper . - They left in the middle of dinner . - Jenny : George didn't want to go . - Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon ran him off with a gun . - A gun ? - Aye . I ... told Reverend McBain . I'll take them straightaway and let her try them on . She will be so pleased . I have more work if you have time . I have nothing but time , sir . Yes . Yes , this is absurd ... - you in here . - Oh , I like it . Yes , well ... freedom has little to do with one's physical surroundings . Allow me . I will be back . Mullen's voice : The spareness and isolation of the place oppressed me . Life here would be barely supportable under the most favorable conditions . There was a grave , as Mrs . Herron had said . But it was empty ... the surrounding soil soaked in blood . Someone had been here recently , to judge by the fire still smoldering in the ruined fireplace . Annie's voice : I heard his skull crack . ( gunshot ) ( animalwhining ) What are you doing here ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Henry Mullen . George Herron . I'm here to examine the body of the deceased ... your brother . It was an accident . There seems to be some question of that . Put that gun down . You told the Treeces you were visiting your aunt . I was . I am ... but I decided to come here first . - To check the trapline . - I saw the body , George . In the fireplace . Wolves dug him up . It was ... gruesome . Some parts were dragged into the bush ... chewed to the bone . So I gathered up everything I could find ... - and I burnt it . - In the fireplace ? I couldn't think of what else to do . - How old are you ? - I'm 1 7 , sir . 1 7 ... I know your story , from both the reverend and Mr . Treece . Now I think you should tell me in your own words . There's not much to tell . My brother had an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree fell on him . And Annie ... his wife , well , it undid her , I guess . - She took off . - Fond of her ? Aye . We get along all right . We both like books and music . And your brother ? Did you get along with him ? Simon and I didn't have much in common . But he worked hard . He wanted to make a better life for himself , for us . - And I appreciated that . - I see . What are you doing ? I'm taking your brother's remains with me . - You're taking them ? - Yes , as evidence . They'll be returned to you if you wish , for burial . - Or we can bury them for you . - No , I'll bury him . Very well . Are you going to continue homesteading ? It's all I have . Mr . Treece says he'll help me plant in the spring . They've been very kind to me . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become of Annie , sir ? If the evidence supports her claims , we'll charge her ... and she'll go to trial . - So she can hang ? - If she's found guilty , yes . And if she is found guilty , you'll be considered just as guilty for withholding evidence . You understand this ? You're under investigation as well . Aye . But she's not guilty , Mr . Mullen . I can say that before God , my maker . I'll need a sworn statement to that effect . - Aye , sir . - Do you like hunting ? I like to live , sir . My brother taught me that much . Mullen's voice : My journey has both raised and answered questions . That crushed skull is damning evidence . But George Herron is adamant ... that it was accident . I now had a picture of her life there - - a hard life with a hard man . Hard enough to drive a woman to madness ? Or murder ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mind to charge her and let the jury decide the matter . - Mr . Mullen is back . - Yes . He's very tired . He slept under the stars last night . - Did he speak to George ? - He doesn't report to me . - I must talk to him . - ( Ruthchuckles ) He doesn't report to you either . Hand me your linens . And your rags ? - Ah , Mr . Sellor . - Sorry . I heard you were back . - Yes . Is there a problem ? - Not exactly . Mrs . Herron asked me to mail this , but the postmaster said her last letter to Sadie Johnson was returned , marked "" deceased . "" I find it peculiar that she hadn't been told . I thought it best . She's been under considerable duress -- I tell you what , leave it with me . I would never forgive myself if I did her any harm . She's done enough harm to herself , I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ? - Full rehearsal this evening . - Congratulations . - I look forward to seeing it . - Thank you . - Mr . Sellor ? - Yes ? Don't mention anything to Mrs . Herron . Please . Will you have your supper now , sir ? Yes , I'll be dining in here this evening . The girl would like to have a word with you . I'll speak with her tomorrow . - Sir -- - Thank you , Ruth . Annie's voice : Dear Sadie , why have you not answered my letters ? I can only think you have not received them . Hell is truth . Seen too late . He was no longer a boy . The child was gone in him . ( animalgrowls ) Get away from there ! Go ! Go ! Go ! You don't scare me ! The cut had been made by an axe . Deep and gruesome , cutting through bone and right through the heart of him . Whatever had happened out there , Sadie , had ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all because of me . I had set them against each other . I told you I would bury him . You say it was an accident . - Just like you said . - Why didn't you leave him alone ? Help me . ( Georgescreams ) ( crack ) George : I killed him . I watched him spout his last bloody breath . And there was no sign . You wanted him dead , too . We're both guilty , I know that . But nobody need judge us . I did it for you . He was going to come back and have you , he said . Laughing at me . He was talking crazy about what he 'd do to you . So I picked up the axe ... and I flung it wildly . And he went down ... with one scream . Then he just looked at me . And that was it . It was much too easy . Much too easy . Aren't you coming to bed ? Maybe we both wanted it . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone . It was better when you didn't know the truth . Because every time I look at you , I remember pulling that bloody blade out of my brother's back . ( @horse_neighs ) Where are you going now ? The truth is chasing me , Annie . I can not sleep and I can not stay here . - I'm going to the fort . - It's both of us , - not just you . - If someone comes , just tell them the truth about what I did . I'll turn myself in . They don't need to know about us . Don't go ! I hope that I never see you again . Annie's voice : I waited for days , going slowly mad . I thought George had gone to the fort and that he would hang for a crime that was as much mine as his . Finally , I could bear it no longer . ( @breathing_heavily ) I know my part in this . But I did truly think that George loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has she been ? Mrs . Herron ? Not so well . Worried . And sick in the mornings . She is with child . It's quite apparent . She's having a baby . You can't hang her now , can you ? It's not up to me , Ruth . I think it is . I know it is . Annie's voice : I need you here , Sadie . I have an enormous favor to ask . Please send word immediately , or I really will go mad . Mr . Mullen . - I have something to tell you . - Yes , but first - - please , take a seat , Mrs . Herron . This has been returned . I'm so sorry . Have you come to some conclusions ? Not yet . It's more complicated than I anticipated . That's all I can say . I'll have Ruth bring you some tea . Mullen : "" In the matter of Mrs . Annie Herron -- In the matter of Mrs . Annie Herron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion of this office that there's insufficient evidence to warrant the laying of charges . for any criminal act .

Enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing- This is the beauty part : This man has debts- Sizable debts , Debts that must be collected before the public offering . Follow me , jonathan ? This man , his position is worthless to him . Cash is what he needs . Stock is potential . He could use it for a loan . He can not because of the nature of the debt-The nature of the people he owes this money too . He must repay these people , and quickly , Before his situation is discovered . You see ? This is where my partners and i come in . We have been offered a piece of his piece . How much ? $300,000 . We have two in hand . There's more on paper , but ... we've decided to open up our circle , bring in other men-Younger men , men with ambition . - Me ? - For one . Yeah , how much ? A piece of our piece . Not large . - Beginner stuff . - Yeah , how much ? Almost nothing- 20 . 20 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copper . Take a loan against it . That way it's only another 10 out of pocket . You-A man like you could always get his hands on 10 . Who are the other partners ? These deals are based on the silence of friends . The lesson of ivan boesky : "" What you don't know can't hurt others . "" I myself am acquainted with only three of the other partners . You're a man looking for opportunities . Not on a subway . Opportunity , by definition , is "" happenstantial . "" If you only seize what's obvious , you'll never be rich . Carpe diem , jonathan . If you don't , you'll hate yourself in the morning . - I have to think about it . - You'll find yourself checking the quotetron , Looking for duran , watching what should have been your future slipping away from you . - I have to think . - Balls is what's required here . What is required here is to be a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A check could be traced back to you . Yeah , of course . Tomorrow morning . I didn't get on the train that morning . And i never saw the man again on the 5:24 . I thought about him , though . About whether i had narrowly missed being conned , Or maybe i had turned my back On the biggest opportunity of my life . In the months that followed i couldn't stop thinking About why the man had chosen me . Did i look so vulnerable , Or did i have a weakness in my character So evident that it attracted the man to me ? Even now , i can not say . He was right about one thing though-Duran pharmaceuticals did go public , And i did check the quotetron for it-Every single week . By the end of the year It was up 20 points . About a year later , I caught a later train than usual . Broad street , wall street . Change after the number-2 . Mind if i take the paper ? Croft integrals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Smith barney ? Goldman sachs ? You trade , yes ? Hi , it's fern . I'm here ... i know . Yeah , well , i'm on my way . No , i'm taking the subway . What ?

Jake , we don't listen to each other . - We're not with each other . - Belinda . Huh ? I was listening to everything you said . I heard . The mayor , i'm listening . I'm with you . Belinda ?

Something bad just happened . Hey . "" Daily news , "" two coffees , regular , please . I was living in newly-Married comfort , Over on atlantic avenue in brooklyn . Every day my wife and i would step out of our apartment house together And make our way down to the a train At the hoyt-Schermerhorn station . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head north into manhattan . This particular day was our three-Month anniversary . As a trader of municipal bonds , I saw this date in terms of a quarterly report . Thing were better than expected . Two coffees and a "" daily news . "" Danny bernardo - Now i know i've told you about him before . He's the one who's always getting into trouble . Holly calore just walks right up to him And gives him this sweet little peck on the cheek . It was the funniest thing , And the whole class just busts out laughing and cheering . Anyway , it was the most adorable thing . - It was like , his first kiss , you know ? - Uh-Huh . So sweet . It was a chance encounter , really-Which i was entirely uninvolved . So i told myself at the time , anyway . Although i couldn't help believing It was just some strange coincidence ... i couldn't help hoping that it wasn't . Coincidence ? Or was it fate ? Whichever - Our little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly nine months . Our relationship developed its own silent rules , Strictly obeyed . Expressions of greetings and farewell were unthinkable . No word ever passed between us , and no sign , Not even a shared glance or smile . But once our contact was established , It provided the means by which the rocking of the train Became our own sensuous rhythm . I began to think of my hand as possessing a powerful attraction , In the way that males of certain animal species Have natural adornments that females find irrisistible-Like the peacock's fan . At the same time , i understood what was happening between us Could not be duplicated , Even if i spent every available hour Clutching poles in full view of all the city's females . I realize conversation is a risk-But i'm ready-Ready to take the next step . Oh god , what would i possibly say to her ? Share my views on republican party politics ? What if she's a democrat ? Comment about the weather ? Too banal . "" I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right , let's spoil the mystery . We've had this thing ... going for a little bit of time now , you know ? And i think that maybe , you know , we should ... have a conversation , you know ? God forbid-Excuse me ? I'm sorry . I'm sorry , did you hear me ? Excuse me . That's out of the question ? What ? I'm sorry . Our first fight . I suddenly remembered ardrey's territorial imperative From my psychology class in college . I understood then that i was only potent and attractive In that small area around the pole . Outside of it , the electricity would fail . It was sweet . Was it really worth what i might be losing ? I guess i thought i 'd found something with her That i could not find in my own marriage . But i was wrong . So i left her ... for the f train . If we want to know what sex it is , they can tell us . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know ? - No , i definitely don't want to know the sex . - Come on . No , i want it to be a surprise . Coincidence , irony , fate , what have you-Thank god it's all behind me . Who was that ? Did you know her ? Honey , who was that ? - Who was that ? - I don't know . I don't know who that was . Miss ! Hey ! Miss . Don't do it ! Move back ! Move back ! Move back ! Miss ! Hey , hey ! Hey , someone ... anybody ? She's ... don't do it ! Don't jump !

Um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , is Dr . Beckham here ? I 'd like to just pop in before I go . He's only here in the morning and usually stops by after dinner . I just thought you should know about her tricks . Oh . We know all the tricks . That's why we don't have any doors . They know we 'd jog around the room all day if nobody could see us . It 'd be like the Rexie Olympics up in here . Okay . Call us if you need anything , and , um ... we'll see you soon , okay ? - Be good . - Okay . Not too good . Not perfect . Got it . I got it . Pearl usually gives the tour , but , obviously , she's not going anywhere . So , Luke is your guy . - Ellen , Luke . - We've met . Onward . This , as you can see , is a living room . We meet here twice a day for "" Bitch and Bawl . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Well , it's what I call group therapy . - And what's the deal with levels ? I prefer to think of them as draconian points earned for good behavior . Like when you were little and you had chores , if you had chores . This is the torture chamber , also known as the dining room . Chores , uh , which I never had because that would assume I had parents who gave a shit ... - So , you do chores to get points ? - Among other things , yes . And Lobo and the other nurses and counselors can give them or take them away at will . Amass enough points , level up . Earn extra privileges , like , you can go out of the house on your own . I'm actually currently deciding on where to go on my next outing . So far , I've eaten at nine of the places on Jonathan Gold's essential 100 list . Jonathan Gold is my muse . Raymond Chandler was your muse a few minutes ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep up with me . Onward . So , welcome to our new house member , Ellen . - Hi . - Hi , Ellen . Hello . So , how this works ... This is just an end of day check-in . The morning sessions are a little more focused . This is just to talk about struggles and our victories and ... any other issues you might be having here in the house . Let's start with Pearl . Struggle ... I got tubed today , and , uh ... you know , it hurts . Now , I feel all ... hot . I can't stop thinking about how many calories are in that drip . - They won't say . - Fifteen hundred . I looked it up . I was tubed a couple times . Ellen , we try not to crosstalk . We don't talk about numbers or weight or anything like that . - Sorry . - Fifteen hundred ? How are you feeling right now , Pearl ? It's okay . I don't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gon na be burning it off , especially when everybody's here watching you ? Do you know why you feel that way ? - Because I ... have an addiction ? - In a way , yes . When the exercise and the rituals kick in and ... the cyclical thoughts about weight take over , everything else goes away . And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric , like a drug addict or an alcoholic . It's not about "" thin enough , "" right ? There's no "" thin enough . "" It doesn't exist . What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wan na feel . And we give you a lot of rope here . It's scary , but only you can decide ... to see what's good , to be alive . - You understand ? - Kind of . - I'm trying . - Yeah , you are . Talk to me , brother . My victory was leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means I get to go to Guelaguetza , Oaxacan restaurant , number 26 on Mr . Gold's essential 100 . And affordable , which is also essential . Ballet companies don't pay you a fortune . That's great . Talk to me about your struggles . Don't know , really . I guess I'm obsessing about my injury and ... if I'll be able to perform when I get get out of here . - But I've got a goal . So , that's good . - You have a couple of goals . Eating Oaxacan and getting healthy so you can dance again . Damn straight . I've got goals coming out my wazoo . Ellen ? Struggle , um ... Coming here . I mean , accepting that I have to come here . So , maybe your victory is that you're here . Hmm ? Yeah , maybe . Did Luke explain about meals ? No . By the time we got to that , he was onto some musical thing . - ? Sugar blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar blues ? - ? Sugar blues ? - Luke . Eat what you want . If you have special food , like Kendra here does , that's fine . - We'll get it for you . - That's it ? No , you're definitely judged . When you eat , points magically appear . What he means is , if you're maintaining or moving towards your goal , you go up a level . - How you do it is up to you . - Really ? Yeah , but no one leaves the table at mealtime , and bathrooms are locked for 30 minutes after . And there's no point pretending to eat or throwing up into the plants or whatever . It smells , and it doesn't end up on the scale . Got it . - Thank you , Lobo . - De nada . - All right . Who wants to say grace ? - Oh , sorry . - Dear Jesus ... - Take us to church . Allah , Oprah , My Little Pony , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bodies what they need to grow strong and beautiful because every single person at this table deserves to live . - Mm . - Amen . Bon app ? tit . Oh , yeah . Oh , my God . This is so fucking good . Oh , my God . Pearl ? You freaked her out with the 1500 thing . I mean , it's not your fault ... - I didn't mean ... - Oh , no , no , no . It's not your fault . I mean , don't stress . - How many in-patients have you done ? - Four . Six . The rest of these guys , they have no idea . I mean , Pearl's not actually just upset about the tube . She might get kicked out . Seriously ? I mean , she looks pretty sick . No , Dr . Beck says that hospitals are for sick people . We're here to get over that shit . Ice cream's my favorite . - It comes up the easiest . - How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barf is clear and it doesn't burn anymore . Oh . I wish I could barf . I'm only good at the binging part . - You purge ? - I tried . It's not my thing . So , how do you get rid of it if you can't barf ? - It's gross . - Tell me . Your ponies wouldn't want you to cry . Hello Kitty wouldn't want you to cry . The unicorn on the stairs wouldn't want you to cry . Hey , there . - Settling in ? - Yeah . - Where's everyone else ? - May I ? Okay . Anna went to the movies . Points . Cool . I'm having your family come in for a group session tomorrow afternoon . It's standard when I see new patients . If it's productive , we'll do it from time to time . Okay . - Even my mom ? - Even Mom . Wow . I told her it takes me longer to drive in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kiddo . Glad you're here . I didn't mean it . I ... I mean , I didn't mean for my drawings to do what they did . - What ? - On Tumblr . I know Susan told you what happened , and ... it'll come up , I bet . Right . I was just doing what all my teachers told me to do . Draw what you know ? - Yeah . - I hear you . Just keep it for yourself , for now , okay ? Okay . Good night . Oh . Sweaty . I ran home from the movies . Don't tell anyone . Okay . - What movie did you see ? - Oh , um ... They were playing Shaun of the Dead at the New Beverly with Zombieland . - No way . - Yeah . Emma Stone's kinda fat . Don't you think ? Oh , no , I think she's just big-boned . She's , like , at least , a size six . - Anyway , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . I'm breaking 120 today , dolls . - Is that going up or down ? - Up . Eighty-nine when I came in . Eighty-nine ? How tall are you ? You're a beautiful unicorn . - You , cheer captain , come on . - All right . Let's do this . Megan's been gaining . She's flipping out . But , I mean , she wants to , I think , for her baby . - She ... She's pregnant ? - Oh , nobody said ? - Jesus , I didn't even think about ... - I know . That's why Luke calls her "" the unicorn . "" She gets her period once and gets pregnant off some guy she barely knows . I'm never having a baby . No way . Where are you ? That's probably Dad , right ? - Making some excuse . - Yeah , annoying . - I heard them fighting this morning . - Great . That's great . Oh , my God . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost . It's okay . Why ? Mom , it's okay , it's okay . My God . - No dad ? - I'm sorry , work . Well , he has to support his family ... and pay alimony , still , and the medical bills and ... Understood . Bet you didn't expect this much "" gynergy "" today . I do think this is a record number of mothers for one patient . Okay , I want everybody to understand nobody's on trial here . I just want to get a sense of the family . Well , until recently , Ellen lived with us . She moved in with her father 18 months ago . We thought it might be good for her to heal that relationship . He's shown little interest in who Ellen really is . He's only interested in who he wants her to be . Ellen is an artist . She's extremely bright and sensitive . She was never going to go into Chinese - or computers or what have you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants for you ? I don't know . I guess ... I think he just wants me to be able to make a living . - Exactly . Is that a crime ? - No crimes , remember ? The point is , Ellen's father never saw who she was . He left when she was very young ... Yeah , because you were sleeping with your best friend over there . - No , that's not why the marriage ended . - There's a better reason ? We are not here to defend our relationship . When are you going to come up with a different narrative , Susan ? - What narrative ? - What narrative ? - Susan ... - No , this is the truth . - Jack didn't wan na have sex . - Well , he likes it with me just fine . - Twice a week , like clockwork . - Oh , my God . Besides , he's not the one who abandoned her . We did not abandon Ellen . We moved to Phoenix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Because we 'd been dealing with Ellen's illness alone for years . I didn't abandon my daughter . I love her more than life . I just didn't know what to do . She's dying right in front of us . What's going on with you right now ? I'm sorry ... that I'm not a person anymore . I'm a problem . - And it's all my fault . - Fuck fault . Fault and blame have no place here . Only how you wan na live , moving forward . Who you wan na be . How about you , Kelly ? What do you think of all this ? Um ... I , uh ... I feel kind of angry , I guess . I just ... I just don't really ... Really get it . You know , just ... eat . I don't know . It's just like ... It's not her life that she's just missing out on . It's ... It's my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ... a sister . You know , I look at pictures of my prom and stuff , and ... and all I think of is , like , "" Oh , that's when ... Ellen was in the hospital , "" or ... "" That's when she fainted on the bus . "" All right . And all of my friends , they think that she's some kind of freak . - Like , a freak who killed a girl . - Because of the blog ? - Tumblr . - Yeah , and that's bad enough , but now , people wan na be like her and look like her and go through what she's going through . Nobody died because of Ellen's artwork , okay ? There's plenty of stuff out there for people to fetishize . But that certainly didn't help , to have notoriety for starving ... But that's what I'm saying . - Ellen has talent . - I didn't say she doesn't . But if you hadn't made her take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her voice . Ellen took it down herself after that young woman died because she knew it was the right thing to do . - You are so full of shit , Susan . - What ? Do you even hear what Judy is saying ? A young women died . - No , no , no . - Meet me in the car . I'm sorry , we just ... We just can't take you with us right now . - We're gon na miss our plane . - Okay , all right . - All right ? - Okay . Ellen ... be strong , okay ? Hey , I'm really sorry if I got you in any sort of trouble ... - Please , no , I'm sorry . I hate that ... - No , no , no , it's ... it's whatever . You can forget it . What a shit-show . You really need to get better so you never have to see those people ever again . If you die ... I will kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Dinner . - I'm staying up here . You don't have to eat , but the rule is that everyone has to sit down . Have you been thinking about baby names ? Not yet . I have a whole list of favorites that you can have . I was actually considering a new moniker . - What about Dean or Tex ? - When I get out of the first trimester . Do you want to get out of the first trimester ? - Jesus , Luke . - Stay out of this , Mia . This is between us rexies . She knows what I'm talking about . I don't know . I'm terrified . It just feels so ... out of control . But it's kind of a miracle , you know ? ' Cause I didn't think anything was working down there . So , maybe ... I'm supposed to have this baby . And I want to . I just want to think about something besides me for once . Amen , sister . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't wan na jinx it . - No , please . A shower would be so cute . - Yeah , no . All right , fine . Maybe . - If I get past 12 weeks . - Yay ! Well , we're gon na help you make it past . Every bite you take feeds the miracle . Pass the potatoes . - Oh , my God ... - Are you sure ? - I don't know . - Here they are . - Just don't talk . - Here they are . - Miracle potatoes . - Miracle , miracle potatoes . - I like that . - Pretty good . How about the newbie ? How you doin ' ? Finished . - What happened ? - She had family therapy today . - Oh . - Makes sense . Mm-hmm . Hey . I missed dinner . I found your barf stash . Keep this to yourself and I'll get you some laxatives . - I don't ... I don't use ... - Come on , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that thing that you do ? What thing ? Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger than , what , a silver dollar ? Deal . Cigarette for dinner . - That's not gon na get you points . - Not in the mood . Okay . And who in hell made you house den mother ? You walk around here like you've got it all figured out . Well , if you're so fixed and special , why don't you go back to New Jersey or London or wherever the fuck you're from ? I am going back , as soon as my BMI's closer to my age . But right now , I 'd rather try and help people than mope about feeling sorry for myself . You have no idea how I'm feeling . - I never said I did . - And what ? You wan na help people ? What are you , a doctor now ? - You feel pretty proud of yourself ? - Yeah , I am , actually . I'm moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scares you . But people actually go home sometimes and have a life , even people with fucked-up families . Yeah . There goes that fucking excuse again , huh ? Enter . Hey . - Hey . - Don't be all pleased with yourself . Wow . I never thought I 'd meet anyone more defensive than I am . And yet ... So , you've been here awhile . Six months . - Is that you ? - Hard to believe , I know . I didn't mean that ... Yeah , I can tell that it's you . Incredible . You know what it's like to be 19 and feel like you've already peaked ? Um , a relief . No . I loved it . I could push it and push it . And then I broke and went batshit , obviously . But my knee's getting better , and my company director says he'll have a place for me as soon as I get my act together , so ... - It's my drawing . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a year ago . That's why I acted like such a spaz when you first got here . - You're like my ... - You're muse ? Shut up . I just figured , somebody so talented , I had to be brilliantly charming to get you to like me . - Well , you overshot . - I'm aware . In my defense , though , I've been running on empty for so long that when I actually eat now , I get this crazy burst of energy . - That's why you're so weird . - I'm always weird . That's why I'm ... assertive . How do you do it ? Eat . I mean , I see you , and I just ... I get ... I get all panicky even thinking about it , like , the world is gon na fall apart . I feel that way . But you know , feel the fear and do it anyway . Yeah , but aren't you scared you won't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Be like one of those guys who has to be lifted out of his bed with a crane ? Yeah , but Dr . Beck says that's not gon na happen , so ... - Yeah , but he has to say that . - Well , he's pretty straight-up . Plus , I'm not gon na lie . I'm really fuckin ' hungry . Like , two years worth of hungry . Whenever I can't sleep , I draw food . Oh , yeah ? Like ... what ? - Do you know what a Goo Goo Cluster is ? - Oh , my God . Yeah , greatest candy bar ever . Peanuty , marshmallowy greatness . Oh , it's 240 calories there , 110 from fat . Whoa . Calorie Asperger's . - Maybe . - My last meal would be a whole box of ' em . Oh , yeah ? How would you eat them ? Show me . You wish . Um , right . Well , I 'd better ... Right , right , right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I be ? Good night . Epic . Step on . - Unless you wan na face the other way . - No , I'm good . I didn't sew rocks into my panties , if you're worried . I'm not . Step off . Wow , that's bad . You know what the body burns after there's no more fat ? Muscle . Organ tissue . Pretty soon , you're gon na be flopping around like a boneless fish . Thanks for that . Yeah , I'm scared straight . Anna , you're next ! I want a baby dragon . - Megan ? - Huh ? - What do you think ? - It's good . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Okay , I'll finish it . I told her not to . You feel anything ? Not yet . I like what you said before ... about thinking more about somebody else . Yeah . I think that's what being a mom is supposed to be about ... you know ? - Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not like I know what I'm talking about , but ... No , I ... I think you do . - You're gon na be a good mom . - ? Sugar blues ? - Thank you . - ? Everybody's singing the sugar ... ? Huh . Good evening , ladies . - Good evening . - Hi , Luke . Oh , wh ... What is ... ? What's that noise ? You hear that ? It's so weird . I feel like there's , uh ... Oh ... Oh . You know you want it . Shh ! Okay , don't make it a sex thing . It is a sex thing . Don't pretend it's not . Ready ? Oh ... Oh , there it is . - I ... I can't . - You can . Chew , swallow . The world will not implode , I swear . Come on , do it . Do it . Do it . - God . - Right ? - Hmm . - Touch it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't be so gross . - Come on , just a little . Get it on you . Come on , get it on you . Right ? Okay . Now , a little bite ... for me . - For you ? - Mm-hmm . I didn't even like you until five minutes ago , so , like ... - Maybe just , you know , not ... - You like me . - You like me . - Shut up . - She likes me . - Shut up . - Don't press your luck . - She likes me . You like me . - Take a bite . - Can we be done ? - You like me . Come on . Have a little bite . - Okay , seriously , back off ! God ... Coward . Tomorrow , you bite . Luke just made me touch chocolate . - He's so weird . - He's totally weird sometimes . I think the baby just moved . Smell that . Yeah , get in on that . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragons . How are you doing after family therapy ? It's pretty much how it always is when my folks are together . - Minus your dad . - Like I said . But I don't feel as bad as I thought I was going to . Why do you think that is ? I'm getting to know some of the people in the house . Some of them actually seem like they're doing okay . - I hope so . - No , I mean , really okay . Like they might get lives and be semi-interesting people . Did you just say something vaguely optimistic ? I did say "" semi "" ... but ... yeah . - So , the family ... - Can I be honest ? I've talked about my dad , all that family stuff . I have issues . Whatever . Talk is not helping . I think you're right . - Really ? - Generally , I just need a few facts . And we're never doing family therapy again . It doesn't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yeah , that's what my sister said . - I liked her . - Yeah , me too . We get along great . - I could tell . She was the only one who had something to say that wasn't entirely self-serving . Yeah . - Now , I'm gon na be honest with you . - Uh-oh . - I'm not crazy about your name . - What ? "" Ellen "" doesn't suit you . It's too old-fashioned . - I've never really liked it . - So , change it . I can't just change it . I can't , right ? Just tell people to call you by a different name . Or , if you wan na make it legal , you can fill out a form online in about ten minutes . I was thinking "" Ellie . "" - Ooh ... - That's no good . No . How about ... "" Eli "" ? Call me "" Eli . "" - You get your iPad ? - Oh , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put on some lbs . - Eli ? - Yeah . Don't tell me you're gay now , too . The male population can not take another quality defection . - Most definitely not gay . - Thank God . No , "" Eli "" is a ... new name for me . Ellen ... Eli ... Hm , I like it . It's very ... George Sand . You're dazzling . You know that , Eli ? So , I'm officially inviting Eli to my dinner out tomorrow night . As part of my reward , I can take anyone I want . Um , I'm not really restaurant ready , but thanks . It can be your pick . It doesn't even have to be on Mr . Gold's essential 100 . No , you should take someone who bites and chews ... We can walk there . All the way to Hollywood or wherever , and you don't have to eat . Can I run ? - I don't run , psycho . My knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read that it doesn't matter how fast you walk . It's distance . You burn the same amount of calories . - That's bullshit . - Will you just slow down a little ? I'm not even going that fast . Um ... I will have the number 12 with the rice and the egg roll . Mm-hmm . Can I have the Tom Tum Kai soup ? - It comes with your entr ? e . - Oh , that's all ... She'll have the number 12 , too , with the egg roll . No . - Yes . - No . She'll have the number 12 , too , with the egg roll . - And to drink ? - We'll have two Tsingtao . Your ID ? I ... I don't wan na put you on the spot or anything , um ... but we're from the hospice . For cancer . Um ... - I'm sorry . I can't serve you without ID . - It's just , um ...

Oh ... ? - Are you ... ? - ? Oh ... ? You are so wrong . - Hmm ? - Mm-hmm . - Bite . - I don't like egg rolls . Who doesn't like egg rolls ? Chew and spit if you wan na be lame , but you look thinner . If I taste it , will you leave me alone ? If you taste everything , I will leave you alone . Oh , yeah . So good . - Yeah . - Mm . - Mm ! - Right ? It's good , right ? Uh-huh . Mm . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Jesus Christ . That was a thing of great beauty . - That's super hot . - I know . It's what I was going for . So , I find out I can pull the patient ID thing all the way up my arm and hide it underneath my T-shirt , and I just get out past the nurse's station , I just walk out . - Where were you even going ? - The beach ? I don't even know . But there I am , just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard . I'm a full-on crazy person , and I'm jogging at the light ... when my mom drives up . - She was on the way to the hospital . - Oh , my God . You don't like it ? No , I do . It's just , um ... She ... She just gets a bit nauseous because of , um ... the chemo . But it tastes really good . The beer really helps . - I'll get you another one , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Oh , my God . - No charge . - Oh , my God , we're going to hell . Yeah . - Did he try to kiss you ? - Ew ! Does he even like girls ? No . I don't know . What I'm trying to say is , why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two ? - It was Luke's night out . - Yeah , but Ellen got to go . It's "" Eli "" now . It might make you feel better to know that Dr . Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days . - Tell me it's not the Holocaust Museum . - No . My mother took me there to make me feel shitty , you know , about starving . It's okay . We're Jewish . Damn , Dr . Beck . Are you trying to turn me straight ? That's a different program . - Hi , everyone . - Hey ! Okay , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some strings to get us in there , so you have to behave . Tell us . I can't stand it . Tell us ! Tell us !

I just thought , if you knew I wanted it to be good or different ... And you're falling in love with me ? Okay , I'm sorry . I didn't mean to unleash the Kraken . - I've known you for , like , three weeks . - Well , I've known you for two years . Your drawing , the way you see things ... Yeah ? Oh , okay . This rexie girl , who saw my stuff on Tumblr , liked the way I saw ... so much , that when she slit her wrists , she left me the fucking note . And you know what her parents did ? They sent me pictures ... so I 'd really know what I 'd done . People say they love you ... but what they mean is , they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves . Or ... Or they love what they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with that . That's all kinds of wrong . I'm done . Okay , all right , you win ! All right ? You're the queen of darkness . Hey , come on ! - Megan ! - Megan ? Megan ! Megan , it's Luke ! Let me in ! I thought I was safe . I know , I know . It's gon na be okay . I know . I'm sorry . Guys , go back to bed . Can you push a baby out by throwing up too hard ? Yeah , that's exactly how it happens . Don't be an idiot . Good morning . - Good morning . - Hi . How's Megan ? She's at the hospital . She's fine now , physically . She's not sure she wants to come back here ... which I understand . Can we visit her ? Not yet , but I think , in a few days , that's exactly what she needs . I wan na go home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . That's not negotiable . What is , is how you deal with it . Would you read this ? - Do I have to ? - No . Okay . ' "" Courage ' by Anne Sexton . It is in the small things that we see it . The child's first step , as awesome as an earthquake . The first time you rode a bike , wallowing up the sidewalk . The first spanking , when your heart went on a journey all alone . When they called you ' crybaby ' or ' poor ' or ' fatty ' or ' crazy ' ... and made you into an alien ... you drank their acid and you concealed it . "" "" Later , if you faced the death of bombs and bullets ... you did not do it with a banner . You did it with only a hat to cover your heart . You did not fondle the weakness inside you though it was there . Your courage was a small coal that you kept swallowing . "" So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that ? It's her fault . She was purging . I think Megan wanted her baby . I really think she did . - We shouldn't have had the shower . - No , I don't think it was that . Eli , you and Luke found her . That must have been hard . That baby was never gon na make it . - Where is Luke , anyway ? - He's at the doctor for his knee . Eli ? Eli . What's going on with you ? Nothing . Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube . You've been making progress , but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight . I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me ... and I don't know anything about you . Okay , what do you wan na know ? - Do you have a wife ? - No . - Do you have kids ? - No . So , what's your damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my time , and I ... I like it that way . Women generally wan na spend time with somebody they date . Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy , doctor . Yeah , I guess it does . Lobo also tells me that you and Luke aren't speaking . It seemed like you and Luke had something good going . Whatever . He's totally gay . That would be easier , right ? Then you could write him off . - Does he talk to you about me ? - You know I can't answer that . - I just don't see the point . - In what ? There is no point . Or at least , big picture , we don't get to know what it is . Why we live , why Megan lost the baby , why that girl killed herself . - You're not reassuring me , doctor . - I can't reassure you . This idea you have that there's a way to be safe ... it's childish and cowardly . It stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't think I feel bad enough already ? I know I'm messed up ... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be . You know how . Stop waiting for life to be easy . Stop hoping for somebody to save you . You don't need another person lying to you . Things don't all add up . But you're resilient . Face some hard facts and you could have an incredible life . That's your pearl of wisdom ? Grow a pair ? That's a more concise way of putting it . Yeah . Unbelievable . Fuck you . - What's going on ? - Beck's messed up , you know that ? We all buy the hype , but nobody here is getting any better . - That's not true . - Yeah ? Megan's screwed . Anna has a treasure chest of puke under her bed . You live in fucking Ponyland . I'm about to get the tube , and he doesn't even care . Shit . I need another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey Ballet . Seriously ? Yeah . Come on , put your bag down . Let's go get another cancer beer . I can't . Sorry . I'm actually out of here . Did you hear what I said ? I'm finished . And you're leaving ? I can't . What , you think I didn't guess my knee was fucked ? And now that I'm done doing the one thing that makes me feel , you're my next thing . I know that that's not a plan . It's not a good one , anyway . But I need you ... Eli . Okay . Thank you . Bye . - Thank you . - Sure . There is no point . That girl killed herself . You look like a ghost . If you die ... I will kill you . You okay , honey ? I ... I just got up too fast . Sorry . You need to eat , girl . I'm fine . But thank you . I just need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your patients can just walk off like that and nobody stops her ? The problem with treatment for some of these kids ... is that we won't let them hit bottom . It's too hard to watch . But for Eli , the bottom is critical . How is there even less of you ? What did that doctor do to you ? Hi , Mom . - Is this all you've got ? - Yeah . All right . Well , everybody's waiting for you . - "" Everybody "" ? - Horses . They're very sweet beasts . Olive and I were worried that it wasn't gon na work out with that doctor . - Well , he had such an attitude . - Oh , God complex . - Totally dismissive . - And Susan ... - I mean , he really let her attack us . - He just wanted everybody to be honest . I don't like to speak negatively , but that woman's never said an honest word in her life . Of course , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fought really hard to get me into Threshold House . Yeah , look how well that turned out . And how about the way she talked about your mother's breakdowns ? They were transformational for me . Everybody should have more breakdowns . You didn't feel that way about them when they happened . Dr . Beckham called here earlier . He thought you might turn up . - He did ? What did you say ? - Well , that you 'd decided to leave . He wanted to make sure you were okay . A boy wanted to speak with you . Luke ? Is this somebody special ? I don't know . He ... He's my friend , kind of ... It all got fucked up . In the morning , Olive would like you to work with Freya . The horse ? Olive has grown tremendously out here . You'll thank me . But isn't that kind of like a conflict ? Her giving me therapy ? Freya does all the work . I'm just a conduit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduit . There's no electricity , but I think ... It's not so cold . You'll be okay . - You're gon na sleep , anyway . - Yeah , I'm tired . There's a bedpan here . So , if you need it ... It's better than stumbling around in the dark . Okay . - People pay money to stay here ? - It's rustic . They love it . - Ellen ... - "" Eli . "" You know , "" Ellen "" was your great-grandmother's name . I bet she didn't like it either . You know , I ... had a premonition before you came . - Really ? - You were a baby . I didn't hold you enough . I didn't bond with you . And , of course , that's true . I didn't know about postpartum depression . - I don't think that's it . - Well , anyway ... I spoke to Jean Williamson about it . Do you remember her ? - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Light . She's very interested in Olive's work and has been ... a great comfort to me around your illness . And she ... feels that it would be healing for the both of us if you allowed me to feed you . - It's rice milk . I made it myself . - Like a baby ? Well , like a mother and a child . I could hold you and rock you , and you could go to sleep . Uh , I don't know . No , I know . I know it's odd . But ... Well , as she said it , I felt real clarity that that's what we need . Can I think about it ? Yeah , okay . There's , uh ... not much left of you to lose . You know that ? - Dr . Beckham made that clear . - I know . Hmm . He said it's your choice , whether you come back or not . But I could tell that he was afraid that you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ... I know . I'm sorry . And ... I just want you to know that ... I accept it if ... If death is what you want , I accept it now . I accept it , but um ... I love you . I just ... I can't keep fighting you . All right . Okay . Mom ? Yeah ? Feed me , please . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Can you hold this ? Hold on . Okay . Do you mind if I put your feet down ? Okay . Are you comfortable ? Okay . - Yeah ? Okay . - Yeah . ? Hush little baby ? ? Don't say a word ? ? Mama's gon na buy you a mockingbird ? ? And if that mockingbird don't sing ? ? Mama's gon na buy you a diamond ring ? ? And if that diamond ring turns brass ? ? Mama's gon na buy you a looking glass ? Okay . You need to get out of the sun . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to know that ... I accept it . - I just don't see the point . - There is no point . Can you please just try this time ? Not too good . Not perfect . Pretty . I don't get to have a sister . You're dazzling . You know that ? I do not . Shit . Hey . I need you to look . Oh , my God . Is that me ? That's me . Your courage is a small coal that you keep swallowing . Not dead . ? Follow ? ? Follow the sun ? ? And which way the wind blows ? ? When this day is done ? ? And breathe ? ? Breathe in the air ? ? Cherish this moment ? ? Cherish this breath ? I'm gon na be okay . Whatever . You do this again , I'm gon na punch you in the vagina . - You sure ? - Yeah . Okay . Okay . ?

"@@6860500 If no-one has any objections . I was wondering if we might take Mildred Lynch first . She a possible parolee and she's been waiting for quite a while . Is it agreed ? Mildred Lynch first ? Well , if I might just have a chance to glance at her file . What's in the classification report , Mrs May ? Mildred is popular in her college , though no-one can quite understand why . She's made no close friends , and doesn't seem to really like the other girls . But her manner is so ingratiating it seems to have got her by . What was her sentence ? Indeterminate . At the discretion of the board . She is still reluctant to face real and difficult situations . However , she has to some extent overcome the handicaps of her early background . She attends church services . Catholic and Protestant . And attends the Alcoholic's Anonymous meetings . That's been one of our troubles with her . Trying to do everything . Naturally , when she feels it will impress us . Such an eager beaver . Doesn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can continue our discussion later . Have Mildred come in . Oh , Mrs Crawford , you won't mind changing places with me ? This way , I won't be so much in her line of vision . Sit down , Mildred . You are in here on a forgery charge , consisting of passing bad checks . Yes , ma'am . But I can explain it . I thought the check would be alright . A friend of mine said he 'd cover it . You have a previous conviction in the county jail in Nevada ? Yes , ma'am . For receiving stolen goods . A fur coat . - Yes . But I didn't know it was stolen . You see , a friend gave it to me . Mildred . Mrs Harris is not at this moment asking for your excuse . That's all passed . Miss Holman and other members of the prison staff . Have been trying to fit you in to the life outside . We're bringing you here today to see if you're ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here again . We hope not . But other girls have said that before . They all make the same promises and they believe them . At the time . - Yes , I know . Well , maybe they haven't become genuinely conscious of their wrong . A very good answer , Mildred . Oh , I mean it , Mr Neeley . You have to be corrected inside . It isn't enough just to let your hair grow back . You know , falsifying has been one of your worst problems . Not only the lies you've told us , but also the lies you've told yourself . You thought you didn't deserve to be here . That ... What you did wasn't criminal . You still feel it wasn't ? I know now , that all my life I was headed that way . I thought I could steal ... anywhere . Even when I was a kid . Maybe I was lucky to get in here when I did . I've tried to improve myself in here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yes . We know all about that . But how do you feel about yourself ? Well . I'm sure willing to take a chance on it . I can only hope you will . Where is your family , Mildred ? Mildred ... Was abandoned when she was eleven . Alright , Mildred . If you'll step outside so we can further consider your parole . Then it isn't definite ? We'll call you . Wait across the hall . Yes , ma'am . Well , what do you think ? She is pretty , Mr Neeley . I move to grant parole under proper auspices . I second that . As soon as provision for parole can be arranged by the Parole Officer . All those in favor , say "" Aye "" . - Aye . - Aye . - Aye . Opposed ? - Majority carried , didn't it ? Have Mildred come back . I think she's a good risk . Sit down , Mildred . The board has just granted your parole . I'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sorry about . It's all so wonderful . I don't know what to say . Well , if you can think a minute , where would you like to go ? Well , somewhere new , so I could really start over . There is one in your pocket . What about Los Angeles ? We have a Parole Officer there who should be very good for you . That's okay . - Joan Willburn . She's young and understanding . Some of the girls told me I could take a new name . I always went for Diane . Diane Stewart , I thought . Diana , the huntress ? Who's that ? Mildred , maybe I'm being a little too hard on you . I'm an old fogy . You'll have to forgive me . No you're not . You're sweet . You all are . You understand , that parole is just a continuation of your sentence ? It's serving time on the outside . That being a prisoner still , you'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the Parole Office can find a job and a home for you . You'll be informed . With your ticket of leave , you'll receive $25 in cash to carry you over . And a dress and a coat . - A dress ? What kind of a dress ? - One made here in our shop . Oh . That will be nice . Well . Let your actions on the outside thank us . I hope we're right . All of us . All ? - Oh , you wet blanket . My male instinct . Which warns me that this young woman ... Is going to make things a lot harder for herself than she needs to . I would like to have spared her . Diane . Diane Stewart . I'm Joan Willburn . Hello . Oh . Hello . I was expecting a uniform . - I was expecting you to be different . Any objections ? - No . That's up to you . Is that the going-away outfit they gave you ? There was a blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My car is there . Where's your bag ? - Over here . Cigarette ? - Thanks . We rolled them ourselves up there . Most people don't like them . So , what's the job ? Nurse's aide in a private hospital here . If you don't like it ... You shouldn't have done such fine work at the prison hospital . It won't be so bad . I 'd like to be where there is life . Holy Toledo , Miss Willburn . Dames bossing you . Waiting on them . You don't know how I hate women . There are men patients , too . I like my men on their feet . I was talking about your work . Not your personal life . What did you have in mind ? Waitress . Cigarette girl . I don't know . - Like before ? That didn't work out too well . Diane ... it isn't easy to find jobs . Hospitals need helpers . They're even willing to take convicts . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You'll save car-fare . - You think of everything . Well , so your friend got here . Mrs Seeley ... Miss Stewart . - Hi . Well , I hope you're going to stay longer than that . After I saved that good room for you . I think it will be fine . What did you tell her ? She know about me ? You'll have to get over that . No-one knows . No-one has to . Except Mrs Haley at the hospital . And she doesn't talk . Don't you want to use it yourself ? You've paid for it . Not too bad . I was in here earlier . Opened it up for you . And plenty of closet space . That's another reason I chose the hospital . Because they provide uniforms . You don't have to worry about work clothes . They don't have full length one's up there . They think anything below the neck is unimportant . Well ... thanks for everything . And the flowers . We shall greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That's part of the job . And now what about dinner ? Is that part of the job too ? As it's your first evening , I thought we 'd go out on the town . If the State is picking up the check . Anyway , I 'd like to see your idea of "" going out on the town "" . I'll pick you up at seven . Well ... here's to a wild night on tomato juice . I'm sorry about that . But one of the first rules of taking ... - No drinking . I know . Well cheers , Miss Willburn . - Cheers , Diane . And now for dessert . Meringue glac ? e ? Peach Melba ? As you wish ? I'll have a chocolate sundae with chocolate ice-cream and nuts . Lots of whipped cream and heavy on the sauce . Yes , madam . And for you , Miss Willburn ? The same . Yes , Miss Willburn . Is that on the expense-account , too ? - Of course . Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Collins just came in . He's in the bar . Shall I tell him you are here ? - Oh , thank you . I'll do it . Who's that ? A friend . I'll only be a minute . Thank you . Now I'm not even supposed to kiss you ? Not when I'm on the job . I can't concentrate . Not when you're out with a pigeon , you mean . These girls are parolees , Larry . Not convicts . Excuse me . Excuse me . Parolees . How about a drink ? - I can't . I'm sorry about dinner . - Ah ... The fourth time in a row . - I know . I don't think much of your girl , either . I'll have another Martini , Jim . Baby , I don't know what I'm going to do with you . Most kids say : "" I think I'll be a Countess when I grow up or a fireman or Jane Russell . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grow up I'm going to be a Parole Officer . I'll never have dinner with the man I love ... As I'll always be eating out with a pigeon . Parolee . What do I have to do to get you to marry me ? Rob a bank ? I don't think that would help . I've been waiting a long time , Joan . Why don't you marry me and take me out of all this ? Larry . Okay ... I'll stop bothering you . If you stopped bothering me , I don't know what I 'd do . Darling . Don't you think you're being very silly tossing me on the open market like this ? I tell you . I'll be snapped up like hot cakes . I'll have to take that chance . Okay . Now , how about that drink ? Tell you what , I'll buy you both one . That's a chocolate sundae with chocolate ice-cream and nuts . Lots of whipped cream and heavy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had in mind . Okay , Jim . Tell Mr Connors I had to leave . I'll call him , Yes , madam . Diane . I told you I didn't want anyone to know here . Anyone . Turn that sign off , Diane . - What sign ? In big letters . "" I just come from prison "" . No-one will know unless you tell them . Men always asks questions . You know that . I didn't have a story ready . Larry's a friend . Besides , I asked him here to see me . Because he's your friend ? He wouldn't look at me I suppose ? You 'd be surprised . Look , Diane . I asked you out tonight because you're alone here . Most of the other girls have families to come to . This is a new town for you . You have no-one . You think that alone , I 'd get into trouble . Is that it ? No , that not it . It was your first evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ... it was nice of you . And now you don't have to see me again for thirty days . You report to my office on the 12th of each month . If you should need me in the meantime ... - I won't . I hope not . Well ... sleep well and late . You don't have to report for work until eight o'clock tomorrow night . Night ? Well ... I thought I told you . The night shift ? That's right . We'll see if we can get you on the day shift later . Hah ... thanks for leaving the best until the last . There goes my social life . Goodnight , Miss Wilburn . Something wrong with rolling my own ? It's a prison habit . I wouldn't do it outside . Goodnight . Thanks , Reg . - Anybody else got a check ? How about you , Diane . You've been here a week . For you , no charge . - It must be love . I don't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s waiting for a rich patient . Just you be patient . I'll be rich . Don't start on me . And don't charge me for that extra cup of coffee . You must have one evening off . When you get a convertible top on that ambulance , we'll go out with you . Man and wife . - Diane . Go on , Tilly ... go on . Hello . You said I don't have to see you until report day . - You don't . I talked to Mrs Haley today . She's very pleased with you . She says you're very willing . - Does she ? I get along . So , I just cashed my pay check . Alright ? - Of course . I'll pay my room rent as soon as I get home . I don't owe a nickel . - Good . Well . Thanks for not checking up on me . Goodnight , Miss Willburn . A friend of yours ? - A patient . I see her now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parole Office ? Who do you think you're kidding ? Are you a parolee too , Tilly ? - Glad to meet you . Of Miss Willburn ? - No . Miss Johnson . Parole Officers are all alike . They stink . Yeah . Right . That's the way I used to feel about it . You'll get over it . Funny I didn't see you up there . - I've been out a while . Make way , please . Thank you . The class of ' 47 . What little green pen were you in up there ? Ah ... Dormer House . Still got the same matron ? Yes . Mrs Baker is still the sorority house mother . What's a sorority ? Baker's an old pop , but she sure was a good sorority . What's with you ? - I think I know him . You mean , you wish you did ? My big idea is two to one . I thought it was after visiting hours . He doesn't know it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? He happens to be a friend of a friend of mine . Look , Diane . Save yourself the trouble . You think you're out of prison ? Well , you 'd better catch it now . You got a wall around you a mile high . You'll find out . All we rate are crooks , petty thieves , and if we're real lucky ... A great big ... ? - Oh , I look like a paper bag . Try it off the shoulder . - Shut up . Scramble your seams . That way he'll notice your legs . Yeah . I'll try it . How did you think of a thing like that ? I have to . You're on duty , Diane . - Yes , Mrs Haley . I see you two have found each other . Leave her alone , Tilly . She's doing fine . And I suppose I'm not ? A warning is only fair . There's been quite a few things missing lately . Thermometers ... Hypodermic needles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accusation . But you know who the first suspects always are , unfortunately . X-Ray me , why don't you ? That's what I mean ... by "" fair warning "" . I want to see you girls get a break . Then search me any time you like . Come now . Get to work , Tilly . My leg's been broken a month , and suddenly you turn up . Why ? Well , first . I like you , Cliff . Second , you're my boss And last but not least the ... The cost of living has gone up so ... - Absolutely no . [Door_knocks] Come in . Well , how's my favorite patient ? Oh ... oh , company . I can see you don't need this . Beer makes me sleepy . You sleep alright at night if you didn't nap all day . I've got Miss Hansen in the daytime . I 'd much rather sleep through her than you . How about that , Larry ? Not having seen Miss Hansen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate anything crooked . Don't you ? Oh ... excuse me . Nothing like a nice fresh bed . It makes a lot of difference , don't you think ? I hate a mussed-up bed myself . Don't you ? Sheets ought to be pulled nice and tight . No wrinkles . Cool and smooth . Nice soft pillows . There ... all we have to do is get into it . Here we go . - Thank you . By the way , this is Larry Collins . Miss Stewart . - How do you do ? How do you do ? - He used to be a good reporter . Now , he puts out the worst-organized column in our paper . You ever tried to read it ? - No . But I will . Thank you . A little higher . There you go . - Thank you . Comfortable ? - Oh , yes . Everything alright ? - Yes , thank you . How about another blanket ? - Oh , no , no . Some water ? - No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Oh ... oh , I'm sorry . May I ? - Help yourself . Cute ? - Uhuh . And obvious . "" Stat ... is ... tician . "" Oh . If you're the average reader , it's no wonder I can't get a raise . I wasn't sleeping . I was thinking . I enjoyed your column very much . - Thanks . The parts I could understand . Now look , Miss ... - Stewart . Stewart . You seemed bright enough in there . And out here ? Would you mind handing me that paper ? Now then . Is it the first paragraph that perplexes you ? Would you sit down please ? With the possible exception of alert statisticians . You are aware that in recent years ... There has been a drastic redistribution of the population of the United States . Most of the migrants , understandably enough , have chosen California ... As their new home . The population , revealed by last year's census reveals that ten million souls ... That means "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator's here . Once again , more than a hundred years after the gold-rush . The eyes of American are turned towards the West . In simple language , that means that an awful lot of people are moving out here . I don't suppose you understood the second section either ? Yes . Yes I did . Only I've never seen a midget auto race . [Buzzer] I'll send you a ticket sometime . - I hate to do things alone . Well , I'll send you two tickets . - I don't know anybody . Alright then . I'll take you myself . Now , can I go ? Are they racing tomorrow ? It's my night off . [Buzzer] I'll pick you up at eight . I ... I said I won't be able to make it . Oh ... I got to hooked for dinner . Yeah . Something my dear boss got me into . That should break your day . Well , of course if you don't know where to find her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sorry , Larry . Oh , darling . She can't be that bad . Oh dear . I did want to see you . I wanted to tell you ... Oh , never mind . Another time . And try to have a good time tonight . Goodbye , darling . Excuse me . Look , you say I should go out and make friends . How can I when I haven't got anything to wear ? But that's a very pretty dress . It should be . I've changed it , switched it , turned it inside out . Now I'll try it upside down . I don't mind all that , but I've just got to have a new coat . I know it's a problem . - You don't . You don't care . What's the matter with the coat you have ? A raincoat . - Well , maybe it will rain . And why is it so important ? Who did you say asked you ? Rex Fisher . The boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking , but he has a good job , and I'll meet a few people . It looks funny . What will I tell him ? Where was I supposed to be before ? A nudist camp ? You are pretty , Diane . And clothes don't make the woman . They sure help make the man . Couldn't you loan me the money , Miss Willburn ? An advance on my salary . No , Diane . I'm governed by rules , too . I'm sorry . Well ... thanks . Sorry I bothered you . - Have a good time anyway . You know what you can do . Molly , look at that coat . - You just bought a new coat . Oh , I can't help it . This was made for me . That's a size twelve , dear . Well anyway I've just got to try it on . Come on . You own these ? - Not this one . Oh , Miss . Where are the short coats ? Something light to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Yes . What color would you like ? - Oh , something bright . I'm getting tired of this black . I've a darling little box coat . Kelly green . It just came in . It will be lovely with your hair . Would you return this to the rack , please . I've decided against it . Tired ? You don't look so good . No . I'm alright , thanks . Oh . Your coat came from the cleaners . I put it in the closet . My coat ? - Yeah . The boy said you wanted it especially for tonight . Thank you . Oh , Larry . Larry , he's dead ! I know he's dead . Well , if he is , he forgot to lie down . That's him walking away . - Oh . Sit down in front . You sure you won't have a drink ? No thank you . What do you say we beat it ? Sure . No .

I'm not talking about us . - I know . Don't keep saying "" I know "" . - I can't help it . I do know . I suppose you know her name and what she eats for dinner . Her name is Diane Stewart .

The first conviction when she was twelve . Now . Do you know what an indeterminate sentence is ? Generally set by the prison board . Indeterminate because they vary . There is a minimum and maximum prescribed by law . Our board gave her five years . She served nearly two . That makes three to go . That's a long time . Can't we get her less ? Not unless the board feels she's corrected . How can they know ? How can anyone know ? That's the point . Unless she's had a chance to prove herself . You can't correct a criminal . - Stop it , Joan . The file is right about one thing at least . She does think and act like a twelve year old sometimes . Look around you . Who doesn't ? At least she's trying to do something about it . Do you want to marry her ? She's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I don't know either . There ought to be a rule .

The board has a special meeting , Thursday . They'll get my recommendation in time . I 'd like to talk to the board . The board has a rule . No lawyers , no lovers . But you don't have to worry about it . I'll take care of it myself . You interviewed this man at some length ? I had the usual interview . As I wrote here . You consider that sufficient time ...

Mr Collins is fairly well known . - Why , I happen to be fan of his . On sports in particular , he's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan of yours . We consider you a remarkable girl . Yet you doubt my report ? Oh , this is unfair . Let her read the letter . Mildred wrote us a few days ago . The letter came up this morning along with your report . Whatever she could say was ... - Read it aloud , please .

Then why did you bend backward in this report ? Do you expect me to be unfair to the girl because he prefers her to me ? Of course not . But you can carry your loyalty to these young women too far , Miss Willburn . Diane feels I 'd let my personal feelings affect my duty as a Parole Officer . She made a mistake . So did I . I thought she trusted me . But . But surely you can understand why she didn't ? When all her life she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back her civil rights . It's important .

In this case we 'd like to make an exception and talk to Mr Collins . When ? I'll get him up here . No hurry ... next month's board meeting . Slowly Miss Willburn , slowly . We'll see how things work out . Now we have other cases . I just don't know how she'll take this . Maybe that's important to find out too . What are you so droopy about ? There's someone looking for you , Tilly . Excuse me . Is it okay ? What did the board say ? Diane . Why did you write that letter ? - The board did grant permission ? Or did they ? They will ... they ... They didn't get to it this time . - Why not ? I told you . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did get to it . That's why I wrote them . To be sure they would . Diane , you've got to trust someone in this world . Like who ? You ? Time . That's the way you'll do it isn't it , Miss Willburn ? No letters to the board . None of that stuff . Just a postponement . Time . That's what you're counting on . - Oh , Diane . Hey , Diane . There's a call for you . I had it switched through the hospital . Give me a club and I'll go after her for you . Honest . Diane , we've only got two months to go . All my life all I wanted was to beat time . It can't be done . Up there ... or down here either . They've got us licked . She didn't get rid of it did she , in the lunch wagon ? The boyfriend is still in there . Got him spotted . You should have waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . Keep everybody away . What's the use of trying ? You can't win anyway . Will you step in here , girls ? We're asking a check tonight . What for ? - Routine . Everyone else has . I don't have on my fancy underwear . So , if it's all the same to you , some other time . Keep your head , Tilly . I'll help you . Now , please . You first , Miss Thompson . You have a warrant ? - Just asking for co-operation . Beat it , Tilly . Let me go . You can't frisk me without at a warrant . - Save it for the jail , sister . More resistance , more time . What did you do ? Pick his pocket while you were taking his pulse ? So she don't want to be sociable . They can't hold us . They didn't find anything . Yeah ? You never heard the word "" suspicion "" ? It covers a multitude . I've been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big round up don't you ? They're trying to get enough of us for a line-up . Tomorrow morning , I hear . They can't put us in one .

Lily ... don't you recall ? Was you busy . You made so many flags you were beginning to look like Betsy Ross . Always playing up to everybody . Mildred ? She's doing scrumptious . Mildred . She's an honorary . A regular little teacher's pet . - Stop it , will you . Why , we'll all soon be back up there . Personally I won't mind . They'll go easy on me . I've got a low IQ . I'm not going back . I'm getting out of here . Matron ... matron ! I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my Parole Officer . Please call her . No visitors after twelve o'clock . - It's my right . I've got to get out of here . I have to get out of here . Please . The witching hour . Goodnight , kid . Hello , Miss Willburn . It's that girl . She called for me ? - Somebody did , I see . Oh , a Mr Collins came . He's already gone in . You let him in ? Well , Mr Collins is a man you don't keep out . You know , we don't like people walking in on a line-up just for entertainment . We're after that stick-up girl . The one that's pulling all those jobs over on Third Street . She makes us nervous . Oh , and about that Thompson kid . We picked up her boyfriend . You know , you girls ought to take better care of your chickens . You one of the victims ? Okay . Member of the family . That's all . Next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Where do you reside ? What ? - Keep your eyes front . Where are you taking off your shoes these days , Amy ? 404 , Second Avenue . L.A . Since when ? - Four months . Talk up . Before that ? Dallas . How much time did you do there ? It's no secret you know . Speak up . Three years . Grand theft auto . What are you doing here ? Suspicion of burglary . That's all . Next . Frieda Lockwood . I don't feel very good . A little hungover this morning , Frieda ? What's a sweet girl like you doing dead drunk in crummy dump like the Bluebell ? My boyfriend works there . Sorry this happened . Have you tried to get her out of this ? I got no place . Just made thing worse . That's all . Any of you want to hold them for a further look ? The second from the right , I think . Second from the right , stay . That's all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get the line out ... I'm going to try something . No , don't . Don't let her know you're here . She couldn't take it . Let's have a little more quiet out there if you want to hear them . They are all modest as daisies . Step it up , girls . We haven't got all morning . Speak Annabelle . - Annabelle Burns . No address . I just got here . A nice welcome they give you in this State . What was found on you when you were picked up ? A wallet . The first time I've heard it called that . You'll have plenty of time for jokes , later . Next . The nerve . Hauling me here on a line-up . You know where I am every night . Tilly Thompson . Previous offense , manslaughter . Paroled three years . Two months to go . Present offense . Suspicion of theft . Not exactly suspicion . We've got your boyfriend and he talked , Tilly . Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And next . You . Norma Johnson . I don't live anywhere . I'm from Chicago . Hello , Miss Willburn . Too bad we got some of yours here . Do me a favor . Diane Stewart . Don't force her in the line-up . Those victims expect a crowd . 18 to 30 . Slight . Medium height . I'll stand in for her . - No stand-ins today . Diane , why did you send for me ? Larry is not out there ? - Of course not . They told me they told him when he called the hospital . Diane , it will be alright . I'm going to see the judge myself . I'll get you out of this . Your turn at the pony chorus . Step up . Name ? Margie Constance . Please , I'm going to be sick . - Where do you live ? Sixth Street . I forget the number . Any other numbers you forget ? You ! Put your hand down . Like 426a in the penal code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some water . John , check her out . We'll save her for tonight's show . Alright , sister . Put your hand down . I can't see . The lights are blinding me . Oh honey , don't get stage-fright . You're giving a wonderful performance . How will we bill you ? Name , sister ? Name , I said . Or do you want me to start talking ? Mildred Lynch . A parolee . In the State Institute For Women . I live at 114 North Hope Street . What else ? I don't know anything about any robbery . Even from the cabinet in the hospital ? No . No , sir . Somebody got a question ? I 'd like to see her with her hair pulled back . Off her face . You heard the lady . Oblige her . Put your hair back . Don't do it , Diane . You don't have to . I warned you . You oughtn't to come in here . I don't care who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't do it ! Come on ... come on ... Alright , sister . We're waiting . Do as your told . Next . It's almost over now . Please trust me . We'll have to hurry . The judge only promised us a few minutes . Some , we can never correct . Those we can , we've got to fight for . If you insist you acknowledge the arrest you must think of what it does to her . Another conviction won't go easy with her . Your board of trustees up there is pretty lenient ... too lenient . I know many of the judges hate an indeterminate sentence . I can understand . But how can you in a few hours in a courtroom know her entire background ? Not only for the ... Punishment she deserves . But for the help she needs . Also , in a courtroom a judge listens to lawyers . You would make a good one yourself , Miss Willburn . If you 'd said "" honest "" I would like that better . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can't just dismiss this . The girl herself admits she was guilty of interfering with these officers . Yes ? Her interference didn't exactly mar my duty , Judge Kendall . Granted , she was wrong , but ... We understand that on this particular night ... She was working on him too , I see . Now that we know that she has no connection with the Tilly Thompson case . Anything you want to do is okay with us . The point is , Your Honor ... There are rules laid out in the penal code that even our board can't ignore . If you convict this girl , it's got to add to her time . The charge , interfering with an officer carrying out his duties , is dismissed . With this provision . That the behaviour of this parolee be considered a parole violation . And the prisoner returned to the State Institute For Women . But Judge Kendall . As you say , Miss Willburn , I'm a busy man , so if you will excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now . You said one minute , Miss Willburn . You won't have much more . One minute against three years . - What ? That's what she'll get if you send her back to prison . Are they still in there ? Diane . Union Station . Mind if I go along ? Leave me alone . I know what I'm doing . You mean trying to break your neck or run away ? You still haven't reached the point . - I think I have . If you send this girl back to prison . Nobody has gained a thing . - Yes . If you don't , there's a good chance we'll have a decent , useful citizen . Just one moment . - Please take that chance . I don't know ... you are very convincing . Judge Kendall , there is a call for Miss Willburn . He said it was urgent . Tell him , quickly . This is Miss Willburn . - Lost anything ? Diane Stewart . She just left the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd better pick her up before she gets too far . Thanks . Yes . I'll be here for a little while . Let me know . Well , there it is , Miss Willburn . You are a very persuasive young lady and I hope you know what you are doing . Because if anything should go wrong . It would not only be worse for the girl . It would naturally mean your job as well . Good morning , Miss Willburn . Know where you're going ? Mexico ? You're sure ? Okay , come on and sit down . I'll buy you a drink . What will I do ? Scobie ! Scobie , get down from there . Get down from there . Sit down . May I ? I told you the kid was too young to take on a trip , but no ... No . You knew better . Thank you . Thank you . That's our train . That's your train , too . I kinda wish you wouldn't take it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane . When are you going to learn how to walk ? The Judge signed your release , Diane . You certainly make it tough for me . I came back to tell you . I'm sorry I made things so difficult for you . Now ... I don't know what to say . I don't even know how to thank you . You thanked me by coming back . Miss Willburn ... - That's alright . T-G

Somehow our crappy Saturday job at the meatworks becomes full-time . And then Christmas comes and so do the dreaded exam results . The news is not good . A few of our classmates pack their bags for university and shoot through , and suddenly there we are ... Biggie and me , heading to work every morning in the frigid wind in the January of our new lives . Some days I can see me and Biggie out there as old codgers , anchored to the friggin ' place .

In his head , he's always seen himself at the meatworks or the cannery , until he inherits a salmon netting license from his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s not the brightest crayon in the box but he's the most loyal person I know . He's the real deal . We didn't meet until the second week of high school . I was new in town and right from the start , a kid called Tony Macoli became fixated on me . That's how it started ... a single decisive act of violence that joined me to Biggie forever . If you believe him on the subject , he acted more out of animal irritation than charity . But I felt like somebody ransomed and set free . Biggie became my mate , my constant companion . Friendship , I suppose , comes at a price . There have been girls I've disqualified myself from because of Biggie . Not everyone wants to have him tagging along everywhere . Right through high school , I had occasional moments , evenings , encounters with girls , but no real girlfriend , and mostly I don't regret it . Except for Briony Nevis . For two years , we're sort of watching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat-out beautiful . Long , black hair . Glossy skin . Dark eyes . I kiss her once at a party . Well , maybe she kisses me . But there , out of the corner of my eyes , Biggie , alone on the smoky veranda waiting to go home . I don't go to him straight up . I do make him wait a fair old while . But I don't go on with Briony Nevis the way I badly want to because I know Biggie will be left behind ... for good . We pull in to fuel up and use the phone . Biggie decides he's not calling home , so he sits in the VW while I reverse the charges and get an earful . I hang up and find Biggie talking to a chick with a backpack the size of an elephant saddle . She's tall and not very beautiful with long , shiny brown hair and big knees . She thinks she's on the coast road north and she's mortified to discover otherwise . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There isn't really even much consultation . We just pull out with this chick in the back . Meg is her name . Meg is as thick as a box of hammers . It's alarming to see how enthralled Biggie is . And I just drive and try to avoid the rear-view mirror . While I'm thinking about all of this , Biggie's gone and climbed over into the back and Meg's lit up a number and they're toking away on it with their feet up like I'm some kind of chauffeur . Biggie's never had much luck with girls . I should be glad for him . But I'm totally pissed off . We come upon a maze of salt lakes that blaze silver and pearly in the sun . I begin to have the panicky feeling that the land and this very afternoon might go on forever . ( TRAINCROSSINGSIGNALRINGS ) Biggie's really enjoying himself back there . I slowly understand why . There's the obvious thing , of course ... the fact that he's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else ... the thing that eats at me ... is the way he's enjoying being brighter than her , being a step ahead . Feeling somehow senior and secure in himself . It's me all over . It's how I am with him . And it's not pretty . The kombi fills up with smoke again . But this time it's bitter and metallic and I understand we're on fire . Without an extinguisher , there's not much we can do , once we're standing out there in the litter of our belongings , waiting for the VW to explode . But it just smoulders and hisses awhile as the sun sinks behind us . In the end , with the smoke almost gone and the wiring cooked , it's obvious we're not going anywhere . We turn our attention to the sunset . Meg rolls another spliff . We don't say anything . The sun flattens itself against the salt pan and disappears . The sky goes all acid-blue and there's just this huge silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can't imagine an end to the quiet . The horizon fades . Everything looks impossibly far off . In two hours , I'll hear Biggie and Meg in his sleeping bag . She'll cry out like a bird and become so beautiful , so desirable in the total dark that I'll begin to cry . TIM WINTON AND BOY : In a week , Biggie and Meg will blow me off in Broome and I'll be on the bus south for a second chance at the exams . TIM WINTON : In a year , Biggie will be dead in a mining accident in the Pilbara and I'll be reading Robert Louis Stevenson at his funeral . Meg won't show . I'll grow up and have a family of my own and see Briony Nevis , tired and lined in a supermarket queue and wonder what all the fuss was about . All of it unimaginable . Right now , standing with Biggie on the salt lake at sunset , I don't care what happens beyond this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets big around us , so big we just give in and ... watch . Eenie , meenie , minie ... moe . ( SIGHSHAPPILY ) Arggh ! Oh , argh .

Well , I don't know about anyone else , but it's the most fun I've ever had at Christmas . I felt like I was 10 years old . Got that kind of naughty feeling . Oh , yeah . Be quiet , Vic . Let her talk . When I was little , we weren't even allow to say "" Merry Christmas "" because it condoned drunkenness . It was "" Happy Christmas "" or it was the doghouse . Oh , I'm sorry , Carol . I wasn't thinking . Sorry . What , because Bob was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you know it wasn't Ernie's house ? Photos . Oh , no red hair , no freckles , no ugly cousins . ( LAUGHS ) No wobbegongs .

He cleaned up every mess Ernie ever made . No thanks , no recognition . And when Bob needed help , nothing . No ... nothing . Just a howl of disappointment . Disapproval . Yeah . No , no . I've heard the stories . VIC : Family's not a word , it's a sentence . Mmm ! Rubbish . It's a challenge . No ! It's an adventure . ( @both_laugh ) I think I 'd like another glass , Gail . Come on .

That's where Santa Claus lives . Is it ? My mother was a drunk . She lived on peanuts and gin . Whenever I wanted her to hug me .. I dragged her out of pubs after school , every day . Whenever I want her to hug me , she 'd crack open a peanut and she 'd say , "" Look , Carol . That's where Santa Claus lives . "" Don't give her any more to drink . GAIL : Well , excuse us , Constable ! ( @both_laugh ) CAROL : Oh , let's get him with a peanut . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - CAROL : Well done , Gail . - Hey ? - CAROL : Now it's on . Oh , yeah .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And often as not , they're just going off their rockers and ... drinking too much . They don't trust each other , they don't trust themselves and they leave their stuff with me . Why you ? Because I don't drink . Because I'm trustworthy . I have to see some people before I leave . In case there's any misunderstanding . Do you want me to drive you ? Well , it would be quicker . Yeah , just pull up here . Yep . I won't be long . Did you hear about the royal commission ? Somebody said it was on . You're not curious ? It was a long time ago . Shame to get this car dirty . I hear you're a lawyer now . Yeah . What kind ? Industrial relations . On whose side ? The little bloke . Oh , that's good . That's good . You've got ta look after the little bloke . Yeah , well , that's the theory . And your mother , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She's dying .

I wouldn't have gone drunk . - That's irrelevant . - I wouldn't have gone . It's not irrelevant to me . Well , Jesus , you've been sober for 15 years , any way it turns out . Waiting every day . Have you ever written to her ? - Not since I've been straight . - Why not ? Shame , I suppose . - I didn't want to get ... - She's married to you ! So I believe . It's good that you're sober .

I'm really sorry about that . I saw things . Well , I don't know . I half saw things . Things I didn't really understand at the time . I don't even really understand them now . It's just ... It was the surprise of it . Knowing that I was on the outside . As soon as I smelt that there was something crook , I knew there was no-one safe to tell . Nobody at all ? No , I thought I was going nuts . But then there was this little kid . He was a small-time petty crim . He had his legs broken out on Thunder Beach . Yeah , he got ... he hopped into a car with detectives ... Yeah , that's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know what it was about . Drugs , I s'pose . I never really understood it . It was just that he 'd fallen foul of them and any question about it , any witness account died on the vine . It didn't matter who it came to . It felt like whatever was going on , I was the only bloke not in on it . So who do you talk to ? Who do you trust ? I know it ate me alive . I should have quit . But I didn't even have the guts to do that . It would have saved us all a lot of pain . I just hung on in there until there was nothing left of me . There was nothing left of any of us . It was cowardice . It's not natural . You learn it . So , how did you get off the booze ? I went to a meeting in Kalgoorlie . Just the one ? Yeah . Only the one . I 'd had enough of self-pity . 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Called myself a yardman , but basically I was an alcoholic sweeping floors for drinks . Then I came up here with the dog and I hid . I think I was trying to work up the nerve to kill myself . There's plenty of mineshafts up here . No shortage of means . I spent months plotting and planning . I went mad , I s'pose . And then I realised I 'd been six months without a drink . I woke up one morning . It was winter . The sun was on this fallen tree , this dead , grey tree , and there was steam rising off the dead wood ... and I felt new . I had this feeling that the world was inviting me in and luring me towards ... something . I du n no . Life , I s'pose . I see you read a lot . Yep . It's an education . But my eyes are going .

( BIRDCAWSINDISTANCE ) ( @car_approaches ) ( CARRUMBLES ) ( RUMBLESGETLOUDER ) ( SILENCE ) ( BIRDSCHIRRUP ) WOMAN : The two detectives found his father on the bed . He 'd been dead for 10 days . Some say that he put a pillow over his dad's head ... and suffocated him . But that's just what they told me . BOY : Mum and Dad told me about an oldish man called Boner . He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him and he 'd shot himself underneath the chin but he survived that . He had half of his face blown off and he had a big hole in his neck , where his ... around where his voice box was . So every time he spoke , he had to put his finger into his mouth , into his neck , and that ... just so he could ... was able to speak . It was , like ... something like that . MAN : I reckon it must've been early high school and Boner was older than me . He wasn't really a mate . I didn't have any mates in those days . A mate was probably just someone who was a bit less of an arsehole than an enemy . And people used to just treat me like shit . They used to call me fucking ' Flathead ' and there was these two older cunts that used to just belt the fuck out of me every lesson . They thought it just was good fun . Anyway , one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in A-wing , down this long bloody corridor . I looked up and I saw these two bastards coming and ... and Boner was standing behind them and he was kneeing them in the backside as they walked along and whacking them in the back of the head and he was saying to ' em , "" You fucking leave him alone . "" You leave him alone . "" And he got to the end of the corridor and then he just fucking belted the shit out of them and he was saying , "" Leave the ... leave him alone , you fucking dogs . "" And no-one knew ... no-one except me knew why he was doing it . And he was standing up for me and yet ... he hardly knew me , really , and that was the first time anyone had ever really stood up for me . ( @engine_revs ) ( ENGINEROARS ) ( CARDRIVESAWAY ) MAN : Yeah , well , Boner was driving along one day and he had a whole heap of garbage on the front of his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked down to see what was going on . And there was a police car coming the other way . And he wandered across the road and pushed the police car off the road . Got down the road a bit , looked in the mirror and the police are chasing him . So he pulled up . The police said to him , "" You just run us off the road . "" He said , "" I didn't see you . "" He said , "" Well , that's pretty obvious you didn't see us . "" He said , "" You run us off the road . "" He said , "" We had to go out in the paddock there . "" He said , "" Look at the car . "" It's covered in grass and dirt and mud . "" What were you doing ? "" "" Oh , "" he said , "" what happened is ... I'm a snake catcher . "" I had a snake in a bag there . "" And he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs . "" He said , "" I bent down to pick him up "" and when I bent down , I must've wandered across the road . "" They said , "" Where's the snake ? "" He said , "" In the car . Do you want to he ! p me catch it ? "" He said to the police . They said , "" Nah , you're right , mate . Just go on your way . "" That's what ... ( LAUGHS ) He was a wild man . ( CHUCKLES ) MAN : I heard a bit about him but he was always in trouble . He was always in trouble with the police . He used to go to school and he got the cuts that many times , his hands and everything , that he decided that he wasn't going to get it anymore so he didn't do anything to the teacher but he just said , "" If you're gon na give me the strap again , "" ( LAUGHS ) "" you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about it . He was always in ... when were in school , he was always ... You know , he 'd be the one that's there ... baring his behind to the girls in the back . He 'd bend over and ... Well , he got expelled for that , so that was the end of him . ( ARCADEMUSICPLAYS ) ( @woman_laughs ) WOMAN : I ... I wasn't one of his molls . But , um , I remember how just going for one ride in his panel van would set you up with a reputation for the rest of your life . You didn't even really have to do anything with him , just be seen in his car . So , one day when I had to go the shops , I heard his car coming along and , um , started swinging my hips a little bit more . And he pulled up . And he only asked me where Jackie was , for God's sake , and I just said , "" Oh , I don't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking for a little while . A couple of ... Susie and Rachel went past in a car . I leant right in the car and sort of bent down and touched the gearstick and made out that , you know , I was inside the car , giving him a kiss . And then when they went past , he sort of drove off not long after and I told people that ... that I 'd fucked him , that I actually had sex with him that day . And I didn't .

( TWANGSGUITAR ) and their breasts . He was naked when they found him . They said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He had these shark jewels around his neck . His face was badly cut . No-one knew what he 'd done to himself . When the cops got there ... he just kept mumbling over and over again . "" You see that tree ? "" See that tree ? That's my mother's screamin ' neck .

Isn't this beautiful ? - You're taking the last of my children . - And the best . Don't be so modest , Johnny . Congratulations , Isabelle . Of course , this is a tremendous surprise for everybody . We've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , don't you put it off on my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That's great ! What is it , Pa ? I don't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards . Right ? Right . The happiest moment in a woman's life is when she feels for the first time her baby's arms around her neck . No word's fine enough to describe it ! And the pride and happiness to see him grow up . Whatever you do , don't let anyone rob you of the happiness of children . - It's the greatest consolation ... - Here they are , Ma ! Who seeks entrance here ?

Now children , I know you're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ain't New York , but it's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he's just got a natural sense of humour . - I'm so disappointed Phyllis couldn't come . - She sends you her love , Ma . I'll tell you all about it later . - I have a secret . - What ? What ?

That tells the story . - You old ... - Thanks for the booze . - They don't call in that . - You mean you find it out soon enough . Can't something be done about this before it's too late . Everybody makes mistakes , that's why the train stops at Reno . Don't say that . It may turn out alright . Pa should have had a circus . His family is full of clowns . You're wrong , darling , clowns are funny . Hello , everybody !

Imagine you and me , sitting on top of the world . Star light , star bright . First star I see tonight . I wish I may , I wish I might . Have this wish I wish tonight . - What are you wishing ? - If I tell you , it won't come true . On the level , do you like the ring ? Like it ? I'm as proud as I can be . How about the receipt ? Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I'll be in in just a minute , mother dear . I'll be over for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop you , step on it . Pa ! Johnny ! Johnny , you go on and get out of here . Go on home , go on ! Pa , what are you doing with the truck ? Johnny , I want you to get away from here . I don't want you to get in any trouble . Now , go on , go on home ! So that's the job you were talking about , eh ? Are you going to get out of here ? You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you can't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we couldn't do that . The stuff is here and they'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I'll unload the stuff . You go on home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything to happen to you . - That's alright , go on home . - I didn't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you needn't bother at all . Everything's all ready . Where's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben ! I'll show you where it is , come on . - Have a heart , have a heart ! - You , baby ! There are strawberries for dessert , you'll find them in the closet . - Good morning , Susan . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas , Thomas . - Did you sleep well ? - Like a top . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , grabbing my books and being off for school . And I wish you were just that little , so I can bundle you all off , give you your lunch pails and send you to school . - What would you think about that ? - That wouldn't be hard to take . Hurry and wash your face and hands , now breakfast is almost ready . Alright , Ma . What a delightful performance ! That old oaken bucket , that iron-bound bucket , that moss-covered bucket , that hangs , that hangs ... - Merry Christmas , Pa ! - The same to you , Susan . Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we're all having breakfast together . Ma , there weren't any more strowberries , so I got raspberries . Is that alright ? - That's perfectly alright , dear . - It's cold out here ! Good morning , Pa , and a great big Merry Christmas ! Ben ! Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there until Minnie and Isaac come with the children . I was just trying to see what Santa Claus put in my stocking . Ma , I wish they 'd hurry . Poor Ben is just starving to death . Well , I guess we won't wait any longer then . Ma , where's Johnny ? He was out late last night and he isn't up yet . Johnny , breakfast is ready . We can't wait any longer . Now hurry along , son ! Come right along ! Well , Ben , you sit there and ... Susan sits there and ... Thomas ! Thomas ! - Alright , Ma . - Come , sit right here next to me . Come on , Pa ! Pa , will you please say grace ? Our Lord , we give thee ... Just in time , Isaac . - Good morning , Isaac . - Good morning . Pa , I want to speak to you . - What's Isaac so serious about ? - Something's happened . I hope it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It's Johnny . - Johnny ? What's happened to him ? - He isn't hurt ! - He's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I don't believe you ! I can't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I'll show you . - I'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It's only a small fine . It isn't even serious . An officer was shot ! That's serious , isn't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny wouldn't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he's not upstairs ! And his bed hasn't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny's been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? - Why don't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you've got ? - None , to speak of . It's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything's going to be alright . - She's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Can't you see ? There isn't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you're not trying to do a thing . Why don't you talk to the lawyer ? - I haven't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you're shielding someone . - You're crazy . - I can't understand it . Did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't pay for it , did it ? I'll take it back . - I'm sorry about that . - It doesn't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , doesn't it ? Johnny , I don't believe you did it ! I won't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There's no doubt about that . Of course , it wouldn't have been so bad , only they took the car and don't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Don't you gamble your future on me . Don't wait . There're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I don't want you to come here again . I don't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they've done it . They've convicted him . Three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We've got to do something . We've got to ! We can't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I couldn't tell him anything . I always say : "" As ye sow , so shall ye reap "" . You can keep them old bars . I don't want them where I'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ain't got enough juice around here . Where they're gon na take me , they're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let's go . I'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You can't go on like this . I've got to , it's killing me . I can't eat , I can't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for me . - I'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I'll be away won't mean a thing . I'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you don't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he isn't . You'll always love him , stand by him , won't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll be hungry . You're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it's awfully hard to realize that Pa's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why don't you go and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I couldn't bring myself to give up the old home . I don't mind working , I like it . Besides , it's good for me . You're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why don't you ? I couldn't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why didn't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That's just why I didn't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I'm full right up to here . I've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I haven't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you're crying . I can't help it . I don't know what's the matter with me . Johnny , you haven't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I'm wrong , but I've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You can't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , can't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why don't you say that in the first place ? - Don't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I've got some great plans . I've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It won't be any time at all before I'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That's the tough part of it . I don't know how to tell her . - Why can't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they wouldn't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered "" Jailbird "" . Johnny , you mustn't go . Don't you see ? I can't stay here . I'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma's getting old , Isaac . That's the tough part of it . Of course , I haven't made things any too easy for her . You haven't made the things too easy for any of us . It's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I'll send money for her every month . I'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Isn't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why didn't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac's been so worried about me , he thought it's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it's good to see you , Ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye . This is gon na be a full page ad for the world's greatest washing machine . You know , the old method in contrast with the new . I never thought I 'd stoop to this kind of work . It costs money to live in New York . All right , you can rest now , Ma . Answer the phone , will you , Ma ? Hello ? Just a moment , I'll see . - It's for Phyllis . - Call her , will you , Ma ? She's up in the roof with some girlfriends taking a sunbath . I'll call her . She wouldn't allow me up there . She says I'm too young . Phyllis ! Phyllis ! - What do you want ? - You're wanted on the telephone . How did you know I was over there ? Thomas told me you were up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You don't fool me , not for a minute . I'm on to you . Why , Phyllis ... I wouldn't ... You think I've done something wrong . Now , I suppose you think I've done something I shouldn't do , don't you ? Well , I haven't . I'll show you where you get off . I won't be spied upon by you or anybody else . I won't stand for it . - You're snooping , you're always snooping . - No , Phyllis , I wasn't . I know you want to cause trouble for me when you came here . - Well , you won't cause any more ! - Phyllis ! I don't care if you are his mother . He'll have to choose between you and me . If he wants you , all right , but he can't have us both . It's all right , Thomas , I don't mind at all . This is Phyllis's home and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young I felt just the same as she . Relatives are a nuisance . I feel terrible about this , Ma . No , Thomas , don't you worry at all . There's so much work for me to do with Susan . And I know Susan and Ben are anxious for me to visit them . - But are you sure you'll be all right ? - Of course I will , dear . - But she's my mother , Ben . - I know , but we can't do it . Why do you think we moved to this little apartment ? ' Cos we had to . We're losing money in the shop everyday . People aren't eating meat like they used to . Some of them go on a diet and don't eat meat at all . If this keeps up , I'll go broke . I've already had to fire the delivery boy . - She's willing to work . - She's too old to deliver meat . Where am I if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman like her . I like your Ma and I don't wan na be mean about it , but we've got to be sensible . Later on , if things break , business picks up , OK , gladly . - But ... where can she go , Ben ? - To Isaac's . He's got a big house , no trouble for him . Why should he pass the buck to us ? You let me handle it , I won't hurt her feelings . Give me that ! Pa , tell Isaac to give me the bike ! Junior ! Harry ! Pa ! Junior ! Now let her ride , let her ride . Let's go of her hair , stop ! I'm gon na take that bicycle away from both of you . We're not gon na have any more of that foolishness . Get in there . Get in there ! I'm tired and sick of it . That's all ! The Lord said "" Let there be peace "" and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "" Dear Ma , "" ... "" Your bad boy , Johnny "" . Isaac ! Yes , Minnie ? Isaac , look out the window . There she is . I told you she 'd be back . - It's always nice to get home , dear . - Yes , it is . I tell you we haven't got room for her . You know my sister Rose is coming on to help me put up my pickles in preserve . Ma can help you , she's willing to work . But you promised Rose she could come . She'll have to wait , it can't be helped . Besides , I like Ma's preserves better . But she's in the way . I won't have her , she makes me nervous . She's going to stay , that's all there is to it . She's going to stay , is she ? Didn't hear of anything from Johnny lately ? Shut up , you ! My back's against the wall , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you , grandma ! Where have you been ? - Isaac ! - Where have you been ? I've been to uncle Ben's and aunt Susan's house . How long are you going to stay , grandma ? - How long are you going to stay ? - I think I'll stay a long , long time , dear . - What did you get for us ? - What did I get for you ? Let's see if I bring something for you . - What is it ? - They're drops . The whole party is lost . Even the firm he works for have given up hope . That's all there is to it . That means she'll be on our hands for the rest of her life . Well , I won't stand it ! You promised my sister Rose she could come . Where are we gon na put her ? You don't expect me to throw my mother in the street , do you ? Well , there are places she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where . - At Isabelle's and her mother . Isabelle just begged her to come to live with them . Would she do it ? No , she has too much pride ! I might have been able to talk to her into it . Isabelle's aunt's died and they've gone there . Her and her pride ! Well , I'm sick of her ! There are a lot of old people at the County Poor House . You're a tax payer , you can get her in . She'll be a lot better off there than anywhere else . I'm entitled to some consideration , I work like a dog in this house . Will you stop nagging ! Where's Ma ? Sitting up there by that window waiting for her darling Johnny to come home . Enjoying the sunshine , Ma ? Yes , it's a nice day , isn't it ? Sunshine . Fresh air . Flowers , breeze . The best things in life are free . That's true . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed the poor farm . I was surprised . How attractive it is . And how peaceful and contented the old folks looked . It's a blessing for those alone in the world . I was thinking ... I bet you 'd like it . The change will do you good . It'll only be a little time till Johnny comes home . - He's not coming home . - How can you say that ? He's no good , that's what I say and ... Ma , I think you 'd better go . Isaac . It's Minnie . Ma , Minnie is funny . She's funny , she's peculiar . I'll ... do whatever you think is best . - Condition of health ? - Very well , thank you . Cause of attendance ? I don't think I understand . Why did you come here ? No one was really to blame , but I didn't have any other place to go . I see . All right . You'll come with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evil ... - Isaac ! Johnny ! He's here ! He's coming down the street . - Johnny ? - I tell you I saw him ! That's him . - Johnny ! - Hello , Minnie . - Isaac ! - Johnny , this is a surprise . - Where is Ma ? Isn't she here ? - Didn't you hear about it ? Hear about it ? Hear about what ? She is ... - You don't mean she's dead . - It wasn't our fault . We did our best for her , but she insisted . - Insisted ? Insisted on what ? - On going to the poor house . The poor house ? Ma in ... Isaac . You don't mean you let Ma ... go to the poor house ! Come on , Isaac , what have you done with that money I sent you for Ma ? - I'll stick you in the eye ! - What have you done with it ? Will somebody stop him ! What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rawlins ? - I don't know . Say , what's happening ? Somebody help me ! Somebody stop him ! Somebody stop him ! Stop him ! Help me ! To the poor house , and he's gon na go with me and get her even if I have to drag him every step of the way . Kick him on down ! Kick him on down , he's a nuisance , every lick of him . Oh , Lord !

' Course , I don't usually trust preachers with beautiful voices . They tend to think too highly of themselves . But then I heard your sermon about the Negroes , and I changed my mind . I thought this is either a man with a total disregard for his career , or else he's one of the bravest preachers I ever heard . Either way , he wasn't all full of himself . ( Vernon ) Well , I'm not sure my [wife] would completely agree with you on that . ( [chuckles] ) She must be a good woman . She is . Children ? Two boys , two girls . Good . You know , Reverend , I've been a member of that church for 87 years , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some good , some not so good . But they all fell into two groups . They were either priests , or they were prophets . The priests told us the comforting things we wanted to hear . The prophets challenged us with the difficult things we needed to hear .

That would be the town Recreational Committee , which meets the first Tuesday of every month . I have , Your Honor . I beg your pardon ? I have submitted that request to the Rec Committee , but since it never holds a quorum in its meetings , it can't vote on that request . Well , better luck next month . Mr . Mayor , the Rec Committee has not held a quorum since 1964 , which , not coincidentally , was the year of the Federal Civil Rights Act . But , that may be , but there's nothing that we can do about that . Actually , there is , Your Honor . Based on the town charter , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of longer than six months , then it's possible for this council - - to call for a vote . Neil ? He is correct , Your Honor . But only if there is a quorum present at the time the vote is called . [clears_throat] Your Honor and everybody , I'm sorry , but I forgot I need to leave early tonight . I'm afraid I have to leave early as well , Your Honor . Well , that leaves us without a quorum . Adjourned . How 'd it go ? What was that Frederick Douglass quote your father was always so fond of reciting ? Power concedes nothing ... Without a demand . Yeah , well , I demanded . The power just rolled right over me .

It's standing up to it , even when nobody else will . ( Dr.Proctor ) So essentially , the quality of our choices determine the quality of our lives . Which , translated , means you probably need to work a little harder . [whispering] Thank you . Dr . Proctor , my name is Reverend Vernon Tyson . Reverend Tyson . Please . I'm the pastor at the Oxford Methodist Church . I heard you preach last year at the North Carolina Council of Churches . You gave a magnificent speech . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wasn't the only reason you came to see me . So he said yes . And we'll get run out of town together . [chuckles] You might be right about that . Well , I think you're overreacting . I'm just saying there are people in this town who think that things have moved awfully fast in a very short time and maybe they should just - - slow down a bit . Well , if anybody bothered to ask the blacks in this town , they 'd tell you if things went any slower they 'd be going backward . At the very least don't you think you should've consulted with the Executive Committee before inviting him to speak ? Dr . Samuel Proctor is one of the leading educators in America . All the more embarrassing if you have to go back and tell him they won't let him preach . They ? Who is they ? You know full well who's they . They , who put bread on our table . [sigh] I know what I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll give me 24 hours notice to start packing . Bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies . [phone_ringing] May Your goodness and mercy be upon us and with those less fortunate . I n Your holy name . Amen . ( others ) Amen . No . I got it . Reverend Tyson . Oh , hello , John . Yes , as a matter of fact , we just sat down -- Yeah , sure , I 'd be happy to listen . I see . Un-huh . Well , I'm sorry you feel that way , but I'm afraid I can't do that . No . [phone_ringing] Reverend Tyson . ( @male_voice ) Is it true you invited a nigger to preach at our church ? Who is this ? ' Cause if it's true , you're gon na regret it . Who is this ? [dial_tone] [sigh] ( kids , [shouting] ) Fight ! Fight ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Tim Tyson ! What are you doing ? He called Daddy a nigger-lover . Your daddy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending him , Momma . I was trying not to be wicked . Wicked ? Daddy says the wickedest thing we can do is to do nothing . [sigh] Oh , honey . [ding] Dorothy . I came as soon as I heard . How's Joe ? He's gon na be okay . Thank God . Vernon ... he isn't gon na want to see you when he comes out . ( Martha ) Vernon ? ls that you ? Vernon ? Dick called . They scheduled an executive committee meeting tonight at 7:00 . What was I thinking , Martha ? Did I really believe I could change everything by myself ? You're not changing anything - - by yourself . I'm here . Stand your ground . Good evening , everyone . Reverend Tyson . Jack , Mr . Pink . Vernon . Dick . I'm assuming we're all here tonight because of my invitation to Dr . Samuel Proctor to speak this Sunday . Why would you do this , Vernon ? I got people coming into my store asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanting to know did we really invite a Negro preacher to stand in our pulpit ? And what did you tell them , Jack ? I told them they heard wrong . Ain't no Negro professor speaking in our church on Sunday . Oh , Jack , why in the hell would you say something like that ? ' Cause it's the truth , Thad ! Vernon , nobody's saying that it's perfect here , but we've got good relations with the Negro community . This might not be time to - - to stir things up . What time is a good time , Dick ? A year from now ? What , five years from now , Doug ? Does that sound about right ? Once your boys graduate high school ? Ten years from now ? Heck , this is starting to sound like work . Why don't we just leave it for the next generation to fix ? If this man speaks on Sunday , there will be a breach that will split this congregation . Is he worth tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can end this with one call , Vernon . Just call him and tell him don't come . We're living beneath a dam , gentlemen , a dam that's holding back 300 years of wrong . Now , you can say that dam ain't going to break all you want , but when the rains come and that dam bursts open and all that's bad comes flooding out , you won't have time to run for high ground . Now is the time . That's why I invited him . And that's why I'm not making that phone call . Well , that's all well and good , Vernon , but this is our church , and you don't have a right to do this . Well , actually , Jack , I do . And you gave it to me . This is the Methodist Book of Discipline . It defines the rules that govern our denomination . And it says - - "" the pastor of this church can determine the number and the nature of services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am still the pastor of this church . Now , if you see things differently , you give Bishop Grayson Tullis a phone call and you let him know . Otherwise , I have a job to do tomorrow , gentlemen . And I hope to see you all there . [organ_playing] Reverend Tyson ? You never asked me what I was going to speak about . No , sir . I didn't think that was my place . Thank you . Shall we face the lions ? [chuckles] I come to you today to talk about a problem of enormous magnitude . Something some of you would probably rather not hear about . But it is a subject that affects us . I am the president of North Carolina AT , a black university of approximately 4,000 -- I'll be right back . outstanding young men and women . Among our many fine accomplishments is our football program . The other day , my coach came in to see me . He told me that the finest running back he had ever seen is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brother both went to AT . But when my coach went down to recruit him , he say he ain't coming to AT . Said he's going to school over at Chapel Hill , says he's going to play for the Tarheels . They got the big school over there , big money , the big stadium , and he's going to play for them . Then my poor coach drove over to Kinston to see about this 300-pound offensive tackle they got at the Negro high school there . A fine young man , good grades , but he say he ain't coming to AT , either . That his mama wants him to play for N . C . State and wear the red and white of the Wolfpack . Well , when Coach finished , he looked at me defeated , and said , "" I'm sorry , but we're going to struggle "" next year on the football field and probably for years to come . "" I've never seen a sadder man . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" See , that's the problem with all this integration , Coach , that's just the price we're going to have to pay .

Further , I requested from him the assistance of State Troopers to help enforce this curfew . And most importantly , to restore a safe , secure , and law-abiding environment for the hearing tomorrow and for the trial in the months to come . All citizens my ass ! Damn right . That curfew ain't nothing but a No Niggers After Nightfall Act . ( several ) That's right . ( teacher ) You can have ... whatever you can take . ( student ) Yeah . That's right . Yeah , Mr . Chavis . But you can only keep - - what you can -- hold . That's right . We're gon na keep it ! Keep what , Darrel ? Beer ? Cigarettes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troopers are here ? Because you broke some windows and stole some groceries ? They're not . You want to know why they're here ? They're here because last night , when you hit those streets , you took something more valuable than you could ever imagine . Something our families have been fighting for for years . I'm talking about equality . And they're not going to let you keep it without a fight . I ain't giving it back . Me , neither . Good . Mr . Chavis ! Mr . Chavis , where you going ? What's going on ? Come on ! Please take a seat quickly and quietly . [gavel_pounds] [gavel_pounds] Proceed . I saw three men standing over Dickie . Can you identify those men ? Yes . Two of them are over there .

All those people who walked thought we were talking to the Governor . My girls rode all the way here . For what ? What ? Please , just get me out of here . Come on . Okay .

You told Willie Mae that we was going to meet with the Governor when you knew he wouldn't see us , didn't you ? I told her the truth . I told her I notified his office that we were coming . You let her and her girls ride on top of that fake coffin for 50 miles , knowing that meeting wasn't gon na happen . That don't bother you ? You think Dickie Marrow's murder is the worst civil rights lynching ever ? It doesn't even come close to the things I've seen . And you think her pain is any different from the pain of those other families ? Now , what's special about his death is that it gives us an opportunity to make things better . Who do you think I am ? I'm not Dr . King . I'm not one of his golden boys . I'm a stoker , man . You understand ? They send me in to the towns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m just a stoker . ( anchormanoverTV ) In Raleigh today , groups of blacks marched in protest over the killing of a Negro Oxford man last week . Governor Scott's refusal to meet with black leaders has reportedly angered many of the marchers . Local police in Oxford continue to claim that the situation there is under control .

I played with them . We had an instinctive love for the Negro race . ( crowd ) Black power ! My secretary is black . That should show you how I feel about them . I have heard the arguments that this community is too turbulent for a trial . But I do not feel they present an adequate reason for moving these proceedings . [all_talking_at_once] Does it concern you that only 9 of the 100 juror candidates examined for this trial were black ? No . Why would that concern me ? Because Warren County , from which the jury pool is drawn , is in fact more than 2/3 black . This is a fair and impartial jury . And it'll be a fair and impartial trial . Mr . Burgwyn , is the prosecution ready ? Yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson to the stand . The deceased had two serious fractures of the skull , one on the top of his head , the other on the back . He also had bruises and abrasions all over his body , both .41 0 and 12-gauge shotgun wounds on the backs of his legs , as well as a .22-caliber bullet wound in the center of his forehead . I 'd been hanging with the fellas in the shed at the old fish market . Suddenly I hear Dickie and a white man arguing . That's when I saw Mr . Teel come out the store with a shotgun . And what did you do ? I ran ! I mean , we all ran . I heard about two or three shots . And , uh , then I came back . I saw Larry Teel standing over Dickie with a shotgun . I - - yelled at him . "" Stop before you kill that boy . "" Finally , I heard the shot . Who was holding the rifle , Mrs . Downing ? Who was holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Larry Teel . I was on my way to find everybody when Willie and Jimmie and them flew by me . Then I heard a shotgun blast . And after they beat him , what happened ? There was one more shot . Sounded like a cap pistol . [gunshot] No further questions , Your Honor . Boo , have you ever been in any trouble ? Legal trouble ? Yeah . But I ain't on trial . What kind of trouble ? Stuff . Receiving stolen goods , breaking and entering ? That kind of stuff ? Yeah , but I ain't killed nobody . I'm sorry . I didn't say you did . Did you serve time for those crimes ? Yeah . In fact , you're on probation right now , isn't that correct ? Yeah . Mr . Chavis , do you see the man that fired the shot that killed Dickie Marrow ? Yes . Will you get up and go over and touch him ? Yeah , sure . Please . Touch him . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense ready , Mr . Watkins ? Yes , we are , Your Honor .

And then Larry told him , "" Don't be speaking to her like that . "" And then he came at Larry with a knife , and I screamed for help . ( LarryTeel ) He said , "" Hey , white girl . Hey , you bitch . "" I said , "" Don't talk to my [wife] like that . "" And he said , uh , "" Come on , I'm a soul brother . "" Then he pulled his knife on me . After he went down , what happened ?

No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking down at him on the ground . Did you recognize the other men ? It was happening so fast . The boy attacked me . And I ran after him -- Larry - - did you recognize the other men ? My father was there . I recognized his voice when he said , "" I'm gon na call an ambulance and the police . "" And what about the other man ? I didn't know who he was . ( anchormanoverTV ) ln a surprise move here Thursday , Larry Teel , son of a local barber , Robert Teel , took the witness stand in Granville County Superior Court and denied that he shot and killed a local Negro man . ( Watkins ) Were you holding the rifle ? ( Larry ) No , sir . ( Watkins ) Did you see who was holding it ? So tell me , Roger , one more time , what happened . I heard Judy call for help . I ran after my father . When I got to the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Did Larry Teel at any time that night have a gun in his hand ? No . Then how could that last shot have been fired ? Roger ? I was holding it . Someone bumped my shoulder , and the gun went off . [weeping] I didn't mean to kill anybody . It was an accident . No further questions , Your Honor . ( attorney ) lf this was an accident , why did you let your father and brother stand trial for first-degree murder ? ' Cause my lawyers told me not to say nothing . Do you mean to tell this jury that you let them sit in jail without the privilege of bond for three months , and didn't tell anybody that you shot this man or that it was an accident ? Your father and your brother were on trial for their lives ! For their lives ! And you have not set foot in this courtroom until today ! My attorney told me not to come . That boy lay on the ground begging for his life , helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kicking him . And did you beat him with the stock of that rifle , Roger ? His skull was fractured . Did you hit him with it ? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me . Who told you to say that ? Who told you to plead the Fifth Amendment ? My lawyers . Mr . Watkins . And did they tell you that all the witnesses had testified that Larry was holding the gun ? And that if you said that you shot the rifle and that it was an accident , that your father and brother might not have to go to prison ? I refuse to answer on the -- Your brother shot that boy , didn't he , Roger ? ! And you and your daddy helped kill him , didn't you ? They let you stay home with your [wife] and your baby . Now you're supposed to help them and say that you shot him because they know there isn't a witness anywhere that can testify to that effect . Nobody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can testify against you . But I'm sure they told you that , too , didn't they , Roger ? No further questions . [hubbub_of_voices] ( femalevoices ) Lieutenant Williams , why wasn't the third man indicted ? There was a third party mentioned from time to time during the investigation , but none of my witnesses were able to make a positive identification of a third person , and they all saw the defendant , Larry Teel , fire the fatal shot . [clears_throat] Three men beat Dickie Marrow while he helplessly begged for his life , more than a hundred feet off of their property . First they shot him as he was running away , and then , when he was flat on his back , they beat him , and they kicked him . And they stomped him and hit him in the head with a shotgun butt over and over . Then they put a bullet in his head , just like you or I would kill a snake , and they called it self-defense . Then , after the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of the imagination an act of self-defense , they came up with a new story . An accident . Or what they might call - - accidental self-defense . Of course , there is no such category , ladies and gentlemen , and nothing remotely like that happened . This case is one of the most serious cases ever to be tried in this state . And the outcome will affect events in this community , the state of North Carolina , and across the nation . We can not tell the world that we have one system of justice for Negroes and another for whites . We must face the truth and we must act upon it or be damned by our lies forever . [baby_crying] ( @female_voice ) Shh shh shh . [baby_gurgles_quietly] I - - I hear that baby cry , and I can't help but think about a little girl going to have to grow up now without knowing her father . And I can't help but hear that cry as a cry from Dickie Marrow , saying , "" Don't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world it was an accident . Please ! - Don't let them do that to me . "" And if you do , ladies and gentlemen , well , you may as well hang a wreath on the courthouse door on the way out , because you just as clearly say to the world that justice is dead - - in Granville County . [indistinct_music_on_jukebox] [sigh] What's your plan , Ben ? What's my plan ? M m-hmm . You mean for tomorrow ? The day after tomorrow . I haven't really thought about it . Why ? There's been a killing down in Louisiana . Young girl . They need a stoker down there . That's not what they need here anymore . After tomorrow ... they need a leader . The jury's coming back ! [excited_chatter] ( girl ) Hey ! [organ] ( judge ) Mr . Foreman , has the jury reached a unanimous verdict ? We have , Your Honor . [organ] [church_bell_tolling_slowly] Will the defendants please rise ? We , the members of the jury , unanimously find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [shouting] , poundingcontinues Let us pray .

Why ? [murmuring] No , not - - not - - not why did this happen , ' cause we know the answer to that . Yes , that's right . Why do we do what we do ? Every day in this town . ( man ) We know better . [chattering] Why do we watch movies at white-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter and exit through a side door ? Why do we spend our money in stores where blacks are only welcomed as customers and never as employees . That's right . That's right . And why do we put our money into banks that refuse to hire blacks except as janitors , and are loathe to give us loans for anything except automobiles . Why is there only one African-American on the police force and none on the fire department ? [indistinct] , grocery store workers -- Yet we make up 40% of the population of this county . Why ? Why do we do what we do every day in this town ? Fear ? Tradition ? No , that's not good enough , not anymore . Power concedes nothing without a demand , and we need to start demanding some things , people . And I'm not talking about sometime in the future , it's a change that needs to happen right now . Right now . Until that change comes , we need to take our money elsewhere . ( woman ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a lot of strength . The women held it together . Mostly , we shopped out of town . Went to Henderson . Yes . Durham . Durham . It took a while . About three months . Yeah , about three months . It worked . Because we took dollars away from here and took them somewhere else . Exactly . After the tobacco warehouses was destroyed , the tobacco market moved on down to Kinston . And everybody felt it , especially the white people . ( Vernon ) Dick ? What you doing out here ? Hey , Vernon . Vernon . Gray . C'm on in . Close the door , please . That's a right good-size hole you're digging there , brethren . Yeah . We're digging a hole big enough so we can bury every sorry sumbitch in Oxford . ( man ) Well , that's the stupidest damn thing I've ever heard of . Who's going to be left to cover us all up ?

We've been offered a new church in Wilmington . It's a good church , too . Some of the kids at my school said that you were the reason that everything happened . They said their parents are glad that you're gone . I imagine some of them'll be crowing about now , that's true .

[Clearing_throat] A company in new Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real steal . Seems interesting . Uh ... It's a good one . Look , bill , here's a small advance until I have time , to study it further . Don't worry , Frank . I'll trust you for the balance . Well , I'm sorry . I've got to run . I've got people in the office . No problem , Frankie . Frank ... You'll ... You'll like this . Psst . Psst . Psst . Psst . Lo ? Where are you going ? You have to leave . I'm working . Not anymore you're not . Here , look at this . Look , uh ... Please , be quiet . We need someone from security in the children's department . We can get out of here , you can pack it in . What are you talking about ? I can't quit . Come on . This way . Why ... why not ? Why not ? May I help you , sir ? I'm talking to my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my God ! You grab his head , I'll take his nose . It's paraldehyde , buddy boy . Come on . Down the hatch . It will stop the shakes . How is he , Dr . silkworth ? The contusions and bruises will heal . It's the other condition that alarms me . Condition ? His liver isn't cirrhotic , but it's badly swollen . He's in the early stages of delirium tremens , the shakes , and quite possibly he may have some brain damage . Brain damage . Oh , my God . I've seen a lot of men like bill . I've got a theory not too popular with my fellow doctors . Excessive drinking is a disease , an allergic addiction . It's got nothing to do with a lack of willpower or moral fiber . Some people can't be temperate drinkers . I told this to bill . What good is knowing it if he can't stop ? I know , but he has to . Otherwise , you're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he's to stay sane or alive . The way he's going , he can't last the year . I'm glad you're home . How are you feeling ? All right , I guess . Can I ask you something ? I guess I've been afraid . Does it have anything to do with me ? Your drinking ? No . It's not you . It's me . Why ? Why do you do it to yourself ? I've been standing here all afternoon asking myself the same question . Why ? I look out the window , and I watch all the normal people walking by . It's funny , I don't think I've ever felt really normal all my life , I mean , like other people . I feel differently somehow , like I don't quite measure up . Ever since I can remember I've had this feeling ... Deep down in my gut . Scared . I see people ... [Laughing] . At ease with each other . I'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't be accepted . And then ... Overseas , I found that a drink ... A few drinks makes me feel comfortable , like I always want to feel . It gives me courage ... To be with people , do things . To dream . The money , the success , the respect , it was all good for a while , but it never seems enough . I always want doubles of everything to make me feel alive , worthwhile inside . But then ... That all began to slip away . I feel cheated . Angry . Always so full of fear , so I drink ... More ... And it makes it ok for a while . I convince myself that things will turn around , tomorrow , soon , that I'll make it all up for you , but it only gets worse . I ... I keep promising you , others , myself , that's it , no more , going on the wagon . That's it ! And I think I mean it , but ... But the guilt ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror ... Or ... At you . Especially you . Especially at you . I've stopped believing in everything . People ... God ... Mysel ... myself . I know it sounds insane , Lois , but in spite of all this ... What I want right now more than anything else is another drink . Have a seat . Mr . partlin will be right with you . Thank you . I'm sorry I'm late . Thank you for coming . I don't think I could do this alone . I had no idea things had gotten this bad , Lois . When I stopped by to see you at the store last week ... You know I 'd do anything for bill ... And you . I only wish it wasn't this . I almost wound up in a place like this . You look so much better . How long have you been sober ? Almost four months . What's your secret ? How did you do it ? I got religion . Mrs . Wilson ? Yes . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr . Thatcher , a close friend of ours . May I show you our facilities ? This way , please . [Man_moaning] Don't be alarmed , Mrs . Wilson . He's not in real pain . More imagined than physical . Here , we can tell the difference . Alcoholics ... They imagine things , see things , if you know what I mean . Dr . silkworth tells me your husband has been drunk for more than three months . Does he still have bowel and bladder control ? Yes , of course . He's not ... Yes , certainly , Mrs . Wilson , but we have to ask , you understand . I wanted to show you our sun room . [Coughing] The admitting office will answer your questions about the legal procedures for committing your husband . I hope I've helped . You have . Thank you . Please forgive me , but I have a patient to see . Oh , you'll have to leave the way we came in . These doors are locked . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . If you've found something that works , you have to talk to him . One thing I've found , Lois , is you can't help somebody that doesn't want help . But you have to try . I know bill wants it . Please talk to him . Please . I will . I'll give him a call . [Doorbell_buzzes] [Buzz] Ebby . Ebby , come in . Come in . Let me take your hat . Sorry . I was , uh ... Just getting dressed when you phoned . Oh , out of the blue . God ! Ha ! How you been , ebby ? Huh ? Why haven't we heard from you ? I was in pretty bad shape . I guess didn't want anyone to see me ... Even you . Oh , a man on ... whom the sun never sets . Let's go get us a little pick-me-up . Boy . Sit down . We got a lot of catching up to do . Here we go . A little gin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can't drink gin ? I don't drink anything anymore . I gave it up . Come on , ebby . Come on . Just one little hooker . No . I found a way to stay sober , bill . Well , here's a toast ... To whatever it is you found ... And to old times , if that's ok with you . Bill ... Let me tell you about this ... So what's this thing you found , ebby ? Huh ? Dame ? No . Actually , it's a ... It's a form of religion . Oh , cripes . Well , I just finally threw in the towel . I hit bottom . I admitted I was licked . What brand of religion did you buy , ebby ? It's no special brand . It's called the Oxford group . We have meetings . We try to be absolutely honest with ourselves . We pray . You pray ? Yes , and we reach out to others . It keeps me sober and alive . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all those people . Ministers ... Priests ... I just can't swallow the way they peddle God . If you don't buy their God , then you choose your own . It begins by admitting that there's a power , whatever you want to call it , that's greater than ourselves . Now you listen to me , ebby . I know you're from an old family , but I didn't know you were on the guest list of the last supper . You might just think about it , bill . That's all . Can't hurt . I know you ... I know you mean well , ebby . You stay in touch , ok ? Bill ... If you ever need to talk ... Yeah . [Door_closes] Bill ? Are you home ? Is that you in there ? No . It's the crazy man you think you're gon na put away in some sanitarium . But ... but you're not going to . Not bill Wilson , you're not . Just ... Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who am I ? Who am I ? Don't you even recognize me anymore ? I'm Lois burnham Wilson , the wife of a helpless , hopeless , drunken sot , a selfish , sick alcoholic who's kept me imprisoned in this dismal sanitarium for more years than I care to remember . Who am I ? I am your nurse , your caretaker , your cleaning lady ! When all I ever wanted to be was your wife . I let you drag me down with you , deprive me of love , warmth , friendship , even common decency ! But I won't go on with it anymore . I can't ! If you want to die , die ! But I won't let you take me down with you . I want to live . I'm going to live . I'm ... I'm going to live ! [Sobbing] I'm going to live . I'm not ... I'm not crazy ! Not going to put me away . I'm not crazy . Not crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , man ! Why don't you watch where you're going ? You bum ! [Brakes_screech] [Horn_honks] Hey ! Get out of the street ! You want to get killed ? What's the matter with you ? You , too ! You don't know what you're talking about ! Hey . Hey , you ok , buddy ? I want ... I want to ... I ... I need to ... I ... I want ... No ... No ... Oh ... Oh ... Something happened . What is it ? All I remember is ... I was asleep ... And yet I wasn't . I had this terrible fear ... Sense of dread ... That I was ... Going out of my mind , dying . And yet I wouldn't let go ... Couldn't . And then ... How do I explain this ? The room was filled with light ... From out there . And I was at peace . A kind of comfort I have never known before . And then the light was gone ... But the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not another hallucination , the condition of a damaged brain . From the look of you , bill , right now , I 'd say no . But , well , I'm a man of science . I don't pretend to understand something like this . Whatever happened , hang on to it . It's so much better than what you had yesterday . Ahh ... I know I keep saying it , Lois , but I can't tell you how different I feel . I can taste again and feel and smell . I'm alive . Really alive . I haven't felt this way in years . You are different . I can tell . I called ebby this morning and told him . He understood . He said in order to keep it , I've got to share it . Gave me a lot to think about . Think about this . What about this ? Ha ha ha ! Watch your step . A little soup sound good now ? I'm still dizzy . Hey , ebby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent the past few days in bellevue . He could use a good meal . Take him in the kitchen . Make him feel at home , ok ? Eb ? His teeth are in his left front pocket . Where's Lois ? She's upstairs . I think she's pretty done in . You're not asleep yet . Good . Maybe we can talk a minute . Bring home another convert ? Yeah . I think this one's serious about not drinking , though . He's been through the mill and back again . That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about , lo . You still working and all and this added burden ... Cooking and cleaning after all these guys I bring home . I mean , it's a lot to ask , isn't it ? If it's what you really want to do ... How am I ever going to make things up to you ? You keep giving , and I keep taking . Maybe ... Maybe someday . I've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have , too . Bill ! Bill ! Bill , we need your help . That new guy's going berserk ! He's throwing things and threatening Al . I'll be right back . They need me , Lois . Let them handle their own problem for once . Go to your fool drunks . I should know by now who comes first . He's not the man you knew . He feels he has a mission . He finds drunks and tries to help them out . He brings them home . That can't be easy on you , Lois . Well , especially not now . Unfortunately , not one of them has remained sober ... Except bill , of course . And , well , I think he's getting pretty depressed about the whole thing . How long's he sober now ? Five months . That part must be great for you . I mean , really being together again . Yes , it's better , but ... Oh , it's not him . It's me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now it's not what I expected it would be . Is he working ? Does he need a job ? That's really why I came to see you . I thought if we could resume our lives ... Sort of a new beginning ... Well , some investors I know have a situation in akron . Something bill's good at ... A proxy battle . That sounds wonderful . Thank you . Maybe if you tell me I'll understand . I thought you 'd be grateful for this chance . It's a little late for gratitude , isn't it ? What do you mean ? My whole damn life ! Zero . Even these past five months ... Hauling bums to salvation . Where did it get me ? They're all still drunk . And me ? Well ... It wasn't a bad thing to do . What did it prove ? That you can stay sober . Sober ? What's sober ? All that proves is I'm still a drunk who doesn't drink . Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why don't you wait another day ? I can't wait another day ! The investors want me in akron tomorrow for the proxy fight . You're afraid I'll get drunk . It's written all over your face . Put your mind at rest . I didn't say that . Put your mind at rest ! I've had my last drink , Lois ! I'm not going back to it ... Ever . No . It's still going badly , Frank . I'm having trouble getting on the inside . These akron steel folk are pretty conservative . No , I can't say how much longer . Oh , I'll give it a few more days , but it doesn't look so hot right now . Yeah . Ok . Sure . You , too , Frank . Bye . Excuse me . I've got some time on my hands . I'm awaiting the outcome ... Well , anyway ... Are there any tours ? Anything to see in akron ? There's the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not much else , really . I suppose I could always go to a movie . The rialto's just down the street . Thank you . Sir , what's your pleasure ? Nickels . Can I have some nickels ? Nickels ? Sure . Yes , can I speak to the reverend Holland , please ? Yeah , I'll wait . Reverend Holland , I got your name off the ... Well , I'm a stranger in town . I'm a drunk , an alcoholic , and I need to talk to another drunk . Can you tell me where I could find one ? I know it sounds peculiar . No , no , I'm not drunk ! I said I have to talk to another drunk . Ah . Oh , oh . Well , thank you anyway . Is father John peestrock there , please ? When will he be back ? Thank you very much . "" Reverend Walter tunks . "" Thank you , reverend tunks , thank you . Yeah , 5 P.M . , the gatehouse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The name of the man I'm to meet is Robert Smith ? Dr . Robert Smith . Yes , I have it all . Thank you again . Wilson . Bill Wilson . I'm from New York , here in town on some business . I really appreciate reverend tunks and Mrs . seiberling getting us together like this . I'm not really feeling too well today , Mr . Williams . Bit of a headache . I told henrietta I couldn't spend too much time , but as an accommodation , I 'd ... Strange you should be a doctor . My father-in-law was a doctor . I don't mean to rush you , Mr . Williams , but ... Wilson . Wilson . Oh , I'm sorry , Mr . Wilson . Yes . The reverend tunks and henrietta are ... Good friends . They're caring people , and it's because of them that I ... Well . Look , I ... I've had more than my share of , uh , help , you might say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider my problem personal . I don't ask help from well-meaning strangers . Doctor , I'm a ... No , listen to me , Mr . Wilson . The best have tried their wares on me ... Medical men , psychiatrists , ministers . I've been prayed over and carved up more than a Christmas Turkey . So just what do you think a man like you could do for me ? Dr . Smith , I didn't come here to help you . I came here to help me . [Laughing] And on that occasion , I was so hung over I turned in three empty exam books and was summarily asked to leave medical school . [Knock_on_door] Oh , henrietta . I was only going to give this mug 15 minutes . But is it ok if we stay a while longer ? Of course . I'm in no hurry if Mr . Wilson isn't . Mr . Wilson , I can't thank you enough . We're just jawboning , Annie . That's all , nothing more . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for me . They mean well , but ... We got to do it for ourselves . Oh , I've tried that . Once I was on the wagon for two years , but I always came back to it . Then one day I stayed . I don't mean by ourselves . I mean for ourselves ... Together . You mean , two drunks helping each other ? Of course , I didn't want to admit it at the time , but I could actually see the light in his eyes . [Clock_chimes] Uh-oh . Good grief . I 'd better get Annie home before she flays me alive . Are you busy tomorrow ? Not too busy for this . It's what our lives have to be about from now on ... Staying off the booze . When I think about what I threw away ... 10 years ago , I was one of the best doctors in the state . I had a wonderful practice , I was respected by my peers . Now ... I know . Believe me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . The strangest feeling , yet a ... A calm , safe kind of feeling . You really understood . I like that . Sure this is ok with Anne ? Me in your spare room , the star boarder ? Anne is delighted . I'll bet the coffeepot's perking already . I'll tell Lois what happened , that we'll be here a while longer . I got it . Nah , you just lead the way . "" Smitty and I have discovered more together "" these past four weeks "" than I learned through my months of failure "" back in New York "" when I was trying to shove religion down the throats of those poor , confused , and unwilling drunks . "" He adds a few personal things . He says to give you his very best and he'll keep in touch . Keep in touch . I only heard from him one time since he's been out there . Ebby , what's wrong ? I know you miss bill . So do I . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I'm all right . Really , Lois , I'm fine . It's just one of those down days , I guess . It might work , bill . It never occurred to me to help others as a way of staying off it myself . But it can't be like my New York experience . I gathered up guys like these , dragged them home , lectured them , preached at them . A real Bible thumper . Here you go . Thanks . It just didn't work . Getting preached at would ruffle my feathers , too , even though I'm a believing man . Maybe that's the secret . Do just as you did with me ... Shared your booze experience . No preaching . Smitty , look . See ? That makes you realize that drunks care for each other . Drunk or sober , there is a bond . Buddies on the stormy sea of booze . We'll start with guys who are ready to admit they've had enough and help them find a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they are , where they're from , how much they make , none of that means a damn thing . And they shouldn't fear being found out . We've got to promise they'll be anonymous . Every drunk should feel like we do together ... Safe , secure . We haven't been at this very long , but it's working for us . How about we find someone else to try it out on ? I'm game . It's good to see you , Dr . Smith . How've you been ? Sober . I'm glad . You look very good . Mr . dotson's in room 1204 . He knows you're coming , but he's not in good shape . He struck a nurse the other night . He's vicious when he's drunk . Well , thanks for your help , Meg . Take care . Thank you . Hi . I'm Bob Smith . Bill dotson . Bill did you say ? My name's bill , too . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s also a drunk . We're both drunks . Alcoholics . I hit a nurse last night , a young woman . She was just trying to help . Well , we know how you feel . We've both done terrible things , things that ... That we're ashamed of . Would you like to get off it , bill , stop drinking ? If you think you could lick it all by yourself , stay dry the rest of your life , that would be great . We found we couldn't ... Not alone we couldn't . We think we can do it together . How long have you been dry ? About seven months now . A few weeks . You some kind of religious people ? No . We're just drunks like you . Well , we know you're not feeling too well . We 'd be happy to come back tomorrow and talk about it , you know , if you're ... Well , bill . Goodbye , bill . Goodbye , bill . I ... Hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow ? You bet . Ebby ! Thanks for coming to meet me . Have I got a lot to tell you . Let's grab a taxi . Ebby , something great happened in akron . It could be what we've been looking for . Come on . I'll tell you about it . Taxi ! [Horn_honks] [Honk] Ebby , you're drunk . No . No . I just don't feel so good . Why ? In heaven's name , why ? Be-because I ... I don't know . I guess I just felt that ... No . No . It's stupid . What ? Tell me . It used to be you and me . Practically all our lives , you and me . Then Lois told me about you and that Dr . Smith , about all that work you were doing with him , and it wasn't you and me anymore . That's not true ! If you 'd called , I would have been back . It'll always be you and me , pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober . Ha ! Well , I'm glad one of us made it . You'll make it , ebby . Look , we're going to start getting together , people like you and me . Having meetings . There's so much to do . I'll need your help . Yeah . That's ... That's not what I need right now . You ... you know what I need . No . Ebby , don't . Eb ... Ebby ! Ebby , no ! Ebby ! Still thinking about ebby ? I'm sorry , lo . This is my homecoming . I'm nuts to louse it up . Anything wrong ? You went out there for a few weeks and stayed four months . You came to visit . For a week . And I loved it , but akron isn't our home . It was something I needed to do . Tell me something . Now that you're sober , why are we drawing so much further apart ? It isn't just me . Be honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't know how I feel anymore . Can you say why ? Neither can I . It's strange . I used to think , being a drunk , that one day I 'd just quit , be rid of it , and then I 'd feel different , better . No more knots inside . What I know now is that I will never be rid of it , and I'll spend the rest of my life dealing with it , facing the truth about myself , and trying to make it better . When I saw ebby today , it made me realize that not drinking is the most important thing in my life . It's the only thing I really care about , can think about . Including our marriage ? I found out what I have to do not to drink . In my case , I have to be with other drunks . You tried that before . I'll try it again because I know now it really works . I don't know where that leads to , but it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s what I'm going to do ... Absolutely . You're right about this one-day-at-a-time stuff . Hell , after I broke my sixth pledge , I broke Barney Stein's jaw . Now he won't let me drink in his stinking poolroom anymore . He's doing you a big favor , arty . Look , I got three months now . My wife called me yesterday . She might want me back , being sober and all . Trouble is , one look at my mother-in-law , and I'll be drunk again . Not so , Mike . I have to believe that if bill here can stay sober , any of us can . Charley's right , Mike . If what Dr . Bob and I found can work for this drunk , it can work for anybody . By the way , the meetings in akron and Cleveland are getting bigger and bigger every day , much like our experience here in New York . Which brings me to a point . Hank and I found this building on 24th street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Lois happier , too . The only problem is there's going to be rents , expenses ... Maybe we ought to have dues . Some can't afford it . They could afford to drink . Some drunks get awful cheap when they sober up . Well , passing the basket's worked so far . Besides , things are looking up . The book I wrote with a lot of help from all of you about our a.A . Experience , how it works , is getting attention from the public and the press . Told you my promotions would pay off . Dr . Bob's coming next week for an interview that Hank set up with the Saturday evening post . [Applause] You're going to be big shots . Anonymous big shots , Artie . The writer's agreed to use only our first names . That's ok . We just hope it helps spread the word . Ok , is that it ? I guess that's it , except to say thanks for keeping me sober one more day . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can always make room . I need volunteers so Lois doesn't yell at bill . [Door_opens] Lo ? I was wondering where you were . I've been out walking since I left work . It's after 10:00 . Did a lot of walking ... And a lot of thinking . What about ? Us mostly ... And other things . Like what ? Like ... Will things ever be normal between us ? Will you ever get a regular job and come home at night for dinner ? Will we have a home ? We could be dispossessed with all the bills piling up . Will our lives ever be simple , balanced ... Like other people ? I don't know . Nor do you seem to care . I care , Lois . It's just that I could never go back to ... To the way it was . It may have had some satisfactions for you ... Wait . Wait . Are you ... Saying I wanted you drunk all those years , all that heartache ? Not consciously , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life . You stayed with that . You're saying that I wanted you drunk ? You ... You ... I can't believe this . Maybe I should start drinking . Then I 'd get the same consideration you give your alcoholic friends ! You being sober , it's what I prayed for , but I prayed that it would also include me . Maybe it never will . This story is wonderful . It'll carry the a.A . Message to so many people . Today the Saturday evening post , tomorrow time magazine . They called . They want to do a cover story . Can you beat that ? I thought only presidents and babe Ruth made the cover of time . You know ? Our plane has finally taken off . I think we should keep our feet planted firmly on the ground . Flap your wings a bit . You deserve it . Bill , you and I know from hard experience that the alcoholic has no tolerance for the limelight . That's why we harp on anonymity . Not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep our darn fool egos under control . It's that simple . That's what we've got to remember , Billy . Always keep it simple . Always . You bet . Just keep putting one foot in front of the other . One day at a time . Now , don't you keep Lois waiting . On your way . Goodbye , smitty . Goodbye , old friend . We've come a long way , haven't we , lo ? Who ever could've dreamed of all the things that have happened ? Well , you always wanted to be somebody . Now you are . Careful of my humility . Oh , what humility ? There , look at that . There is civilization in California . Just 26 more Miles . Good . We'll have time to bathe and eat . Shall we get some coffee ? Uh , yeah . We have time . Uh , howdy . Oh , hi . Welcome to our a.A . Group . I'm Zack . Just visiting ? Tourists , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From New York . This is my wife Lois . Hello . Lois . Pete , norene . I 'd like you to meet bill and his wife Lois . Bill w . How do you do ? Ellen . Yeah ? Bill and Lois . Hi , bill . Hi . Hi . Have you been around before ? Oh , no , they're just traveling through . Been in the program a while , bill ? You might say that . How long ? Well , since 1935 . 1935 ? I didn't know it went back that far . You must've known some early members . Matter of fact ... Yes , he did . I did . Back east ? In New York . Didn't it begin there ? Yes , that's where we ... No , it didn't , Pete . It was akron , Ohio . You sure ? Positive . We're glad to have you and your wife visiting . Get a seat now . The meeting's going to start . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats now . Please take a chair . Take your places . Well , before we close , if anyone has anything else they 'd like to share , now is the time . In that case , after a moment of silence , we'll close with the serenity prayer . [Raps_podium] God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , the courage to change the things I can , and the wisdom to know the difference . Keep coming back . It works . It works . That was a nice meeting . Hmm . [Insects_chirping] I love the west , little towns like this . What makes that noise , locusts ? I don't know . I don't know . Are you upset because they didn't recognize you ? No . Oh , maybe just a little bit . I'm going to get some coffee . Do you want some ? No , thanks , sweetheart . Cicadas . What ? Them insects . They're cicadas . Thanks . My name is bill . Fred . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some doubts . Well , I only come ' cause the missus walked out on me and took the kids . Says she ain't coming back unless I make an effort . You know , maybe this meeting wasn't enough for you . Could you use another one ? Just you and me . I want my kids back . It's like any journey , Fred . It begins with the first step . I thought you might like some anyway . Thanks , lo . Fred ? Yeah . I may be a while . Is this ok ? I'll be waiting back at the motel . Thanks , lo . I'll be there . I lost part of my family once long ago when I was drinking , and then after I got sober , I gained so much more back . How long have you been drinking ? Since I was 17 . That sounds about right . Yeah . Did it click the first time you had a drink ? Did it click ? Yeah . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yeah ... Been going downhill ever since that click . Yeah . But this is it , I mean ... My boys . How many boys you got ? I got two boys . Two boys . They're 6 and 9 . Oh , you're very lucky .

In the life of every civilization , every country , every nation and every person there are special places and special points of time - unusually important , crucial points . In my life this special moment , which I'll never forget , happened in Moscow , Russia , in the spring of 1992 , right after the fall of Communism . I came back to my native town after 17 years of forced separation . Moscow was in turmoil , so was I . Allow me to introduce myself : Alexander Greenberg . That spring I was turning 50 - time to gather stones . And it just so happened that at an International Congress on the "" structure of the universe "" was taking place in Moscow at the moment . I am an astrophysicist , so are most of the people important for me . My entire tiny little world was getting together in the city of my youth . So I've decided to come to the city to face my past and to reevaluate my life . At the point it seemed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Not only my own life but also life of all the other beings populating our planet . After lunch we will begin our regular sessions , but right now , before we take a break , we would like to show you a short film . This film is not a scientific film , but it does include some footage of our space research , as well as some visual references abstracted from the works of numerous astrophysicists . May we have the shades drawn , please . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Let me introduce to you the main characters of our story . That woman who keeps looking my way is Helen . She is my wife . Or , if you prefer , ex-wife . In any event , she is always threatening to leave me . I need a life . I need a real life before I am too old . What's so bad about our life ? You call this a life ? Right ! SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And sometimes she does leave , for a time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking seems to worry her . Well , she had never seen me drinking so much before . The creator of the film you are about to see , Jill Stratton , is with us today . Do you see the beautiful lady standing by the camera ? That is miss Stratton herself . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : "" The beautiful lady standing by the camera "" is my lover , Jill . Not that we're really lovers . Not now , anyway . Sasha , what's the matter ? I don't understand . Don't you ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And that is Natasha . In a way , she is also my lover . Ex . Go . Leave Russia . Your place is out there . What about you ? What about me ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Even though we are very old friends , our intimate relationship was brief . As for the past seventeen years , we not only haven't seen each other , but have not even corresponded . But I didn't correspond with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by darkness , I would like to read a brief passage from John Milton's "" Paradise Lost "" . In this passage , the angel Raphael is speaking to Adam and Eve . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The imposing gentleman at the podium , is my professor , Doctor Gross . I have not seen Henrich Gross for the past 17 years either . "" ... To ask or search I blame thee not ; for Heaven Is as the Book of God before thee set , Wherein to read his wondrous works , and learn His seasons , hours , or days , or months , or years . the rest from Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal , to move His laughter at their quaint opinions wide Hereafter , when they come to model Heaven , And calculate the stars . "" SASHA ( @voice_over ) : I remember one of my last meetings with Gross before I left Russia . Continue your cosmological research for God , and make the bomb - for Caesar . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of his choice kept calculating the stars for God and building bombs for the Caesars of our choice . In the past two decades , a microscopic flash of time , we have been able to reveal so many secrets of the Great Architect that we can not look at footage reflecting the results of this change without utter fascination . It is debatable how long the Great Architect can continue to conceal his secrets . If we may remind him of the old saying : "" He who laughs last laughs longest . "" SASHA ( @voice_over ) : As in the old days Gross was challenging God himself . I must admit , I was surprised to see how little he has changed . Perhaps he has discovered the fountain of youth . The city beyond the windows is my city , although until the commencement of our story I have been away from it for seventeen years . I was born in this city , and I lived here for many years . It is a living entity to me , so I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters of this film . And this is my planet - Earth . On the grand astrophysical scale , a place just as small and cozy as one's home town . Earth is also one of our characters . Ah , Home , Sweet Home . One does not choose one's homeland . Our Universe . The way we "" model heaven and calculate the stars "" on our computers . I have spent my whole life trying to understand what limits there are , and what lies beyond them . Striving to break through the Iron Curtain hung by God Himself . Why did you walk out on my film ? I have seen it many times before . Why did you walk out on your own film ? I have seen it too . You're trying to escape so you can keep getting drunk ? You promised to come help me at the studio . But you're shooting . I'm done for the day . Wait here , I'll tell Lynn to pack up alone . Sasha ? Sasha Greenberg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - Kostya Ruemin ! Remember ? It's a shame to forget your friends ! Let's get together ! My wife will make a good dinner . We'll have a good time . Excuse me . I am sorry . We haven't been introduced , but I know who you are . I need to discuss something with you . My name is Victor Krymsky . They're all are over him . I'm afraid he's going to drink himself into oblivion , and his speech is tomorrow . It's wonderful Sasha , how's tomorrow ? He said he 'd come to the studio with me . To help me negotiate to the Head of production . OK , if he's with you , he'll be fine . Okay , Sasha , let's go . Hello . My name is Victor Krymsky . I have a business proposal to discuss with Mister Greenberg . Sasha ! I heard you were here . I just dropped everything and here I am ! That's great ! That's great ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go . We'll miss the Head of production . I'm the president of cooperative "" Knowledge "" . Do you have a car ? I'll drive you . We would like to discuss the possibility of working with you . Excuse me , mister Greenberg is going to a very important meeting right now . Sasha , How's tomorrow ? I'm Lomova ! Asya Lomova ! Could I really have aged so much ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : This is my second day in Moscow . So far , I haven't managed to sleep a wink , or to have a single moment to myself . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Helen and I were met at the airport by my old friends Tolik and Natasha , and , also , Jill . Jill was already deep into her new environmental documentary project , so she came to Moscow earlier than last week in search of footage and co-producers . The whole gang is so excited ! Greenberg is coming ! He was the first we knew who emigrated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it is really happening . It seems as if all of Moscow has nothing else to talk about . Natasha was the prettiest girl in the entire physics department so , obviously , everybody gravitated towards her . Every holiday we would gather at her parents ' house . Each of us fell in love with her , more or less . Oh , It's rare for a woman to be studying physics . Especially one like you ... It was the same at Harvard . My parents are still alive , they remember you . They want to have a party Wednesday for the whole gang in honor of your visit . Like old times . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : When I left Moscow 17 years before this moment I had no inkling or even hope that I would come back here for a visit . Back then for the first time in decades , a door had been cracked open in the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain . Of all the soviet citizens some Jews were allowed to leave the country to supposedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were lucky and could leave , you 'd become "" an emigrant "" to those left behind . Officially this word sounded like "" An enemy of Russia "" . You would never be able to see your birthplace and your friends again . But recently , under "" Perestroika "" ( Restructuring ) my friends were permitted again to consider me their friend . ( @phone_rings ) Hello . It's for you . You've been traced , already . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The following day consisted of three dinners and four suppers . Everybody wanted to see the man returned from beyond . From where no one they knew had ever returned before . They wanted to see but strangely enough not to hear . They were no longer interested in the outside world . Too many things were happening in their own . They just elected the first president of Russia Boris Yeltsin and said good-bye to the father of "" Perestroika "" the president of disintegrated USSR Mikhail Gorbachev . Did you vote for Yeltsin ? Yes ... How could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator , he'll show you . You have a better alternative ? You fear there may be a civil war . Well , it's already here . Gorbachev was the greatest leader of our time ! Look at what he's done in Eastern Europe ! Gorbachev is the same as the rest , only weaker ! He couldn't revive the economy , he couldn't give freedom to the republics ! Gorbachev is a man of compromise , a politician without principle . He can not be trusted . I don't know why Americans are so fond of him ! Americans consider compromise a virtue . Anyway imagine if Gorbachev went ahead with his reforms without compromise , and we 'd have chaos . It seems to me we are on the verge of a collapse . Perestroika is dead ! Perestroika has just begun . Perestroika never had a chance . No one knows how to work anymore . Lazy , spoiled slaves , all of them ! Master . All day I waited for your call - it never came . Tried calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mohammed , Mohammed will come to the mountain . Give me a hug . Ahh . What's this ? ( @phone_rings ) Couldn't we just unplug it ? No , you're not in America . Telephones do not unplug here . That would create too much difficulty for those listening in . So , disciple ? Do you think you've won our argument ? Do you think the time has come for the rats to return from "" unexplored space "" ? They certainly think so and they get so exited . A human person has broken an "" iron curtain "" twice . Fourth and back ! This is an event . And , it is morning , and it is officially your birthday . Congratulations . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Gross was not your average Soviet physicist . He had come from America . He had participated in the creation of the nuclear bomb . America dropped this bomb on the Japanese . It was the age of McCarthyism Gross did not wish to serve the imperialist war mongers . In 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union . The "" free country "" at that time had twenty million of its citizens imprisoned in labor camps . Gross managed to avoid the labor camp only because the "" free country "" desperately needed those who knew how to build bombs . Of course , physicists did not defect from the Soviet Union . The borders of the "" free country "" were well guarded . After six months in the Soviet Union , Gross married his housekeeper - a virtually illiterate country woman . His colleagues were shocked by the marriage . But Gross lived with her for many years and always seemed perfectly satisfied with the union . Good coffee demands precise preparation . If , for example , you grind it electrically instead of manually , you will never achieve the proper aroma . Diogenes lived in a barrel . Why should one care where one lives ! I am convinced , however , that in his life there were certain elements of perfection . Perhaps he prepared an ideal coffee , or drank the best wine . To attain knowledge , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , however , periodically measure the quality of one's thought process against other paradigms of quality . Master , I've come to share a secret . I have applied for emigration . Psychologists at Harvard once conducted an experiment . They took some rats and placed them in a labyrinth with tunnels leading to various rooms . These rooms contained everything essential to rat happiness . There were rooms with food , rooms for sex . One of the tunnels led to a so-called "" unexplored space "" . The rats had no way of knowing what lay beyond this opening , since no rat ever returned from there . Still , fifteen percent of the rats would inevitably go into the "" unexplored space "" . They were terrified of it . They shook with fear . Their fur would stand on end , they would experience uncontrollable urine releases , they would howl - but , still , they would go . As it turns out both you and I belong to this fifteen percent . Except that in our case the Great Experimenter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side , calling the door connecting them "" unexplored space "" .. It so happens that the presence of rats from "" unexplored space "" does not change the magical number of fifteen percent and what we end up with is a perpetual exchange of urine-releasing bravadoes ... So , if they let you go , we will never see each other again ? Who can tell . Maybe you could visit me there . Or I could come here . I think not . Rats do not return from "" unexplored space "" . That's one of the givens of the experiment . Otherwise , how "" unexplored "" would it be ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Had it turned out that Gross was wrong ? Was I really now back in Moscow ? Was I really going in the car with my girl friend Jill to the State Film Studio to help her to negotiate with the Head of the Production , desperately desiring to get somewhere a sip of vodka , something that in Moscow I left 17 years ago was in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? What does all this madness about vodka mean ? Gorbachev started a war against Russian traditional alcoholism and now there is something which looks like limited prohibition . I have with me a famous American physicist . Good for Russians and bad for me . You should have called this morning , we could have got you a table . We can't do anything just now . We take reservations ten days in advance . I wish he 'd take us to the Studio already , and disappear . My friend ! The American doesn't wish to have a table at all . All he wants is a bottle of vodka . And he's willing to pay ten times your price . Well , that's normal . That's what everyone pays . It's funny . When I used to live here everybody couldn't manage without drinking but me . Now I am back and desperately need a drink , there's a vodka shortage . There you are . You can get anything in Moscow , it just takes know-how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint venture , we are guaranteed success . But I am not a businessman . We'll put together a group of Soviet scientists who'll generate scientific ideas for sale and develop ideas generated by American clients . We'll make lots of hard currency . Excuse me . Aren't we going to the studio ? The Head of production is expecting me there . He'll wait . His studio is not a private company like mine . It's a government agency - no one does any work there anyway . # They say our studio is not up to world's standards in terms of equipment . That is not so . Right now , for example , we're shooting ten films simultaneously . Take a look at this ! # I'm so pleased you've come to help your girl-friend , but , as you can see , it is not an interpreter she needs . I know enough English for that . It is a more delicate matter , She wants to do a co-production . Okay . Great . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary material . Fine . We'll get it for her , but not all of it . But something . But now she's asking to see our copyright to this material . What copyright ? I talked to every attorney in Moscow - no one knows whether we have this copyright or not . What's a copyright anyway ? Don't take it personal , but it's so difficult to work with Americans ! # Sex and Jews are our two most popular subjects today . Everyone wants to film what used to be forbidden . These Jewish looking actors never used to have any work - now they're all hot property . Everyone of them is under three or four contracts at once . They're the envy of all other actors . Unfortunately , I have to tell you that there is no mistake in our lists . You have not been accepted to the Physics/Math Department . But isn't there a law that says everyone graduating high school with a gold medal must be accepted without entrance examinations ? Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have enough courage to tell me the truth ! Sit down . You snotnose ! I am not the least bit afraid to tell you that you weren't accepted because you're a Jew . Because we have twice as many applicants like you - Jews with gold medals - than there are spots available at the University ! And even if I followed the law and turned this institution one hundred percent Jewish , there would still be no place for you , personally . I am prepared to take the examinations along with the other applicants . That I can not forbid you to do . May I answer right away , without preparation ? Are you sure you do not want to think over your answer first ? I got lucky . I pulled my favorite question . Well , what is that question ? The modern concept of the structure of the Universe . All right , then . Let's hear what you know about this . The modern concept of the structure of the Universe is based upon Einstein's general theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great October Revolution took place in our own country , another revolution also took place . Einstein claimed that all three of the space Dimensions were curved and that a spaceship travelling in the same direction for a long enough period of time would return to its point of origin . In 1922 , the Soviet mathematician Alexander Friedman offered another model . In his model , the Universe expands . Expansion began at a point . All of of today's models allow for an expanding Universe . Although I must add that not all scientists are pleased with this . I am not sure I like it either . The idea of the Universe appearing from nothing and perishing into collapse is somewhat unnerving to me . How is it possible ? Did the Universe begin at the point ? Did matter evolve from nothing ? What was there before the creation of the Universe ? Do you know , young man , that that particular question has already been answered ? Long before the birth of Albert Einstein . No , I didn't . By whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion , was there before the creation of the Universe ? In his opinion , before the creation of the Universe there was already a hell for those asking such questions . But you are a world-renowned physicist . So what ? There are no positions available at the University for head of project . Shiffman will not have me . He has already let too many Jews into his school , he's a Jew himself , he's afraid to let anyone else in . Logov has never let Jews in and is not about to start now and Sarkisian is far too poor . I will not be able to continue my research there . There really is no place for me to go . The only one who wants me is Burkov . So , where is the problem ? Go work for Burkov . He has plenty of money and you'll be able to continue your research . Burkov is making the bomb . And what of that ? Do you really believe that if you refuse to make it , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youth as well , the end result of which was that I helped build the bomb both here and over there . You can not stop progress , Sasha . There will always be someone willing to use scientific discovery to further causes of evil . What does that mean ? That science should be outlawed ? Do you think that if you don't work for Burkov now , some other Burkov in the future will not find a way to use your achievements for more efficient warfare ? Or something even worse ? If that's the case , why not just quit altogether ? I am only interested in the structure of the Universe . Why can't I be left alone to study it ? Be left alone - in Burkov's employ . Even Christ , that shining beacon of morality , preached to "" render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's "" . Continue your cosmological research for God , and make the bomb - for Caesar . ( @voice_over ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wandered the streets , saying goodbye to my beloved city . That summer in Moscow was hit with an unprecedented heat wave . The sidewalks practically melted under one's feet . The streets in Moscow were swirled in acrid smog . All around the city underground swamps were on fire . The "" refusniks "" would jokingly remark that the Egyptian plagues had begun . Applying for emigration was risky . One might never get permission to leave and be forced to remain in Russia an outlaw - "" a refusnik "" with your career and life ruined . Still I wasn't afraid . Somehow I was sure of my luck . Our committee reviewed your application to change your permanent place of residence to the country of Israel and decided that permission should not be granted . On what grounds ? On the grounds that you were involved in classified work . But the Institute where I worked was not classified . You can not know that . Our committee only can know which organizations are classified and which aren't . I suggest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in not less than three years . What will happen if I find work and in three years you again decide that it is classified ? Then you will again be refused . # The woman who works for me has all the footage you are looking for . She shot it herself , so there won't be any problem with the copyright . Let's go right now to the editing room in my church . In 15 minutes we are expected to be at the Congress banquet . Then you'll come to my place tomorrow first thing in the morning . Agree ? Ladies and gentlemen ! We have a very special guest with us today ! For those of you who don't know , he like many others , had to leave us during the years of stagnation . And he is the first of immigrants we knew , who has come back to visit us . It is Sasha Greenberg ! This is especially difficult for me , as you all know Greenberg is my pupil . But treason is treason . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts . I confess I should have exercised more foresight , I should have recognized Greenberg as a future traitor right away . I am guilty . I only hope never to repeat this mistake . We are proud of Sasha's success in America , his achievements are ours , for he is flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood . All the more joyous this day , when we can again be together . Sasha , come over to my house ! You can't refuse , I've already got a lamb ! Does anyone else want to say anything ? Comrades , comrades , what is happening here ? Greenberg wants to emigrate to Israel and professor Gross can find nothing better than to accuse him of treason ? ! Of course , we all know that Greenberg is a traitor . Our nation fed him , nourished Greenberg , spent money for his education , and now he wants to emigrate to Israel , to give his knowledge to our imperialistic enemies , to the enemies of the all progressive humankind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow this ! Greenberg's place is not Israel , it's prison ! What do you think about that ? You , Tolik Gurov ! You used to be his friend ! Come up here ! Tell us what you think ! This is true . Sasha was my friend ... I am sorry ... Who could have known ? Who could have guessed ? I will try to not have friends again ... I mean , such friends . This is better , with the water . In case it's bugged . You're not mad at me , are you ? He just left me no choice . It doesn't matter what I say . You're leaving anyway . I'm the one who has to stay here ... Maybe I should leave too ? What do you think ? Just because Galileo publicly denied his beliefs , the Earth did not stop orbiting the Sun . It is all , like Hamlet said , words , words , words . Thanks . For what ? For being the only one to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright . It's just a ritual , anyway . No one really thinks like that . Yeah . Right . Want to come over ? I have some vodka ... OK ? Let's go . No shame ! No shame at all ! Now they're bringing men to the rooms ... Oh , wait till I call the police . Don't pay any attention . She's totally harmless . You know , I was in love with you our freshmen year . I suspected it . Why didn't you say something ? Everybody was in love with you . Swarms of Casanovas ... I was too shy . Shall we drink to your departure , yeah ? It's a little strange - everybody wanted to be with you and you're still not married . Yeah , I'm too picky . Why aren't you married ? I guess I'm too picky also . To the picky one's . You may stay here , if you want . It's hard to believe you're leaving us . We'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It's a strange word ... Never . It's not definite yet . I'm the first PhD physicist to apply for emigration . They may not let me out . Oh , you will leave . And a good thing too . You'll be happy there ... Just don't try being noble right now and asking me to marry you so we could leave together . My life's already planned out . I'll never make a good wife , I'm afraid . I can't serve astrophysics and a man too at the same time . I would like to have a baby , though ... and I think sometimes : what if I pick one of you guys , one of the best , and get pregnant . I would hide it from the father , of course . It's easier to care for a child without having to care for a man too , huh ? So , there is theory in your solitude . Well , then , in mine too . I have thought of leaving many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve thought of defecting even . What would I do with a wife ? It's just pure luck for me that emigration started when it did ... What ? Oh , are you afraid I'm going to try and get pregnant right now ? Don't worry . Not tonight . Do you like her ? She is my daughter . You see , I did it . I had a child and I raised her without a husband . I had this certain plan . Sasha knew about it . Doesn't her father know he has a daughter ? I didn't tell him . And her ? I didn't tell her either . Once , when she got especially persistent , I told her she couldn't meet him anyway . She wanted to know why . I said , "" because he is an American "" . She got stuck on the idea , she tells everyone her father is an American , she speaks to everybody in English ... So it goes . Is he actually American ? In a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Elena . Elena , as you know , Sasha is my old friend . Mom has told me lots about you . And not just Mom . You're sort of a legend around here . To my surprise , I am discovering this for myself . As well as some other things . Why did you name her Elena ? Why not ? I see you've met my namesake . We've become quite good friends in the past few days . I don't have any friends ! I'm sorry . Don't take it personally . I really don't have any friends . Why don't you have friends , Elena ? Do you ? As a matter of fact , yes . That's just because you're American . Around here , we don't do that . What nonsense you're saying ! Don't you know how many friends I have ? I know . That's why I said it . She's so difficult lately . Adolescence , you know . Comrades ! Comrades ! Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend we are greeting today after years of separation ! There is another person , well known to most of you here , whom we haven't seen in just as many years as Sasha . Friends , let us drink to the ever beautiful Helen of Troy ! # Excuse me , are you ... Helen Preston ? Yes , yes I am . You called ... Asked me to come ... Here I am . I am Sasha Greenberg . Of course ! Of course ! You're the famous Greenberg ! Famous ? How ? The first physicist refusenik . The freedom fighter . So , you came over from America on an exchange program ? Citizen , you are violating laws here . Let's see your pass ! You've been fired from this institute . You should've turned in your pass a long time ago . I'll be leaving in a few minutes . What few minutes ? Chromov , Come on , take his other arm ! Sasha ! This is a serious offense . This is a scientific facility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comrade called and informed us . Otherwise , we 'd be taking the heat for this . Is that the spy ? Let's have him ! Sasha , I will be behind you . You're Greenberg ? I am . You can go . Why was I detained ? Why don't you ask your buddies at the institute . Suddenly , there's this racket - spy , spy , spy ! The director of the institute says "" he's no spy "" . So go on , get out of here before someone else gives an opinion ! Oh , thank God , it's you ! I called the embassy , I called Gross . I guess Gross he must have got through to them . Thanks . Did you know this could happen if you showed up ? I didn't entirely discount the possibility . So why did you come ? You asked me to . Until the end of last century , Moscow was a completely unique city . All green and white , yellow and gold . Hills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with green roofs drowning in the gardens , golden domes crowning churches and cathedrals .. So , you were saying that your experiments support my hypothesis ? Now , if gamma is less than one you must increase the mass by a factor of two . Right . But gamma is more than one in this case . Can we see your house from here ? My house ? Ah , it's over there . You see the yellow high-rises right behind there . Let's go there ? God , I've never felt so happy . Happy Birthday ! You gon na let me in ? Of course ... Come in , I didn't invite anyone . Didn't plan anything . Thanks for remembering . You're not supposed to invite anyone . A birthday party should only be for those who remember . You think anyone remembers me now ? We'll see about that . ( doorbell ) You see ! And you said no one would remember ! Oh , Sasha ! Happy birthday ! ( singing ) Sasha , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in private . Right now ? OK , go ahead . I want to make a toast ! Where's Natasha ? Where's Helen of Troy ? I'll get them . I want to tell you I'm in love with Sasha . I want everything to be in the open between us . Wonderful ! Why tell me , of all people ? Because I thought you were together . Sasha and I are old friends . If you mean sex , then , yes , we did sleep together ... once . You have my permission . Even if I were in love with him , maybe even he with me , I would still tell you to go ahead . Why ? Because Sasha's destiny is not with me . There is nothing I can do to help him , but you can . What about you ? Don't you wan na leave ? No , It's very hard for a woman to attain any sort of position in science . I've achieved a lot here and Gross appreciates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Where the hell did everybody go ? I want to make a toast already . ( singing ) Your application is accepted . The trial period is three months . Come back in three months and we will marry you . Three months ! What do you mean , in three months ? Her visa expires in two weeks ! Couldn't you speed it up , in view of the circumstances ? Young man , we do not make exceptions or "" speed things up "" ! The law is the same for everybody ! I know their tricks . You won't be able to get a visa for longer than a month and we'll never be able to get married . Fine ! I'll contact the Senate . I'm going to get you out of here ! The American Senate ? What does it have to do with anything ? Everything . Sasha , this is Rabbi Katz , this is Sasha . Shalom . Shalom . The rabbi has kindly agreed to marry us . But you're not even Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not recognize a marriage performed by an American rabbi . But the American Senate will , and I think the American people will . And then we'll see what your authorities will have to say . ( MUSIC ) It was my mother's ... Who knows what's hidden inside this little figurine . Who is this ? That was my father . He was killed in 1945 . That's his last picture . Pictures of military uniforms are forbidden to leave the country . But it's from World War Two ! I don't make up the laws . You can leave it behind or I can cut it . Go ahead . Cut . Do you think you've outwitted the experimenters and returned from unexplored space ? I wasn't thinking that at all , Master . On the contrary , you were right all along : one does not return from unexplored space . I have merely made another pass into a new unexplored space . How long's it been since you've been here ? Seventeen years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I can't . They're gon na tell you how great everything has become , how things have changed . Don't believe them . Our lives are still pretty hard . You're a guest ? Go right ahead , I'm not even going to open it . Go on , your friends are waiting . Your labyrinth has changed so much , I can't keep a sense of reality . I have a persistent feeling I'm in a dream . Reality can get a little hazy when one consumes such vast amounts of alcohol . That's why I drink , partially , to regain a sense of reality . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Reality ! Obviously this word still had some clear meaning for Gross . As for me , all such words as reality , logic , sanity , time , place lost their sense a long time ago . It's amazing . Can I really live here ? Can you really be my wife ? I'm really your wife , and I have some news for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him ? Thank God . Where was he ? What happened ? Brenda lost the baby ! She found him . Yeah . Thank you . Thank you . I'm coming . I'm going to have to quit my job . If that's what you really want . I don't think I have a choice . I , I used to get so angry whenever people said women they only go to college to get husbands , but , maybe , they were right . Daddy has to stay home and work today and tomorrow too ... OK ? We'll play later . I have to work on the phone . Anything ? No , it's useless . There are no open positions anywhere . How about universities ? They are always looking for someone . Not all universities have the means and facilities I need to continue working on my model . So , now what ? I don't know . Hughes wants to hire me . He keeps calling back . He's got tons of money . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I had somewhere to emigrate then . Oh well , if it's a chance for you to keep working on your model , how can I say "" no "" ? By the way , he is paying triple of what I get now . I'm , I'm so tired . So much work in the house . God , if you only knew how much I hate you ! I hate your face , I hate your voice , I hate the air you breathe ! But most of all I hate that Universe of yours that consumes absolutely everything . It sucked away every single drop of my life ! I've had it . You go sacrifice somebody else's life for it . Just go ! Worship it . Go , go ! Fuck it for all I care ! Have fun ! I love you . You know that . Me ? ! You love me ? ! The only thing you worship is your Universe and your own mind . ( @phone_ringing ) Yes ? Yes , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . You're making a film about science . Your wife ? Umm ... maybe not . What does that mean ? It means that I am not sure . I am afraid I can't give you definite answers on everything , not even science . So , be forewarned . Scientific progress is a pretty ambiguous concept . After Hiroshima , it is very fashionable to give up science . It may have been a sixties ' cliche . But you didn't give up ? I know that and smoking and drinking are bad for me , but I haven't given them up . Besides , I've already mentioned an ambiguity , an uncertainty . Science has done a lot of good too . So , if I understand you correctly , that a science is much like the presence of your wife : a definite "" maybe "" . Agree ? Agree . What're you . Would you like to have dinner with me ? Maybe ... There is a certain ambiguity involved here , an uncertainty . And you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Universe is boundless . Imagine that on a small planet orbiting a tertiary star , one of billions of such stars in an insignificant galaxy , a group of microscopic creatures dares to grasp in their minds the entire extent of the Universe ! Let us drink to ourselves , friends , the most daring representatives of the daring race of humankind ! What's there to be proud of ? Man's a dirty animal ! The only species with the bent and ability to self-destruct , taking the rest of the planet with it ! I know , I know . Our atmosphere is polluted . Our waters are poisoned . Entire species of animals are being annihilated ! We are living on a bomb with the lit fuse , and still we dare to be proud of ourselves ! And all human family values and social traditions have collapsed . For real , do you have a wife or not ? In the past two years , she's left four times and come back three times . And why ? Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her to ... and , I guess , she does love me . Why 'd she leave ? She says I ruined her career . She was a scientist before I ... before she had the baby and quit work to stay home . You're a male chauvinist ? ! Bullshit ! I hate those labels ! For the past two years she's been working anyway . And before that she's always done what she's wanted . I've yet to see a married woman who does whatever she wants ! You two should get along splendidly . My God ! You're so beautiful ! Are you Helen ? Nice to meet you . I'm Jill . In eighteen years , he's never once said thank you for anything I've done ! What're you talking about ? Did you thank me every time I came home with a paycheck ? It's ridiculous . No , it's not . You earned your paycheck doing what you loved best ! What did I get for my work ? ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'re such a Male chauvinist ! I never asked for your sacrifices . You wanted me to give up my career ! To compromise all my principles and live on blood money you got for making bombs ! Nobody , absolutely nobody forced you into any of it ! Besides , if you want to talk about sacrifices , you should try eating one of your dinners ! I'm an astrophysicist Sasha . I'm not your cook ! So be an astrophysicist ! Nobody's stopping you . Professor , you know how much respect I have for you , but there is something I wish to steal . It is Sasha ? The very one . Will you permit me ? What can I do ? I can refuse you nothing . Thank you , professor . It's so stuffy in here . Let's go outside for a few minutes . Come on , let's go . We'll be back in a minute . It's right around here . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Moscow . The familiar city of my youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve been driving for half an hour . A whole half hour without alcohol . It might actually be good for your health . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : I hoped to find here the answers to the questions I am struggling with , instead I've got more questions . Will I manage to find answers to them ? And this is where we live these days . When my daughter was born , I applied for a new place . It took three years . You remember my old communal apartment - what a rough time I had with Elena there . Now we have two rooms . It's pretty far , but it's alright . The Metro is fast . Is Elena coming right back ? Uh uh . She is spending the night at her grandparents ' . There's your vodka . Is she my daughter ? What difference does it make ? What do you mean , what difference ? I want to know . Don't bother asking , I'm not going to tell you anyway . Let's drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait ... Don't say a word , Sasha . I am not blind , I have seen your harem of women . Look at me . Look at me . My body is just as good as twenty years ago . Aren't you happy I brought you here ? Tomorrow we'll dance the tango at my parents ' . You won't believe this . All the old records are still there . Nothing has changed at their house . Do you remember the old church next door ? The one that used to be all nailed up ? We used to sneak in at night ? It's being restored . It looks like new . We'll go there , I'll show you around . Mom ! It's me . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : This girl . She did not even exist when I left . Everyone hardly changed at all , but out of nowhere , as if out of sea foam - there she was . There was something mystical about that . Don't come in here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did you come back then ? It's my house too . It is . Now go to sleep , darling . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : All my days in Moscow I couldn't stop thinking about Elena and , look , here she was . Now she will move furniture all night long . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : The presence of this girl was definitely changing my perception of the world . Do you know how it is in science fiction , when you return from a trip to the past to find out you accidentally changed something ? Both your past and your present are no longer yours . They may seem the same at first glance , but you look closer and no - there is this girl . So , you inevitably start re-examining everything else , including yourself . We can not be the same , life can not go on as before . Good morning . Good morning . Although I am not sure it is morning yet . I've wanted to talk to you . Let's walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there to do around here at this time ? Oh , sure . In America , you can probably go to a cafe at three in the morning , at 5 in the morning , at 7 o'clock . Yes . I hate it ! I hate all of this . Because there aren't any cafes ? Because there isn't any life . Don't make jokes , sir . Do you think you're my father ? I don't really know . What do you think ? I don't know . But I don't think so . According to my papers , I am sixteen . Which means that you left at least six months before she got pregnant . Of course , she could've forged them . Who ? My mother . She can do anything . You're so harsh . I hate her . She is an old lying bitch . Well , obviously our perspectives are a little different . Want to know what I think of your mother ? Yeah . She's a lovely , talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to have a career in science , but to raise you as well . That's a miracle in itself . Through all this she's retained a youthful sense of romanticism . You call her a liar , but I 'd rather think of her as romantic . Because she lies ? Yeah ? We were talking about tomorrow . You know what she wants to do ? She was dreaming of showing me an old church . I'm sure . She takes all her men to that stupid church . She's been there a thousand times . You are cruel . You're cruel ! Don't you see ? If you loved her even a little bit , you wouldn't make her sound like such a saint . I don't think I understand . And what do you do understand ? I want to tell you about myself . I grew up under the portrait of a man I never met . He was a hero , they said . A man who wasn't afraid to apply for emigration when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to conquer the Universe . A genius . The new Einstein . Kiss me . Not like that . For real . Elena . You're supposed to know how to take a risk . This is my cab . Yours is the next one . See you tomorrow . Hi . Morning . Were you waiting for me ? Yeah . You want to get some sleep ? It's already morning . Why bother ? What do you want most of all right now ? Seriously ? Absolutely . An interesting question . There's no rush . Think about it . I 'd really like to see the house where I grew up . Something has definitely changed here . I can't believe this . We're finally alone . To think that , in this yard , I spent several thousand of my childhood days . I recognize it , but , at the same time , I don't . I have this strange feeling I'm going to wake up in New York any minute now . You know , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . Maybe I am sleeping ? Or losing my mind . The window has been bricked up . The building was remodeled five years ago . They were going to tear it down , but changed their minds . Stop , kike ! Stop . kike ! Stop kike ! Kike-take a hike ! We've got you now ! Ugh ! I smell garlic ! Ugh ! The kike stinks of garlic ! You're Sasha Greenberg , aren't you ? Yes , I am . I'm Volodya Listov . We've got you now , you dirty kike ! On your knees , kike ! Down , I said ! Do you recognize me ? We haven't seen each other in , what , since we were twelve or so , when you moved away . I recognized you , though . We used to be friends when we were kids . When we were little , we used to fight , of course , but kids are supposed to . Repeat after me : "" I am a dirty kike ... "" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stink . "" I am gross . "" I am gross . "" I am begging you to beat the shit out of me . "" I am begging you to beat me . Then we used to share a desk at school . I , a young pioneer of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , here , before my comrades , do solemnly swear to always uphold the ideals of Lenin and Stalin and to fight for Victory of Communism everywhere . To fight for the ideals of Lenin and Stalin . Be prepared ! Always prepared ! You're lucky you ran into me . I am the only one left of the old tenants . Everyone's been moved out to the new developments . The building's not the same , either . All the walls have been moved around . I can't even show you your old apartment - it doesn't exist anymore . I am the only one who could get a place here after they renovated . And that , um , only because it was mainly my efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to save buildings . Don't you know ? I'm a writer . Pretty famous too , in a way . Where do you live , What do you do ? I live in America . I'm in cosmology - that's a science about how the Universe works . Interesting stuff ! Do you want to come in for a while ? We can talk , have a drink over old times . I really don't think so . We're on a very tight schedule . We have to meet someone in a half hour . Krymsky . At his church . Then Sasha has to give his report . Krymsky , the millionaire ? I know him a little . If you don't mind , I 'd like to join you . Morning . Hello . Hello . Good morning . ( BANDPLAYING ) Ah , my worst enemy ! Good of you to join us ! What brings you here ? I've long been curious to see what you do here . You have an objection ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your magazine is just free publicity for us . ( BANDPLAYING ) You see , he calls me his worst enemy ! And he's not far from the truth . Why , of course , I am . Look ! He's turned God's house into a honky-tonk , for Christ's sake ! You people want me to be happy about it ? Would you prefer if it were still a warehouse for boots ? I didn't turn it into a warehouse . I would prefer it to still be a house of God . Him and his lot , you wait , they'll be calling me a reactionary and an anti-Semite . Well , if you want , I am a reactionary . Now they're poisoning our youth with this rock'n'roll crap . By "" they "" you mean Jews , of course ? You see , what did I tell you ? You know , there are Jews and there are Jews . ( BANDPLAYING ) I have friends who are Jews . A profiteer like him , who's Russian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jew profiteer . Anyway , nobody can deny that there's a disproportionately large amount of Jews in this new "" private sector "" . Just as there was in the revolution . And just who do you think made warehouses out of churches ? Jews are so overly sensitive to criticism . At Nuremberg they tried such critics ! Understand ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Yes , no doubt Russia of 1992 was drastically different from Russia prior to Perestroika . In the churches boot warehouses were replaced with freedom-loving rock singers , and Krimsky was running business activities which in the Russia I left were punishable by years of imprisonment or even execution by firing squads . So , what does your company really do ? Are you a scientific research facility , a film studio , or a rock theatre ? It's like a daisy flower - in the center is the main enterprise from which sprout separate ventures and petals . Our major petal I'll be showing you tomorrow . Site seeing tours of Moscow on "" troikas "" with gypsies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They're carriages drawn by three horses together . Very Russian . Very Russian . They're waiting for us in the editing room , ready to start , I believe . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : And now we were going to see footage , that not long ago was banned from any screening at all . So why didn't all these changes in Russia thrill me ? This is just raw footage . I understand you're gathering footage like that from all over the world . I'll comment as we go along . Every year Soviet factories release over sixty million tons of pollutants . In sixty-eight different industrial centers , the air pollution level exceeds the norm by 100 times . Twenty percent of Soviet citizens live in ecologically critical areas and another thirty five to forty percent in areas "" ecologically unsafe "" . This is about 175 million people - approximately eight times the population of Canada . The Black sea is overloaded with pollutants . Every year they dump 30 tons of mercury in there , not to mention about dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half million dolphins that used to live here not long ago , are now survived by only eighty thousand . The great Russian Volga river , it contains approximately 700 times the allowed con-centration of oil-industry wastes . Most of Soviet rivers are in much worse condition . A farmer passing by threw his cigarette butt in this river . Is anyone tired ? Should I stop ? These things aren't only happening in Russia . I 'd like to show you some of my footage . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : "" The time is out of joint "" - Shakespeare said it half a millennium ago and we are happily repeating it century after century and keep switching it out of joint endlessly . How long can it go on ? The planet life was healthier in the time of Shakespeare . And family life is definitely deteriorated since then . I hate you . I hate your face , I hate your voice , I hate the air you breathe . SASHA ( @voice_over ) : At least if I judge by mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen . It's crazy ! You told me you've never had sex like this before ! With anybody ! And I'll say it again . You said you couldn't live with Helen . I did . And she left you ? She did . Then marry me ... I'll stop making films if you want . I can be a really good wife . I'll make breakfast for you every morning . Want me to ? No . Why ? Because this is like a deja-vu ! Because I've been through this with Helen ! And the recurrence of this pattern scares the hell out of me . Helen and I have been through enough insanity . I don't want that for you . But I won't be like that . If you marry me you will . I know . Why ? Because the world's gone crazy ! Because the traditional family has crumbled and there's nothing left to replace it ! Everyone - women , nations , Soviet physicists - everyone wants freedom but , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my paper , I would like to say a few words . The world is changing at an incredible pace . When I was younger , scientists were the undisputed heroes of my time . The 19th century philosophy still prevailed , war , famine , and disease would all magically disappear if we could only educate people properly . The Biblical parable of Adam and Eve's banishment from the garden of Eden after eating forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge was reduced to a silly fairy tale . The very thought that knowledge could bring anything except absolute bliss was laughable . The curiosity that is the essential characteristic of every scientist was regarded as a moral virtue . It was referred to as "" sacred curiosity "" . My own professor , Doctor Heinrich Gross , would do everything in his power to instill this quality into his students . I do the same thing now , with my new students ! It is the only moral basis of humanity , the only thing that separates us from the animals , this sacred curiosity ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps that is why animals haven't tried to annihilate the human race , and humans , are even now , successfully ridding the planet of all animal life . My friends , tell me honestly , have you ever thought that man is the plague of the Universe ? God's punishment , an implement of death and destruction , something akin to a virus or a cancerous growth that exists only to destroy all life ? Demagogy ! Do not fear , Master , I am not calling for the banishment of science . I felt I had to say these words . Thank you for indulging me . ( CLAPPING ) Ah , let's now get down to business . How close is your model to a final understanding of the Universe ? I feel it's very close . Excuse me , I think I missed something : does your theory offer an immediate solution for any of today's problems ? I need a drink . You need some sleep . Do you really think I could sleep ? I need a drink first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably won't get it until tomorrow . Was I really that bad ? Everyone seemed to like it . I feel horrible . Get some sleep , Sasha . If I don't have a drink I'm going to throw up . I heard your parents are giving a party for Sasha this evening . Um um . Yes , they are . Are you expecting a lot of people ? A dozen or so ... We're going to have a trial run of our Moscow tours on troikas with gypsies right now , and I would like to invite your group . Sasha and Jill are coming . Thank you . I 'd also like to ask if you would invite us to your little gathering this evening . Eh . Thanks . Yeah . It was awful . Just awful . Sasha , you're a hero here and you want to be one . I guess you had to think of something to impress the little girl ! Now , why did you say that ? Supposedly , you brought me up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not make it worse ? Cut it out ! I am not your mother ! I'm not even your wife . Leave , then . Fine ! ( @knock_on_door ) Come in ! What happened to you ? The gypsies are waiting ! ( SINGING ) Stop here for one second . I see they just got a vodka delivery . What , are all these grandmothers alcoholics or something ? They get forty rubles a month pension . If you remember , we paid thirty for a bottle of vodka the other day . Tonight , each of them will sell a bottle and raise their standard of living almost twice . It's called survival . Forty rubles ! That's enough for one dinner at a restaurant ! With no drinks . But why would grandmothers go to restaurants anyway ? SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Aye , brave beautiful new world ! We are worrying about having too much freedom and the old ladies are fighting to survive on the monthly pension that can't buy one diner in a restaurant ! Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A month ago , they permitted selling at the Rizhsky Market , and now they're forbidding it again ! What are people supposed to do with all the goods they manufactured to sell there ? How's anyone going to make any money this way ? That's a weak government for you . Those helpless liberals don't know whether they're coming or going . If it were up to me , I 'd shut that Rizhsky Market down once and for all . It's a joke ! A fur hat costs three times my pension ! Who's going to buy it ? Only another speculator , like themselves ! So ! In a government store you 'd never even see a hat ! So , who needs hats anyway ! First it was the party bigwigs who went around in fur hats , now it's the speculators . It's never the plain folk . I don't care if I'm being exploited by Brezhnev or a speculator - it's all the same ! We need justice , equality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of Russia ! Wait a minute ! If you don't let anyone make the hats , you'll all be going around bareheaded ! Better without hats than without justice ! Where did you get that ? We'll spare no expense when it comes to our own flesh and blood ! You bought it at a private market . You can't get piglets at a government store . So let them grow pigs ! But not at these prices ! What prices ? ! They start from nothing ! If they don't survive , you'll never see any piglets at all ! During Stalin you could get piglets in the stores ! During Stalin twenty million were slaving away in labor camps ! And if you were ten minutes late for work they 'd put you away too ! At least there was order . You see ! I rest my case ! Chaos ! Disaster ! We're headed for civil war ! I must say , I don't envy Gorbachev . Trying to get this country to budge . You've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . What's that supposed to mean ? We're going to set things straight . And who died and left you boss ? We don't need your blessing . As soon as these liberals bring the country to complete collapse , it will fall into our hands , like a ripe fruit . May I have this dance ? I can't dance to this . Oh , it's simple . Come , come , I'll show you . Come . What is the reason for all this gloom ? It's all so boring . All these stupid arguments and now this ridiculous tango . You can leave if you're bored . No one's keeping you from being with kids your own age . Kids my own age ! What a joke ! Professor , you're a wise man . Tell me , why is it all so awful ? Why is everybody so mean ? Whenever I tell someone I want to go to America , they tell "" it's no better over there "" ! Like they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s play , the three sisters want to get away from the boonies , they keep saying "" we want to go to Moscow "" , and in the whole play there's no villain mean enough to tell them "" it sucks there too "" . Happiness is not found in Moscow or New York . It's here . You just need time to find it . Have you ? I have . Want to go see the old church ? What's the matter ? My mother's interest in architecture is amazing ! She has just invited Greenberg to see an old church ! A church ! What church ? Where is it ? That's right ! There's a famous old church near here . Let's all go see it together ! SASHA ( @voice_over ) : Many years past since this glorious morning in Moscow , but I still remember it as it happened only yesterday . You seem troubled , my man . What have you to be troubled about ? Master , life has somehow lost much of its luster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much similar to adolescence . It's a troubled time . Difficult . But It will pass . You'll get over it . Everyone does . I feel like my mid-life crisis is also happening to Russia , to America , to the whole human race . And if you believe the theory that man is a reflection of the Universe , than , it's also happening to the Universe . I don't understand this world , this life . There's a story , of a woman who asked Thomas Alva Edison to explain electricity because she did not understand it . He answered , that he didn't understand it either and told her to "" Just use it ! "" Here it is called "" perestroika "" - the restructuring . Although some people seem to think it's a complete collapse , an end . If you look at the film Jill is making you 'd think the whole planet was doomed for sure . You tell me it's only a phase , that I'm going through a "" restructuring "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ending . Adolescents feel that way . Some of them even go so far as to actually commit suicide . But there are few of those . Most restructure and survive . Look at Elena . How she suffers ! That's also a "" perestroika "" , of sorts . And it's not so bad . It's , in fact , what makes her so attractive . To you , for example . Master , I am old enough to be her father ! So what ? Why do you tell me all this ? To ease your conscience about your attraction to Elena . It's not so easy ! It's quite possible , you know , that she is my daughter . No , she is not . What makes you so sure ? Because she is my daughter . My loss , your luck . Enjoying the architecture ? There is something interesting I can show you , even my mother doesn't know about it . Interested ? Let's go . I come up here a lot . At dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Professor Gross told me that happiness must be found within oneself . Do you agree ? I guess . Did you find it ? I'm afraid not . Why not ? I don't know . Maybe it's my fault . Sometimes it's like some outer force prevents it : how can I be happy when the world's gone mad and everything around me is collapsing . Is it the people ? Why they don't want to understand ? Why they don't want to hear ? Yes . They don't hear . Not you , not each other . Not themselves . Nobody listens . But we can make them hear ! Come on ! Help me ! You said you heard me !

The man is a firefighter , a bush cook , a Ranger , a tour guide and a whole lot of other things . He's my mom's boyfriend but every time there are arguments , he just takes off .

Juliet's a little bony for me . She was doing this thing when she was riding me ... with her hips , I don't know , but it fuckin ' hurt . Other than that she was pretty okay . If she gives me the clap ... I'll fuckin ' kill her . So ... what about you and Darcy ? What's the real scoop ? Once ... I really had this thing with the stars . I wanted to be an astronomer . from the Horses's Head Nebula . So I took this pup out for a walk -- This pup I was looking after ... You were looking after Darcy's puppy ? Yeah . We were friends then . Anyways , I couldn't see it that well because of the town's glare , so I took the pup out along - - along the backtrails towards where the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wasn't . Then I seen the meteors flashing as they hit the atmosphere . There was ever lots . Hundreds . I started hollering , I got so happy and excited that I put that puppy down too close to the huskies . By the time I saw ... that puppy was already chewed up . I mean ... they fuckin ' tore her up . Oh , shit . Last June , I saw him walking down the highway , ' cause his ride left him ' cause he was being an asshole . So , I go up , I say hi -- He just fuckin ' smokes me and I go down . And I lay there and I'm thinking , "" Guess we're even . "" But he just kept on fucking kicking me and kicking me , about his puppy and how I fucked everything up . I told my mom I just got rolled by a drunk . You know , you shoulda been even . Hey , bud . ... Hey . Kinda late , don't ya think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whoa , hey , hey , hey , buddy -- Jed ! Leave it ! somehow you step away from me . I can't get in . You won't let me in . Like I'm doing something wrong -- I'm doing the best that I can -- Well , why am I even here ? I came back for you . I came for Larry ! I didn't ask you to come - - ? Larry ! ? Come here , Larry ! Larry : No , dad ! ? ? ? Mr . Harrister : So as you see , the positioning of the organs within the body is very precise . It's like a blueprint for the body . One of the most amazing things about the organs , is that they operate without us even thinking about it - - ( laughing ) Focus ! And so now we've covered all of the organs . So , as a reminder the organs are the structure of the body , comprised of at least two tissues working together for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pray tell , organ am I pointing at ? Mr . Harrister -- That would be the organ that you're missing . ( studentslaughing ) Juliet : You know , there was this guy once , his name was Larry . in that mind of his but he kept it to himself . He played guitar . And one day this angel came down to see him of yours is great , we're really happy you found it , but could you like , spread it around a bit like the other musicians ? Come on ... And Larry just looked at them and said , "" those other musicians "" are looking for the right note . "" I already found mine . "" ? ? ? So , look at the chap , he's sprouting some fuzz , hm ? ( laughing ) Take it easy , eh ? So ... What happened in the Barrenlands ? Larry -- You said that you thought something happened . Jeez -- Where do I begin ? So I guess this , uh ... I guess this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her he was going out on the land to bring her some caribou or muskox . But he never came back . That woman , she went crazy waiting for her old man . Her six kids were starving . I guess she got tired of always hearing them ask , "" when's daddy coming home ? "" You know ... So one day she , uh ... she lost it . She took her kids to the edge of the lake . She pulled them into the water and she drowned ' em . The , uh ... So , you want to know what happened , right ? They found her husband . They found his body while I was up on Ranger patrol up in the tundra . He was dead . He really did go hunting for a caribou or muskox . But he died . I guess he was out hunting and he got charged . Killed by a muskox . Got him in the back with his horns , it pierced his heart and his lungs from behind . Hit him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . They were stuck together . That man must have bled to death . Muskox couldn't eat -- They died together . That woman killed her kids for nothing . ( @water_dripping ) ? ? Ahhhhh ! ? ? ( coughing ) Here , dude -- Listen , Lare -- I got ta teach you some moves . Yeah ? You better . Next time someone like Darcy gets to you , just remember it's three hits . You hittin ' them , ( laughing ) I'm serious - - and then ... the ambulance hits ninety -- All right - - Okay -- Come at me - - Gim me your hand -- With your hand on my chest -- Ugh ! Lare , come on - - You're supposed to block it . Wan na know what is embarassing ? That muskrat mouth . Time for a shave there -- Juliet will be here in a bit . Maybe she'll bring a friend . Go to the bathroom and shave that fuzz off your lip . Sometimes your shirt slips down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well what ? Larry , man , what the hell happened to you ? I was born this way . Lemme see that neck -- Those are fucking burn marks , Larry . I had an accident . Yeah , I guess you had an accident . When was this ? Why is Darcy teasing you with fire ? Well ? What the fuck happened to you , man ? ! I got kissed by the devil , man . They're fucking hickeys ! ? ? ? Hey , Donny , what are you doing ? What does it look like , chief ? ? ? What's up , Dog-lick ? Were you pushin ' or pulling ' in there ? ? I said were you pushing or pulling in there ? WHACK ! Lare ! WHACK-WHACK WHACK ! WHACK ! Holy shit , Larry . If you were Mexican , you 'd be Rocky . Yeah , man -- You didn't have to do that though . You totally busted his nose . You owe me for wiping up the blood , by the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids and gum in your hair . What's your point ? My point , dick-smack , is you got purple eyelids and gum in your hair . Shit . Classy . Real classy . You really did it , buddy . Now , you're in . And now you really got to learn the rules of fighting . Next time you're at a party and someone wants to fight , they might grab you . Well -- You are fair game now . If you get into a fight and you get hurt bad - - just stay down . You stay down and you cover your head . And the person you're fighting's gon na take that as a surrender . It works 99% of the time . If they're drunk , you run your Indian ass the hell out of there . ' Cause drunks like to keep kicking . I know . Larry ? Jed took off again , didn't he ? He was called up north . What calls him up north ? Why won't you marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuckin ' freak -- Psycho fuckin ' Larry ! Guys - - Guys , what's happening ? Darcy told everyone what happened before you came to Simmer . He said that you burned your dad . ? Is this true , Larry ? ? ? ? ( @phone_ringing ) No , he didn't come back home . I tried everywhere , no one's seen him , no one's saying anything . ? ? ? WHACK ! No , dad ! ? Ahhhhhh ! Ahhhhh ! I'm your father , Larry ! ? Your my blood ! ? Ahhhhhh ! ? Ahhhhh ! ? Larry ! Larry ! Larry Sole ! Hey ... Hey , Larry ... Hey , what are you doing way out here , pal ? Huh ? Hey , little buddy . Everything's going to be all right . I wanted it to stop -- I didn't want anymore broken veins under my skin . I didn't want to see my mom all bruised up anymore . We both burned to death that night . Except I'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ... to just walk away . I can't go back . They all know about me . I can't face Juliet ... and Jonny . I've seen guys like Jonny before . They don't know how to love anyone . Hey , Jed -- 'Member the Dogrib story you told me ? The story of how our people came to be ? Yeah . ' Member those kids that made it back to the bag ? The one's that turned back to pups ? Yeah . What did the mother do with them ? She killed them , Larry . A person has maybe three chances in life to stare down the devil right in the eyeballs . This is your most important one . So , don't turn your back . Don't be scared . I would have done the same . ? ( crying ) I'm sorry , Larry - - ? ? ? ... I just said I was pretty good , I learned it up on patrol . ? Stay home , Lare . You don't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? Hey , Larry ! Hey -- Where's Johnny ? Mr . Hay River ? Who cares ! Juliet , I have to tell you something . You wan na dance ? ? DJ : Get crazy ! ? ? I have to ask you something . Okay . How does it feel to have the best ass in town ? ( laughing ) What ? I mean ... Do you wake up smiling , knowing that you break hearts with that ass ? Larry , really , when you think about it , what's an ass even for ? ? Oh , Larry . This is my favourite ! ? ? ? Let's go -- I got ta go get my jacket -- Okay . ? ? You got some guts comin ' here tonight . Listen , man , I'm sorry about your nose . I guess we're even now , eh ? ? WHACK ! WHACK ! Now , we're even . Come on , man , let's go - - ? Larry ? Hey , hang in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming . About what ? A long time ago . A mother said her boy died in a fire . She was so sad that she quit drinking . Became sober . But she became haunted . so she asked her straight out what had happened . So she told her . She said : I see my boy in fire . He wants to die but he's not dead . He's suffering , my boy , and it's all my fault . if her boy had any clothes that he loved ? The Medicine Woman told her that she must burn them . And she must tell her boy to sleep to rest and to die . She made the fire and her boy came . She was crying , she wailed . "" My boy , I'm so sorry . "" And she offered up his clothes to the fire ... and she told him to sleep . To rest , to die . And she never saw him again . ( crying ) ( crying ) Hey ... Shhhh ... . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is ... Juliet home ? She's grounded . ( @knocking_on_door ) What's up , Larry ? The old lady's not in , huh ? Can we talk ? So ... It's getting pretty cold out there , huh ? Yeah , skidoos will start coming out soon . You still got that Phazer ? Lare , I'm being sent to a group home for what I did to you . Just thought you should know that . Juliet is having a kid . Are you serious ? Do I look fucking serious ? She called me up , crying . Shit dude , the whole town knows . She's going to Edmonton . Tomorrow . She's gon na be living with her aunt . Does she want the kid ? Yeah , she says she fucking wants the kid . I don't know , fuck -- You gon na speak to Jonny fuckhead too ? Fuckin ' cock . Won't even speak to her . ... stupid piece of shit ! You ungrateful fucking brat ! Get the fuck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Jon ! Don't bring them back when you're done with them ! Says mother of the year ! What's going on ? Fuck -- Stupid kids ! You freak , man -- Can't talk , Lare -- Dad's here to pick us up . Where are you going ? Back to Hay River ? To Yellowknife . Jon , get in the truck ! What about Juliet ? For fuck's sake , Jon , get in the fucking truck ! What about her ? Jonny - - What about Juliet ? She fucks good . I'm just a kid , Lare -- For fuck's sakes ! Let's go ! Sol later . ? I'm sorry about the dance . I'm not . I knew Jonny was watching . I thought I 'd make him mad . I'm so sorry , Larry . I'm sorry Jonny didn't protect you . It was my fault . But , you can't just leave , Juliet . I want this baby , Larry . Babies , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like running hands over a jigsaw puzzle . How did you survive the fire ? I don't know . Juliet -- Mmhmm . I have this God-shaped hole in my heart . And I think you have one too . ? Larry , I have to go . Wait -- Jed told me once if a Dogrib woman cuts her hair , she has to burn it . If not , when she dies , she has to go back all through her life and pick up every single hair she 'd ever left behind . When Juliet dies , she 'd have to come back , and remember what happened between us , before flying to heaven . I don't know if I'll ever see Juliet or Jonny again -- And I cry for them both . I cry knowing that I don't belong to anyone . But I smile too . Knowing my life is still unwrapped . ? ?
