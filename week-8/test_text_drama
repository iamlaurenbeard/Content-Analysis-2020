The Historic Hall . Built , 1550 . Destroyed by fire , rebuilt 1732 . Restored , 1874 . It's very beautiful . Great Chapel . Built in the year 13 ... Sorry . Wilson , you're late . Yeah , but I'm not really late . I don't care . Three minutes late , Wilson . Cromwell's . Write it down tomorrow ? Today . Any boy late for the morning prayers is given Cromwell's , which is the word here for punishment . Why ? If you ask me why it's called "" Cromwell's , "" I'll say , "" ' Y ' is a crooked letter and you can't make it straight . "" - Quite . - Don't worry , sir . You'll soon get the hang of it . Mr . Gilbert , new master for next term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trouble with the alarm clock again , sir ? Morning , boys . Morning , sir . Announcements . The interhouse boat race was won by Ironsides . And we have to thank , for the excellent organization , Mr . Hunter . Tomorrow , 2:00 PM , cricket match . Scarffenel boys versus School First-11 . And tomorrow evening at 8:30 PM , concert by Small Choir from the library steps . Now , Prize Giving on Friday will be the earlier time of 9:00 AM . This is to enable Mr . Fletcher to reach London in order to join the NCC squad in preparation for their match against the Australians at Lords . Now , now , now , now , now . There's no need , no ... to get overexcited . There'll be tears before bedtime . Right . Now , as you know , Mr . Fletcher is giving up teaching to become a professional cricketer . Now , I'm sure you want to wish him well for the future at Prize Giving . Now , you'll also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr . Crocker-Harris is resigning because of ill health . He's been with us for 18 years . He's taking up less arduous duties at another school , and I'm sure we're all very , very sorry to lose him . And of course , we'll be sorry to lose his wife , also . She's been with us for 15 of those 18 years , and , uh , she's endeared herself to us all so much . Now , hymn number 555 , "" Lead Us Heavenly Father , Lead Us . "" Who do you think's the best left-arm baller in the country ? - You are ! - You are ! Oh , no , really , come on . Don't be ridiculous , come on . Move . Make way for Mr . Harris . I'll do it on the back . Where would you like it ? Just over there ? All right . Come on , sir , it's the end of term , sir . Oh , yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never promised . I never make promises to juvenile delinquents . You did , sir . You just want to see me blow myself up , don't you , you little monsters ? Frank . No . Excuse me , Frank . Good morning . I still need the details of your classes for next term . Oh , right , uh , sorry , Andrew . Um , could I get them to you today ? I 'd be obliged . Just the final piece of the jigsaw as it were . Would 12:00 at my house be convenient ? All right , listen . One more experiment , but if you let anybody know , I'll have your heads , you understand ? - Yeah ! - All right . - You're like policemen . - Sorry ? You get younger and younger . Laura Crocker-Harris . Tom Gilbert . I'm taking over from your husband . I know , you're going to be head of the new language department . Andrew , my husband , was only head of classical languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . Could you point to me Mr . Frank Hunter ? I'll do better than that . Follow me . Laura . Diana . Are we still going into town ? Uh , darling , I'll be right back . Ah , Laura . I'm going to miss your regular attendance in morning prayers . Well , thank you , Headmaster . I shall miss it , too . It's a nice way to start the day . And the library won't be the same without you . Well , well , well . Tell me , how is Andrew taking all this ? Well , I hope . Yes , thank you , Headmaster . He's , um , bearing up . That's sad . Very sad . Hey , Taplow , did you get your switch to science ? I don't know . I'm just going to ask . You work in the library ? Oh , just two days a week . Now , I have to seat parents . I 'd like you supervise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 Tannoys and ... Good morning , Laura . Hello , Laura . Excuse me for interrupting . This is , uh , Keith Rafferty , head of sciences ... frightfully important ... and Frank Hunter . Tom Gilbert . Andrew's successor . Hello . Hello . Hello , the headmaster asked me to show you to your room . If you don't mind . No , not at all . I hear you did a bit of rowing up at Oxford . Oh , God , another sportsman . The head loves them on the staff . I'm waiting to see who wins Wimbledon . We'll need somebody to take over from Frank in chemistry when he goes back to the colonies . Well , we must keep our bodies in shape , mustn't we ? Sir . Um , I was wondering if I could have a word with you . Certainly not . The bell's gone , it's too late . That's right . Cut along . Sir ? Cut along . Frank , you don't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't ? What ... What do we say ? We say , "" fuck off . "" And remember , don't bully the big boys . Pick on the little one's , it's safer . Good luck . Thank you . I should say hello to Mr . Crocker-Harris . Oh , um ... Listen , you can talk to him later , I mean , we don't want to keep the headmaster waiting . - Okay . - Come on , I'll show you where you're sleeping . Sir . Do I disturb you , sir ? Perhaps . I know the rules , sir , but it's very important to me . Have I ... ? Have I got my switch to upper fifth science , sir ? You have obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and certainly no more . And , Taplow , I shall expect you at the house for extra work at 12:15 , precisely . What is it ? I 'd fixed to play golf , sir . Well , then you must unfix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . You can't expect me to take money from your father under false pretenses . He won't mind , sir . I'm not sure I should take your word for that , Taplow . No , sir . The point is that we mind , don't we ? Yes , sir . We mind . 12:15 , extra work . And you're an exchange , I take it ? Yup . Just finished my first year . I'm here for three . Do you like it ? Yeah , it's a great place to teach . You just feel the history , the tradition . They put me up here when I first came for my interview . I didn't sleep a wink . The beds also date back to 1667 , I think . I'll be fine . It's only for two nights . Are you married ? Yes . Kids ? Yes , two . We'll all be here next term . Have you found a place to stay ? Yes , we're taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our classrooms are in this building . Go on , there , there . Up here , up here is the upper fifth science , where Mr . Hunter manufactures foul-smelling concoctions for his own perverted branch of learning . Well , not as perverted as the classics . Won't , uh , Mr . Gilbert be teaching the boys about rape and murder , incest ? Unworthy , Mr . Hunter . If you knew more about the classics , you scientists , you might be less keen to destroy this little planet of ours . Wasn't it Einstein who said , "" We don't understand science properly "" ? No , I believe he said , "" We don't know how to use it sensibly . "" Have a nice day , Mr . Gilbert . If only he had a little more discipline . Of course , he's an American , you know . Shit , he's coming . Now , boys , Mr . Crocker-Harris is not here yet ? No , sir . Six minutes to go , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson . How's your father ? Um , he's quite well , thank you , sir . But my name's Wilson , sir . Wilson , is it really ? But your father's all right just the same , is he ? Yes , thank you , sir . He's quite dried out now . Well , well . Now , boys , this is Mr . Gilbert . He's going to be the head of our new languages department . I trust those of you who will remain in this class next term will be as well behaved with Mr . Gilbert as I'm sure you were with Mr . Crocker-Harris . Good morning , boys . It might interest you to sit in on this period , Mister ... Mister ... Gilbert . ... Gilbert , yes ... Mr . Gilbert , and observe your future pupils in action . Yes , if I see him , I'll warn him . Thank you , sir . Pay attention to Mr . Gilbert , boys . He doesn't take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still report your misdoings to me today . I put 150 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide solution in this water bottle . Biggles , had a nosebleed this morning and was kind enough to donate this blood . So we'll just mix this with the hydrogen peroxide solution . Biggles , what do we got in this jar here ? Iron sulfate . That's right . Nick , could you tell me the chemical formula for iron sulfate ? FeSO4 , sir . That's very good . Now , hang on . Well ... now this has never happened before . Um , boys , I think you ought to just back off now . What do you got in your blood , Biggs ? Okay , boys , what do you want to do next ? You there . What do you want ? Piss off , Taplow . All right , knock it off . You tried to see me this morning . Yes , sir . Well , why are you following me around ? You with the CIA ? KGB ? MI-5 ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . What's your name , boy ? Taplow , sir . I'll be in your class next term if I get my switch . This isn't next term . This is this term . Vamoose . Get out of here . Taplow . What's the , uh , the chemical formula for ethanol ? C2H50H , sir . Rouse ! Get out of here ! Oy , Taplow . You'll know . What's up with the Crock ? Why's he being forced to retire ? There's nothing wrong with him . The head just wanted to give him the chop , that's all . I know exactly what it is . One night ... first time for about ten years ... he had it away with his wife , and it gave him a heart attack . That's you , I should think . No , it's not his heart . If there's anything wrong with him , it's probably piles . Of course , it's piles . It always gets ' em in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles . It's his heart . It can't be his heart . He hasn't got one . Right . Hitler's a sadist . Cut it out , boys . I'm not really interested . It is his heart , sir . I have extra lessons with him . Thank you . Sadists don't have hearts anyway . Are you going to be running special projects ? Yes , I believe so . Well , the fact is , we both want to start a magazine , and you allocate the funds , sir . Mr . Crocker-Harris is still in charge , isn't he ? So he should settle this . Well , sir , you see , Mr . Crocker-Harris always says no to anything new . I don't think he does hate people . I don't think he likes people , either . And he doesn't care whether people like him . Then I 'd say he hasn't a care in the world . "" You've obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us a chance ... "" ... no less , and certainly ... "" I think we 'd quite like him . And now , I won't tell you again . The fact is ... I feel sorry for him . Sorry for old Hitler ? You little ass crawler , Taplow ! Stop ... Stop it now ! That's enough ! Good morning , sir . I'm Gilbert . Good morning . Wilson . Sir ? Apparently you were late for chapel . Just a few seconds . I-I was in the library , and you can't hear the bell . No doubt you will recount those excuses to your housemaster . I fear I'm not interested in them . Sir . These are your Latin verses . Only one boy's efforts , Bullers ' , had any merit and that somewhat doubtful . The rest were mainly abominable . It seems to me that the best way of employing the first part of this period would be for all of you to attempt the verse again . And if you should find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may console yourselves , as good classicists , with the thought that , to amend an aphorism ... Taplow ? Yes , sir . You laughed at my little epigram . Yes , sir . I'm flattered at the obvious advance your Latin has made that you should so readily understand what the rest of the class did not . Perhaps you would be good enough to explain it to them so that they can share your pleasure . Come along , Taplow . Don't be so selfish as to keep a good joke to yourself . Tell the others . I didn't hear it properly , sir . You didn't hear it ? Indeed . Then why , may I ask , did you laugh ? Why did you laugh at what you did not hear ? Politeness , sir . I beg your pardon . Politeness , sir . Toujours la politesse . I'm touched , Taplow . But if you really wish to show me politeness , you will do so now by translating verses less appalling than the one's I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for him ? Finish now . As this is the , uh ... last time we shall meet as a class , it may not be amiss for me to say good-bye and wish you all the best of good fortune . And now the end of term treat . We will read a scene from the Agamemnon by Aeschylus . Agamemnon is perhaps the greatest play ever written . The scene I have selected starts with Clytaemnestra standing over the bodies of Agamemnon her husband and the prophetess Cassandra , both of whom she's just murdered . Very well , Laughton , begin . Uh , forgive me for interrupting , but I have the impression you understand nothing of what you're reading . No , sir . I ... Clytaemnestra has just committed murder . She is describing her foul deed . She's unrepentant . Hmm ? Do you not think she would show some emotion ? Well , of course , sir . I was just ... I realize , Laughton , that you may not have met a wife who has destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , alas , that such wives do exist . He used his imagination , Laughton . Imagination ... a word I think not in your vocabulary . For example ... "" I stand upon mine act . Yea , where I struck . "" Do you not think , uh , in saying those words she might reveal a flash of , uh , cruelty and of pride ? Hmm ? Defiant creature . And then here ... "" And I confess it , "" I did use such craft he could not fly nor fend him against death . "" "" I caught him in a net as men catch fish . "" No room , no rathole in his loopless robe . "" I struck him twice . "" And once and twice he groaned , he doubled up his limb . "" And with that stroke , committed him to Zeus that keeps the dead . "" Very well , you may leave . Good-bye , sir . Cheerio , sir . Good-bye , sir . Good-bye , Mr . Crocker-Harris . Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fa-la-la-la-la-la In the winsome month of May ... Oy ! Walk ! We've got to get him . I don't know . We'll get in trouble . Come on , Taplow . Trubshaw's always picking on you . We could do it tomorrow . Come on . It'll be a laugh . It's the last day of term . What can they do ? Thank you , sir . I realize , of course , you will not be putting so much emphasis on the study of Greek and Latin . Perhaps they may be even dropped from the curriculum , or made optional extras . My remit from the headmaster is to organize a new language department , sir . That really means modern languages . I believe we need a greater concentration on German , French , Spanish . It is , after all , a multicultural society . Ah , yes , yes ... the modern approach . Not so many years ago , the great passion was to learn Russian . Then came perestroika . Russian wasn't trendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to observe . Not at all . Perhaps we shall see each other later . Hello . Anybody home ? Just me , sir . Taplow . You are following me around . No . Sir . I've got extra work with Mr . Crocker-Harris . Uh-huh . But he's not here yet . And Mrs . Crocker-Harris ? Uh ... no , she's not here either . What are you studying ? Aeschylus , sir . The Agamemnon . Have you ever read it ? Well , no . I can't say that I have . Is it any good ? Oh , um ... well , as a matter of fact , it is , really . Yeah , well , what's it about ? Lt ... it's about a wife who's unfaithful , and murders her husband . I get it . A comedy . Say ... say , listen , did you get a chance to talk to Mr . Crocker-Harris about your transfer to my science class ? Yes . And ? What did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . What is it ? You have obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and certainly no more . Andrew ? Andrew , is that you ? Oh . What a pleasant surprise . Hi ya , Laura . Didn't expect to see you here . Hello , Taplow . Oh , Andrew asked me to come by . It's about my timetable for next term . Oh , and he's not here . Well , it's not like Andrew to be late , now , is it , Taplow ? No , Mrs . Crocker-Harris . Well , excuse me , gentlemen . I think I'll just go put these things upstairs . Do you think she heard ? Heard what ? Me impersonating ... Frank . Oh , I , uh ... I've got your timetable here , Andrew . Oh , excellent . Just what I wanted . Sorry I'm late , Taplow . I'll just put these down . Frank , we see you too rarely . Hello , Laura . Andrew , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you're going to be joining us at the concert tomorrow evening . Oh , yes . I'm looking forward to it . Taplow , why don't you go and get the lemonade ? You know where everything is . Thank you , Mrs . Crocker-Harris . How have you been ? Frank , would you like to see the timetable for next term ? Yes , I 'd like that very much , Andrew . Take that outside , Taplow . We'll have our glass in the garden today . Let's see . There you are . You've really done a beautiful job , Andrew . Well , thank you . It has the merit of clarity , I think . I don't know what we're going to do without you . You'll find somebody else , I expect . Or , uh ... perhaps they'll buy a computer . Say , what exactly is this new job of yours , Andrew ? Teaching English to foreigners . Andrew's doctor believes it will be less of a strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Andrew . There's nothing to be sorry about . I'm looking forward to the change . See you later . So long , Andrew . Begin , Taplow . "" Oh , Clytemnestra , we are surprised that ... "" "" We marvel at . "" "" We marvel at thy tongue ... Mm . "" ... how bold thou art , that thou can ... "" Canst "" is more poetic . Canst . "" ... canst utter such a boastful speech ... "" Mm . "" ... over the , the bloody corpse of the husband , you've just so foully murdered . "" Taplow , I presume you're using a different text to mine . No , sir . That's strange , I see no "" foully murdered , "" no "" bloody corpse . "" Simply ... "" husband . "" Yes , sir . Why do you insist on inventing words that are simply not there ? Go on , Taplow . Go on , I wish to understand . I was thinking a bit like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates her husband Agamemnon . He returns from winning the war , and what does she do ? She welcomes him back and then murders him . She stabs him over and over and then makes a speech ... I'm , I'm delighted in your interest in the more lurid aspects of dramaturgy , Taplow . But I still fail to understand why you should wish to improve Aeschylus . Today in class , sir ... for the first time I got a sense of the horror . L-It was so vivid . I mean , why can't we put more life into the translation , sir , like you did ? Why can't we use words like , like , "" bloody "" and "" corpse "" and "" murder ? "" Hmm . When I was a very young man , not much older than you are now , I wrote for my own pleasure a translation of the Agamemnon , a very free translation , I remember , in rhyming couplets . That must have been hard work . Yes , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived great pleasure from it , because the play had excited and moved me as it did you , and I wanted to communicate , however imperfectly , some of that emotion . A little like what happened in class today . My translation , I remember thinking was very beautiful ... almost more beautiful than the original . Was it ever published ? I'm sorry ? Was it ever published ? Oh , no , no . No , it was never published . Shall I go on , sir ? Uh , no , I fear we've run out of time . Um ... may I go now , sir ? Yes . And , Taplow ... "" The art of learning is to conceal learning . "" And I wouldn't try it on any of your friends . It isn't particularly funny . I wouldn't know , sir . Turn that , turn that ghastly noise down ! Off ! Now , Buller ... Where's Buller ? Your mother's just telephoned . She's awfully sorry , but neither she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here today . She wants you to take the train tomorrow . Shrewsbury . Then the chauffeur will meet you at the station . You all right , Buller ? Sir . Good . Keep the noise down . I know it's hard , Buller . But you'll get used to it , believe me . Fuck off . Good morning . Morning . Sleep well ? Yes , fine , thanks . And you ? Yes , fine , thank you . There you are . Oh , there's a ... a letter for you . Is everything all right ? Your mother all right ? Yes . Fine , fine . Um ... I forgot to cancel the papers . Do you need anything from the village ? No , no , thank you . Laura . Were you expecting someone else ? I thought we agreed that we wouldn't meet here . Who were you expecting ? Gilbert , the new guy . Laura ... come away from the window please . Would you please come away from the window ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty . It's the Puritan in you . I love fucking you . You talk when you make love . Kettle , it's , it's just boiling . Which is more , apparently , than we can say for you . Laura , I haven't got much time . No , I don't think I have either . Tea ? Frank , you're more English than the English . Listen , if Gilbert does come , let's just say you're here delivering a message from Andrew . To hell with Gilbert . I've got good news . Oh ? What ? Don't worry , I'm not pregnant . I've had a letter from my mother . She's decided to visit my sister in Canada . So , I can have her cottage in Dorset for the whole summer . That's great . Andrew starts his new job in September , but I don't have to go there immediately . That means you and I can be alone together . If you like . Just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won't you ? Frank ? Frank ... I need you . I need to be with you . You know my , my father's not well . I may have to go back to the States . God , you remind me of him . Of who ? Of whom . Of whom , of Andrew , of course . He didn't always used to be the old Croc , you know . He wasn't much older than you are now when I first met him . He was so pure , so ... so idealistic . But just as ungiving . What happened to him ? I did . Weren't you two ever happy together ? I can't remember . Can't remember . Laura , I ... I feel sorry for him . No you don't . You feel guilty because you're screwing his wife . Or to be more accurate , because his wife is screwing you . I think we should tell him . Tell him what ? About us . What , are you insane ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell would you want to tell him for , Laura ? What are we talking about now ... Marriage ? Divorce ? I'm talking about us . I don't want us to become just good friends . Listen , Laura ... Don't . Deja vu . I know exactly what you're going to say now . You're going to say you're not ready to settle down . Isn't that what you were going to say ? Anyone home ? Oh , yes , come in , Headmaster . Ah , Andrew , Andrew , can't stay long . Lovely day . Beautiful , yes . Uh , would you like to sit down ? Two things I wanted to discuss with you . Can I offer you tea or anything ? Oh , no , don't bother about tea . You have enough to do . Two most stressful things in life ... moving and divorce . You know , it's extremely unlucky ... ill health should have forced your retirement . Well , I felt that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was yourself and the governors who thought that my health ... Well , quite so , quite so . I was going on to say that it's unlucky about your having to retire before becoming entitled to a pension . You have decided not to award me a pension . Not I . Not I . Lord Baxter and the governors thought long and hard about it . They were felt unable to , um ... make an exception . But , uh ... exceptions have been made in the past , have they not ? Ah . Richardson , you mean . Well , those were exceptional circumstances . After all , it was in playing football , staff against school , he received his injury . I understand . The second thing I wanted ... Oh , Headmaster . I was just leaving . Oh , uh ... well , can I offer you a coffee or ... it's too early for sherry , isn't it ? Oh , it's far too early . No , I'll leave you to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve completed the timetable . It's hot . Would you like to take it with you ? Oh , thank you very much . Thank you very much , Andrew . Oh , what do you make of your successor , young Tom Gilbert ? He seems very agreeable . Very agreeable . High academic honors at Oxford . Chancellor's Prize for Latin verse . Oh , Andrew got that , too . And a double First . Of course you did . Sometimes it's hard to remember , you know , but you must be one of the most brilliant scholars ever to come to this school . You're very kind . Oh , when I say it's hard to remember , it's because you've done so many other good things . You know , timetable , your heroic battle for so long with the soul- destroying lower fifth . Well , I haven't found that my soul has been destroyed by the lower fifth , Headmaster . Oh . Uh ... No , I was only joking . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other matter you wished to discuss ? Oh , nothing , nothing at all , Andrew . And , uh , I was just saying , Laura , the two most stressing things in life ... moving house and divorce . Well , bad luck , Andrew and , um , I'll see you later . Bye-bye . Good-bye , sir . Well , do we get it ? Do we get what ? The pension . Do we get the pension ? No . What ? No . Why not ? It's against the rules . Well , Richardson got one . Why couldn't they give one to you ? It was special circumstances . He received his injuries playing soccer for the staff against the school . And what did you say ? Just stood there and made some joke in Latin , I suppose . There was very little I could say in Latin or any other language . Oh , I would have said something . Don't you worry , I would have ... I'm sure you would . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew ? You're a wimp . You always were and you always will be ... a double first-class wimp . You know , I think I could have forgiven you anything if you 'd have just once said , "" No . Enough , "" not just to me but to every setback you've ever had . There was an old lady of 82 ... Parlez-vous ? Oh ! Out . Go on , out . Out ! Out ! - Out ! - Out ! Not you , Taplow . Stay there . Out ! Move it ! Come on . You go to the Crock's house for extra work , don't you ? Yeah . Yes , Trubshaw . Yes ... Trubshaw . Very good . So what's the gossip , then ? I don't know , Trubshaw . Well , word is , Mrs . Crocker-Harris is having it off with somebody . Is that right ? I , I really don't know , Trubshaw . Oh , come on , Taplow ... I've seen you . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s she shagging ? Who is it ? Dr . Rafferty . I've no idea , honestly . Would you like to give her one ? Have you ever seen her tits ? I have . She was in the library once . She bent over . No bra , nothing . Gorgeous . I bet you 'd like to put your face between them , wouldn't you , Taplow , you little wanker ? Your parents coming down today ? No . No ? Oh . Why not ? Oh . Your mother's having it off with somebody as well . Word is , she's a good fuck , your mother . Is that right ? Huh ? Ah , Missus ... Missus , uh ... - Missus ... - Wilson . Wilson . How are you ? - I have a complaint . - Oh , dear . Ten spaghetti and one lettuce leaf is not enough for a growing boy . Ludwig tells me that's all he's had for dinner for the past week . - Ah , well ... - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s properly fed . I'll speak to the kitchens about it . Do excuse me , won't you ? I don't believe in stuffing the boys , you know , dear . Ah , King Abakendi . Do you know he owns most of Nigeria ? Really ? Oh , Your Majesty , how lovely to see you . Dr . Frobisher . Ah . You know my wife Jane . Madam . Of course . And Lord Baxter , head of Eurospace Industries , chairman of our governors . Yes , and , uh , Lady Baxter . Delighted , delighted . A chap from Nigeria working for me ... head of the design department . I'm sure you know him . Oh . What is his name ? We are very fortunate once again ... Oh , he's doing very well . You know , he's doing very well , this boy . Marvelous job he's doing , yes . Now , Your Majesty , you know , Lord Baxter and I would like to discuss our proposed center for Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opening the batting ... is their captain , David Fletcher . This will probably be the last time that we'll ever see David playing amateur cricket , as he goes to London tomorrow to join the NCC . I'm ... sorry , sir . Oh . No , no . It is I who should apologize . After all , this is your room now , not mine . If you'll allow me to continue with the chore of packing . I only came in here because this room is to become the center of the new language block , and , well , I didn't expect anyone to be here . I shan't be very long , I promise you . Please don't hurry , sir . The fact is , this afternoon , uh , I was feeling rather nervous . You know , attack of the jitters , and , uh , I thought that if I came in here and rehearsed taking a class or something , it ... it might calm me . Um , I expect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that ? You keep such order . I saw that yesterday morning , and , well , after all , they call you the "" Hitler of the Lower Fifth . "" That was clumsy of me , sir . I'm sure nothing's meant by it . It-it's just that you ... you keep such wonderful discipline , that's all . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . They're , uh , not bad boys . Sometimes a little wild and unfeeling , perhaps , but not bad . In the beginning , I tried very hard to communicate some of my own joy in the great literature of the past . I failed ... as , of course , you will fail 999 times out of a thousand . But a single success can atone for all the failures in the world and sometimes ... very rarely , it's true ... sometimes , I had that success . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . I'm desperately sorry . Don't apologize . I , uh , should have known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively disliked . I realized many long years ago that the ... the boys no longer laughed at me , but I ... I don't know why they no longer found me funny . Perhaps when you became ill . No . No , I don't think so . I really don't know . In the earlier years , they used to laugh at me . At me , not with me . At my ... uh ... funny mannerisms and tricks of speech , which we all develop . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . I would have thought that by now that epithet would have lost its significance . Apparently not . Undoubtedly ... it will become my epitaph . I'm sure they'll come up with something much worse for me . Well ... I bequeath you this room . I wish you a great success in it . I'll do my best , sir . And good luck to you in your future career . My future career ? Yes . Thank you . The , uh ... The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't they ? And there's another four runs to Fletcher . Ah , Laura , Andrew . Headmaster , Lord Baxter . Good afternoon . Uh , Lord Baxter and I would like to ask you , uh ... have a little chat with you , Andrew . Uh , good time for a word ? Well , the great thing about cricket is you can talk and watch at the same time . Precisely well put , Laura . A little favor I have to ask you , Andrew . And what favor would that be , Headmaster ? It concerns tomorrow's Prize Giving . I take it you're prepared to say a few words ? Yeah . Well , I have , uh , I have made a few notes . Oh , well hit . Well hit , Fletcher . Good , good , good . I know I can trust your discretion , not to mention your wit . And I'm sure you'll agree with me that we don't want these things to become too long and distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puns and jokes in my speech . That would be extremely acceptable . Oh . Fine stroke , Fletcher . Oh , yes . Yes , that's good , just the thing . I-I also want to touch on a matter of some gravity . No doubt , no doubt . Now , the favor I want to ask you is this . You see , Fletcher ... Fletcher is much , much junior to you , of course , and , uh , as such , his speech would come first , and yours last . Absolutely . But , uh , you know how the boys feel about David . They adore him . They simply adore him . Now , there could well be a terrific display of emotion tomorrow , which would be difficult for me to cut short . Fletcher's simply racing to his talent . So , uh , do you wish me to speak first ? Well , I feel wretched about asking you this , Andrew . I really do . But , you know , a thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sure you 'd agree with me there . You understand , don't you , Laura ? Well , naturally , Headmaster , I would not wish to provide an anticlimax . I'll speak first . Don't take it amiss , Andrew . Nothing personal . Boys will be boys . I mean , they 'd much rather applaud the-the sportsman than the scholar . It's only natural . But it's quite impersonal , I promise you . Well played , Tom ! Well played ! The possibility of a century here for David Fletcher . Laura ? Ah . Yes , Diana . Isn't Fletcher batting superbly ? Oh , uh , just fantastic , but I got to tell you , every time he hits the ball , I think he's going to drop the bat and run to first base . - Oh , really . - Good heavens . He's 95 . This could be his 100th . Oh . Yes , that's 100 on Fletcher . Tea , I think , everybody . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon . Mmm . Tea and cakes ? You coming to tea ? I 'd rather watch a little more cricket if you don't mind . Uh , Frank ? Could you escort Laura to tea , please ? Sure . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the school supports many charities , and some of the charities that we do support will have stands in and around the chapel today so that you can see the sort of work that the school is doing with the money ... Sir ? Sir ? Uh , I'm sorry to disturb you , sir , but-but I did want to see . Disturb me , indeed . Well ? Um ... Well , Taplow ? I ... I thought this might interest you , sir . First translation of the Agamemnon , sir . Good heavens . The Browning version . I've glanced at it . I don't think it's much good , but ... I agree , the translation has its faults , but I think you'll enjoy it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browning employs . Very interesting , Taplow . It ... it's for you , sir . For me ? Yes , sir . I-I've written in it . Did you ... buy this ? Yes , sir . It's only secondhand . You shouldn't spend your pocket money in that way . That's all right . It wasn't very much . The price isn't still inside , is it ? No . Only what you wrote . Nothing else . What's the matter , sir ? Have I put the accents wrong ? No . The perispwmenon is perfectly correct . Oh ... Forgive me ... Taplow , I've ... I've been under rather a strain . Yes , sir . I understand . Well good-bye , sir . And the best of luck . That's tea ! Ladies and gentleman , the umpire has called tea , which will be taken in the large dining marquee near the entrance to the chapel . Mr . Crocker-Harris . Uh , excuse me , sir . Do you remember us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't tell me . Wait a moment . Trimmer , and you're Newton . Yes , sir . We just saw you there , sir , thought we 'd say hello , sir . And what have you two been up to ? I'm in banking , sir . Actually , I'm the managing director of National Western . Are you , indeed ? And I'm in the Army , sir . Communications . Communications , eh ? But not in classical Greek , I fancy . Well , actually , sir , Newton's the youngest brigadier in the British Army . Indeed ? Congratulations . Stand easy , Brigadier . Oh . Well , it's very nice to see you both . Yes , sir . I see Fletcher got his hundred , sir . Oh , well , it's only to be expected . He's a superb player . And-And quite , uh , quite beautiful to watch , isn't he ? Yes . Well , continued success to you . - And to you , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God help me , I'm still terrified of the old bugger . Me , too . Wonderful inning . Special , Dave . - Thank you , sir . - Splendid . Excuse me . So , there I was in my hotel corridor , absolutely naked , and no key . I wish I 'd been there . Andrew , have a seat . Oh , thank you . - Thank you . - Hello , Andrew . You're looking pleased with yourself . What have you been up to ? That's a lot to ask , Laura . Well , I'm looking pleased with reason . I think I've just been given a present . Oh , by whom ? - Taplow . - Taplow ? That's fantastic . Hey . So , what was the present ? Well , it's , uh , a translation of The Agamemnon , by , uh , by Robert Browning . - Great . - Let me see . Oh , he's inscribed it . What does it mean ? Darling ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh , it's all Greek to me . Mr . Gilbert , can you enlighten us , please ? Uh , how marvelous . It's a hexameter . Yes , but what does it mean ? Well , I'm not familiar with th-the Browning version , but , uh , roughly , uh , it translates as : "" God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master . "" Oh , how sweet ! And very apt . Can't imagine a boy giving me a present . Nor me . A very wonderful thing to do , don't you think ? - Yes . - Yes , very much , so , yeah . And he , he bought it with his own pocket money . What was the inscription again ? "" God from afar looks graciously upon a kind master . "" Well , perhaps not "" kind master , "" but ... "" gentle master . "" Yes , I agree , uh , with Mr . Gilbert . I think "" gentle "" is a better translation . Uh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would rather have this present than anything else I could think of . Cunning little brat . Why cunning , Laura ? Andrew , you don't have any wine . Can I give you some champagne ? Why cunning , Laura ? Because yesterday , I saw Taplow doing an impersonation of you for Frank . Well , obviously he was afraid that I would tell you , and that you would put him on Cromwell's , or stop his switch to Frank's form , or some other Hitlerian torture . The book is clearly an insurance policy ... a sweetener . A bribe . I see . Laura , go and tell him it was a lie . Certainly not . It wasn't a lie . Then I'll tell him . I wouldn't do that if I were you . He'll only hate you for your sympathy . Andrew doesn't need sympathy . That's his strength . Andrew ? I want to make something clear about Taplow . He has a genuine affection for you . Andrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure that book . I 'd rather like to be left alone at the moment , thank you . You may find that it'll ... have a special meaning to you . Oh , yes , it will mean something . It will remind me of my own foolishness . You don't deserve this . I mean ... You've been treated badly , sir . By the school , you mean ? Not just by the school . Never , never presume to know the secrets of a marriage . Take my advice ... sir . Make a new start for yourself . You could still find someone who will care for you , who'll ... who'll be loyal , and who won't ... who'll ... be faithful . Ah . Hmm . We ... We were incompatible from the moment we met . Although ... neither of us realized that at the time . Of course , Laura was , uh ... was only 22 years of age . We both required love , but of different kinds . Worlds apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic ... or abnormal . Just the problem of a dissatisfied wife and an inadequate husband . Often , I believe , a subject for Faust . Is there anything I can do to help you ? I 'd like to help ... you . Yes . Don't take sides . It's so very unbecoming . Hey ! Did you see that , Andrew ? 112 nut out , Fletcher , and seven for 23 . Send out the schools . Skittle them out . Let me do that . You left Taplow's present behind . I put it in your study . Thank you . It wasn't a very good impersonation . I'm ... I'm sorry . Laura . We , uh ... we inhabit different worlds , you and I . We always have . We always will . What are you saying ? I'm saying "" No . "" I'm saying , "" Enough . "" Better not keep the headmaster waiting . Do you still expect me to come to your Prize Giving ? I , uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer to expect anything of the other . Right . Well , I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning then . As you wish . And does your new school provide spending accommodation for staff ? We haven't found anything that we like yet . I've read somewhere the two worst things in life are moving house and divorce . So , Laura , if I were you , I ... Oh , hello , darling . Well , I finished my rounds . Do you know , I often think being a headmaster's like being a head waiter , except head waiters have to learn how to speak at least five languages . This isn't the best moment , sir , but we're not staying the night , so , um ... if ever you need any financial advice , uh , assistance in deed ... anything of that sort , please telephone . I 'd like to help . Think of it as , um ... well , as repayment . Well , thank you very much . This is extremely civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . - I'll see you . - Good night . Shut it . You'll get me in trouble . What's going on ? It's all right . - You all right , man ? - Yeah , yeah . You little fucking bastards . Yes ! Hello ? Anybody there ? Oh , Foster . Sorry to disturb you , sir . I've come to pick up Mrs . Crocker-Harris . Oh , yes , yes . She's upstairs . Laura , Mr . Foster's here . I'm coming ! Glorious day . Indeed , sir . Glorious . Sorry to hear about your ... mother-in-law , sir . Ah , yes , yes . Must be a disappointment , sir . Your wife ... not being there for your farewell speech . And ... if I may be so bold , sir ... Well , what is it , Foster ? Well , I 'd just like to say the old place won't be the same without you , sir . Well , thank you , Foster . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster . Would you mind , uh ... there's a couple of suitcases upstairs . Thank you . I think there's , uh , just two more . Well , I mustn't , uh , be late for the Prize Giving . No , eh ... You look very impressive . Yes ? Good-bye . Ah , Andrew , there you are . Right , follow me , everyone . Headmaster , I must tell you I've changed my mind . I , uh , wish to speak second , as is my right . What about Mr . Fletcher ? Mr . Fletcher will have to speak first . But you promised yesterday . Yes , but I now see the matter in an entirely different light , and , uh , today's today . Uh , we're ready for you now ... Just a second , please , Trubshaw . Look , if you speak second ... It'll be the most dreadful anticlimax . Be that as it may , as senior master it is my privilege to so do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . The demill Prize for French studies : S.R . Ryan . The Torkson Prize for Excellence : S . Trubshaw . The Hanson Cup for Biology : E.R . Morris . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my painful duty to listen with you to a few sad words from two masters who are leaving us . First , I shall call upon ... First , let us call upon Mr . David Fletcher . I thought you were going to speak first . Well , chaps ... I'm not much good , you know ... you know , on my feet , except when I'm running between the wickets . So I'll just say I'm really ... sad , you know , to be leaving this wonderful old place . I've loved it here . So , you know ... good luck and ... good-bye . Now , three cheers for David Fletcher ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! And now ... Mr . Andrew Crocker-Harris . Study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our culture . And culture is simply an expression of what is best in society . Philosophy , decent government , justice , art , language . Our classical heritage is no longer valued . And how can we help meld civilized human beings ... if we no ... if we no longer believe in civilization ? I am sorry . I'm sorry because I have deserved the epithet "" Hitler of the Lower Fifth . "" I am sorry because I have failed to give you what it is your right to demand of me as your teacher . Sympathy , encouragement , humanity . I have degraded the noblest calling a man can follow ... the care and molding of the young . When I came to this school ... I still b-believed tha-that ... uh , that I ... I had a-a vocation for teaching . I knew what I wanted to do , and yet , I ... I did not do it . I can offer no excuses . I have failed , and miserably failed . And I can only hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countless others who've gone before you ... to ... forgive me for having let you down . I shan't find it ... easy to forgive myself . That is all . Go on . Sir ? Taplow , boys . Good-bye , sir . Good-bye , Taplow . Gentlemen . Bye , sir . Taplow ? Mm . Well , it means if you have any regard for me , next term you will kindly refrain from blowing yourself up when you switch to science . Thank you , sir . Yes ! Well done , Taplow . Thanks a lot . Well done . Well ... You'll miss your train . I'll ... I'll write .

I didn't know the trains still ran from Cleveland . Well , you have to change in Chicago . Here you go , old boy . Would you like a cigar ? - I 'd love to but no , thank you . - Okay . - Cheers , Harry . - Cheers . - Good luck this afternoon . - Thanks , baby ; good to see you . I can't fly anymore .

Why don't you just give me an open end order ... and I'll fill it personally and then you won't have to come to the show ? I told you I just got off a train . I don't know , I can't think about business . I got ta relax . All right . Say , Harry ... is that girl still around ? What girl ? That ... What's her name ? Margo .

Harry , I don't make calls like that from Cleveland . Harry , I don't want to argue with you . You and me , we go back a hell of a long ways . I spent 5,362 nights ... with a sick woman .

We haven't done anything so far ... and they can't lock you up for just thinking about something . Not yet , anyway . How's Linda ? Has she gotten over her fishing phobia yet ? - No , but she enjoys the boat . - Not doing any fishing , though . Nope . I'm still the only fisherman . I guess it's nice out there on a Sunday . Peaceful , quiet . Yeah . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you've forgotten what the ocean smells like . I remember when I was a kid , I hitched a ride on a trolley car to Coney Island . Saw the ocean for the first time . God , nothing could make me forget it . Just blue and green . You ought to come out on the boat , Harry . Yeah , I guess I should . Keep it . You're a very generous citizen . Take a good look at us , we're a vanishing breed . Do you see this , Mac ? You know what it is ? It's a portable bathroom . I can't take five minutes off for a piss . - So don't make jokes with me , mister ! - All right , I'm sorry . - I didn't mean anything . Here , take this . - Stick it up your ass ! It's the pollution , Harry . It makes everybody crazy . - Do you have any drops with you ? - No . My eyes are burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Los Angeles . - What's that ? - It's not Buffalo . You son of a bitch . You know how many times that I've fallen for that ? Did you see in the paper this morning where we lost 3,000 helicopters ? You know how much money that is ? Hell , I don't want to hear about that , drop it . What's the matter ? I mean , the waste , the money . - The men . - Men ? Yeah , the men . What do you want me to say about that ? Hell , I just don't want to talk about it . Screw the helicopters . For God's sake , Harry , what are you getting upset ... - Phil , please ! - I just meant the waste ... - Phil ! - The money . Remember when I went to Milan last year ? - Cotton mills ? - Yeah , that's right . Covered the cotton mills . Then I flew to Rome and I drove down to Anzio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all piled up like a dune ... you know ; it runs about 200 feet . In 1944 that sand was muddy with blood . And last year it was covered with bikinis . Bikinis , you know , cute little buckets ... sweating into the same sand that held all that blood . Hell , I don't want to talk about war . It's the final joke . It shouldn't surprise you . Battlefields have a way of turning into resorts . Wait a minute . Yeah ! Air Mail Special . Only that's not Charlie Christian , he was the original . Oh , Jesus , that was Big Band showtime . One time ... I'm just a kid , see ? And I'm playing drums , we're in this divey joint ... it's up in the mountains . We had a vocalist . Everybody in the band is banging her except me ... and I got a crush on her . God . These Foolish Things . She could sing These Foolish Things , put you right in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her was just ... Before a number she 'd come over ... she 'd lean down and she 'd whisper to me , "" Easy on the brushes , kid ... "" easy on the brushes . "" She was gon na be vocalist with Tommy Dorsey . I was gon na play the drums with Benny Goodman . The difference is , when we were kids all the choices were simple . - Life was simple . Everything added up . - No more . This morning I gave a ride , this kid was hitching . She just goes up and down the Strip . She wanted to ball me , she said . No words , just ... She was hardly older than my daughter ... makes you wonder what the hell's going on out there . Who knows ? Rats are crawling around babies ... they're taking pictures of Mars ... and we're in the balcony talking to Charlie Robbins . Stoner . How are you ? Good to see you again . - Who was that ? - That's Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom . - Hell , Rico's taking care of it . It's his great and glorious moment . Leave him alone . - What'll it be , gents ? - Two White Label on the rocks . You've got ta solve this thing between Rico and Meyer . What ? When are you gon na learn Spanish ? When you learn to fish . I wonder how Freddy's doing . Freddy doesn't have to do anything . Margo's doing all the work . Margo the Machine . The working man's friend . Ernie Koy . Indian Ernie , center-field for the ' 39 Dodgers . I damn near had it fleshed out . Now wait a minute . We had Camilli , Pete Coscarart , Durocher's at short .

Stoner , you got a call for me ? Right field . Damn . Hello . Listen , don't you call anybody , you stay right there , we'll be right up ! - He's alive . - What ? - Making sounds . - Fred ? - I got him breathing . - Oh , my God ! What the hell did you ... You call the desk , get Johnny , and tell him to get the house doctor . A friend of mine , a buyer , collapsed . Get an ambulance . Fred , can you hear me ? It's me , Harry . Fred . He kept pleading with us to prolong it . Prolong it ? Why , for Christ's sake , you're a pro ! You're supposed to know the limits . You know how far to go ! For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out of here ! Shut up and get out , both of you , right now ! Room 9227 . It looks like it might be a heart attack . We need the doctor right away , hurry . I said get out of here ! - I'm sorry , Harry . - Yes , so am I . Ambulance and doctor on the way . Damn it ! We should have gotten the order up front . Order ? Thank God he's alive ! We're responsible , we set this thing up . We're to blame here . The man may die . So he dies ! Then he won't get horny any more . - You're talking about a man , Harry . - He's not a man , he's a casualty . Stay with him and tell the doctor to give him the best and send us the bill . I got to get down to the show . - Jackie , where the hell is he ? - I haven't the slightest idea . - They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm gon na cue the musicians . We're going to start without him . Alfie , did you get the rest of the 238's ? Everything's been here , for the last half hour . Your timing is exquisite . We were just going on . Are you all right , Mr . Stoner ? - I'm fine . - You're sure ? Yes , I'm fine . Welcome to Los Angeles . Before we begin our show , this afternoon ... I should like to present our president , the president of Capri Casuals ... the man who made all this possible , Mr . Harry Stoner . Thank you . Thank you , Jackie . First I would like to ... welcome all of you , thank you for being present ... of course , I don't know all of you personally , but our field men do . And through our ... field men ... our professional ties with some of you ... go back 15 years . There are some faces missing . But the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ... what we're going to present , this afternoon . Our field men , of course , will ... remain after the show , to take your orders ... and answer the questions , on delivery dates ... and trajectory and costs . That's ... Capri has a very special significance for me ... because I was recuperating there , you see ? It was a sanctuary for the living ... it was beautiful , Roman columns and it was quiet ... and it was filled with men , brave men that stuck together ... because they believed in something . It had a very special significance ... - What Mr . Stoner means ... - Capri ... Is that Capri was not an accident , but rather an inspiration . Now , how about a nice round of applause for Mr . Stoner ? Ladies and gentlemen ... we begin our show and our theme , this afternoon is , Isle of Capri . We designed this line for the chic woman ... Now as usual , you've all been given your description list ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . So let's start the show this afternoon , with Number 235 ... White , uncrushable linen pantsuit , marvelous red wallpaper printed shirt ... tied together , with its own matching belt . Available in two other color combinations . - Are you all right ? - Fine , yeah . Something wrong ? What the hell is wrong ? Nothing is wrong .

I just wanted to tell you Harry , I'm sorry . Everybody misses . Not professionals . Yeah , professionals , too . Quarterbacks get knocked down ... nurses get knocked up , somebody invented the Edsel . Everybody misses . Everybody misses . - Would you care for something to drink ? - No . Just the check . Okay . Must've scared the hell out of you . Look , some night let's have dinner . What are we going to talk about ? Business . - Yours or mine ? - We both sell the same thing . - What's that ? - Imagination . Yeah , that's what they buy . Trick or treat ? It's always Halloween , isn't it ? Every day .

And the first color shocker combines ... a side-wrap pleated skirt with an updated classic shirt ... which you will see throughout this line . That's Number 242 . And Number 243 ... Hey , who let you out ? A packable , washable , banaline ... designed to hold and flatter the figure . It has an elasticized bodice , a bare back ... This is the look that has made our line so popular in the past . Hell of a line , Phil . - How are you , Sid ? - I'm good , Phil , like always . I was watching those garments , they'll walk out of the stores . - Congratulations . - Thanks . - Phil , you got the gelt ? - Some . Big line , you'll get big orders , you'll need big money . - I suppose we will . - Suppose ? That ain't exactly a bar mitzvah you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . Hello , Sidney , how are they hanging ? They're hanging good , Harry , like always . How much you boys selling money for these days ? He has to ask me what the terms are . 12% on the unpaid balance , first of the month and then it graduates . Graduates ? I understand , it levels off about 200% ? - Well , another account ... - We'll let you know later ? Listen , you guys are in the middle . The banks , they ain't gon na give you shit . You make everything run , they don't grease you . Look around in there , you see any banks ? But we'll throw dice with you . Yeah , but we got a movie , we got ta see . Come on , Phil . Movie ? They haven't made a good movie in 30 years . - What do you say , fellas ? - We'll keep in touch , okay ? Goodbye , Sidney . What's that rot you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Havana . Smell the ocean , enjoy . - We'll talk to you later . Come on , Phil . - So long , Sid . Say , that's a nice suit , you're wearing , Harry . Passatti ? - Yeah . - Sid , thanks for the cigar . Nothing . That's a good sign . If the Mob sent Sid , the word must be out we have a hot line . The Mob has money for us and the banks don't . It's a great system . Well , I guess the bank figures if they don't give it to us the Mob will . The Mob would give it to us all right . Can you imagine living with their hooks into you ? - No worse than arson . - It's worse . Remember what happened to Georgie Kramer , a couple of years ago ? A 400 pound Turk walks in his office ... hangs him out a 13 story window by his ankles ... and says , "" Next time I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen one of these things . - What things ? - A blue movie . - Just life in a close-up . - Do they actually show everything ? What's to show ? A couple of naked bodies crawling all over each other ... some guy holding a camera hollering , "" Not yet , not yet . "" Yes , so what was he doing , in a gay bar ? You're putting me on ! So listen , how did you make out ? - Two , please . - $10 . What ? - $10 . - You're kidding . $5 a head . You want a pair or not ? What are you giving away ? The name of our attraction is Denmark Speaks . Been here for 18 weeks . Famous smorgasbord scene . Just a minute . You can have a private booth for $15 . - Do you qualify for Medicare ? - Yeah ? How about that . If you don't mind , ma'am , please , two tickets ? Let's go . The Danes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland . I remember years ago I saw Quo Vadis here and now they're playing this crap . It's still the same thing . They just took their togas off . ... but total joy in the penultimate seconds of orgasm . The young people in a totally liberated society ... demonstrate in this scene the magnificence of fallatio or oral sex . See how these young people are made happy ... by the slow feeling of one another ... - Nice suit . - Thanks . - Silk ? - Yeah . - Hong Kong ? - Rome . Nice . Thank you . Give it to me . Phil , give it to me . Here's the down payment , the key , and the address . Don't look at me . Watch the screen . What time is it vacant ? After 6:00 . What else is there ? Well , there's a shirt company on the ground floor ... - we're on the second floor , that's all . - Watch the screen , Harry . We're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump gasoline with a cigarette in your mouth ... just watch the screen . How old is the building ? Thirty-five ? Thirty-seven . I'll check it out tonight . Meet me here tomorrow , 10:00 a.m . - Right . - We don't want anyone hurt . You want to forget it , say so . We just don't want anyone hurt , understand ? Look at the screen , Phil . Please , let's net confuse morality with technology . You're not talking to some pyromaniac . I've set 15 major industrial fires across the country in the last three years . I've had two firemen overcome by smoke inhalation . They both recovered , received citations . If they 'd issue the new C-15 masks ... smoke wouldn't be a problem anymore anyway . They use them in France , you know . This is a science , gentlemen , an exact science . Whether or not to set the fire is a moral question . - That's up to you . - It's in your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here tomorrow , same pew . Nice suit , Harry . ... as you now witness ... You got to respect Charlie , all business . Phil , it is the only way out . ... helps demonstrate explicitly the amount of precision ... Let's go ! Harry , that man is a lunatic ! Sits there with his hands on his stomach and a glazed look in his eye . - He's the best , Phil . - I think we ought to go back to Sid ... - talk to him and make a deal ! - Phil , will you forget about Sid ? Behind that Havana cigar is a killer . Yes , but Sid's money can keep us going ! I am not gon na donate a year of my life paying 200% to any Mob ! Now , do you understand that ? I'm sorry . Go back to the office , will you ? Get together with Meyer and line out the orders . I'm gon na take a walk . I'll see you at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiger ? Only takes a signature . Only 556 of them left . Think we ought to keep them around , don't you ? Yeah . - How's Cuban Pete ? - Cuban Pete ? He took a walk , he feels great . How much did we write ? - A little over three . They ate it up . - What did I tell you ? I'm going home . You want to have dinner with us ? I don't think so . Can I borrow one of your shirts ? Help yourself . That's two you owe me . Salesmen are happy ? What 'd they say ? The usual , "" Can we deliver ? "" Meyer's going over the orders . He wants to see you . Well , with what we wrote discounted at the bank ... and Charlie , we're gon na squeeze through . I checked Swissair , they got a flight to Geneva , stops in New York . Good idea . You can see your daughter before we go to jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we got to get out of bed every morning . At least I don't get out of bed in Beverly Hills . Well , how I lead my life doesn't have anything to do with our business . Just takes a little pressure off when your nut isn't sky high . It's my pressure , Phil , my nut . Except when it spills off . Like this afternoon at the show . It's a criminal act , Harry ! What criminal act , Phil ? To keep people working ? That's what you yourself said this morning , isn't it ? Is it a criminal act to try to hang on to 15 years of hard work ? What the hell was our dream ? To meet a payroll and not a pay check . Wasn't that the dream ? That was the big slice of the pie . Everybody in this whole God damn country dances around the law , Phil . - Now what's a criminal act ? You tell me . - So the end justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the scoreboard , baby . - That's the way they play it . - Who's "" they ? "" We're "" they . "" - And there are rules . - Wrong . Used to be . No more rules , just referees . And no room out there for losers , believe me . You and me out on that street again ? Why , Christ ! What would we do ? Where would we go ? We're obsolete . You want logic , Phil . And there is no Ministry of Logic , in this country . Performance used to count , right ? For 15 years we've met our obligations with the same unions ... the same mills , the same bank , but today ... all they care about is the bottom line on a passbook ... and then some God damn machine gives you a bum credit rating . So history doesn't count anymore . It's our place , Phil , we don't get down on our knees to anybody . You expect me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't you understand ? It's people like us , people in the middle , that made this country work . And when people like ourselves get into this kind of thing ... it takes it all down . That's what's ripping the country apart ! Son of a bitch , don't you sell America , to me ! I've got friends over there sitting under the sand with bikinis on their heads ! I used to get goose bumps every time I looked at that flag . When I was a kid , sitting alone in the room playing the radio ... if they ever played the national anthem , I stood up all alone in the room . I stood up at attention . Don't sell me America ! Now they're making jock straps out of the flag . Maybe it's terrific . Maybe it's healthy , I don't know . But I do know there are no more rules . That stinks , Harry . Hello , Boss . - Don't call me Boss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got the accounts , you made it work . Don't call me Boss . How's everything looking ? I don't want to talk about the line . Meyer , I need Rico and I need you , now what do you want me to say ? Harry , I'm old . I can't be in a playpen with fairies . Even talented fairies . You have a job here till you die . But you need Rico . Tell me to get out . I don't want you out , Meyer . What do you want ? Come on , tell me . I'm listening . I'm an old stone . Tell me , what do you want ? Another season . That's all ? Another season ? Just survival ? No dreams ? No hope ? Hope ? Better ask the little old lady in Vegas with the Dixie cup full of nickels ... if she still has hope . She's still looking for the three cherries . I'm sorry . I'm sorry for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your life running from pogroms , Nazis . Bent over a machine . What the hell have you got ? I have my craft . My work . And a woman . Old , but still lovely . I like to look at her , to listen to her talk . So sweet . And it's every day . That's good . Yeah , that's good . Now get out of here . Let me work . I'll deal with the fairy . We've had our talk . Go to your mansion . Go to your Mexican cook .

Why do you compare your cars to airplanes ? Oh , I cook up missions all over the county ... keeps my head in the clouds . Anyhow , the Wildcat ... the thing about this plane was , it was the very first American fighter in the Pacific , which is where I fought in the war . Oh . Anyhow , right here ... step on over here . - Camilla : Oh , look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellcat . The car's name is Chevelle . You see it right there . Chevelle's a little quicker than GTO , handles better too . And the grand finale over here ... Oh , I love this one . Oh . It's something . - Does it go fast ? - Yeah , it does . - I bet it does . - They all do . Mm . Now the Corsair had 11:1 kill ratio . - This ... don't sit on it . - Oh . - Don't sit on it . - Terribly sorry . It's okay . Anyhow , the Corsair had 11 : 1 kill ratio and the Corvette ... 11 : 1 compression ratio . - Isn't that something else ? - Lt is . it really is . It's a beautiful , beautiful machine . I'll tell you what : I love this thing . Now see , notice how the hood's so long , that pretty hood , longer than the ass end so much , see ? Well , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . See there ? I do . Do you know you're like a little child when you talk about them ? What do you mean ? A kid can't fly these things . Well , it's just not any son of a bitch that can handle them . I mean , you can make a mistake pretty easy , believe me . Have I upset you ? They're beautiful . Yes , they are . I feel real strange about Mama . Dear Naomi ... what an eccentric creature she was . I wonder why she didn't tell us she was sick . She just didn't want you to worry . There was nothing you could do . Your accent sure is pretty . I could listen to you talk all day long . I need to smoke a reefer with my nephews . You want to go with me ? Yes , I do . Thank you . I noticed you didn't eat much . You don't like Daddy's cooking ? Oh , no , no , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sure it's wonderful , but I can only eat a very bland diet . How come ? I was a prisoner during the war , of the Japanese . The culinary skills of the Jap cooks left a lot to be desired . My insides were left a bit of a wreck . Oh . I'm sorry . I didn't mean to be nosy . No , that's quite all right . All three of my brothers were in the war . Carroll was in the marines . He was a medic . Skip was a pilot in the navy . They both got decorated . Jimbo was in the army , but he don't talk about it much . He ran the laundry at Fort Polk . He's so damn jealous of the other boys ' medals , you 'd think he was in high school . Well , he shouldn't feel that way . He did his bit . Yeah , try telling Jimbo that . Try telling Jimbo anything . He's Daddy's boy all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you married ? Divorced . Oh . You got any kids ? No . Is she pestering the shit out of you , Phil ? No , no , no , not at all . Neal , get me a beer . Well , shit , you got legs . Well , may I thank you for your hospitality , Mr . Caldwell ? The barbecue was superb . Yeah , well , see you tomorrow . Hey , sweet ass . Hey , come here a minute . Come here a minute . Yeah . Camilla : Hey , you're blotto . Hey , listen , there's something I was thinking about . I just want to ask you ... This English accent of yours ... there's something about it . There's just something about it . Now , uh , I know we don't know each other that good yet . And I'm sure that you're not gon na just actually do it with me yet , but ... But I was wondering sometime can we just slip off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know , and just let me beat off to you ? Beat off ? Um ... beat ... beat off . What , have a wank ? See ? That's what I'm talking about ... that damned English . Makes me hornier than Frank Sinatra . "" Have a wank ? "" You're mad as a March hare . I ain't mad . I just get real focused on things . - Think about it . - Okay . Goodbye . Skip : Hey , think about it . Dispatch : S.O . to 44A . Man over radio : 44A . Go ahead . Dispatch : Sheriff , are you still out at Good Frank's ? Give me a 10-84 to Mr . Meyer's . Jim : Mm-hmm , yeah . He's making threatening phone calls to neighbors , telling them he's gon na kill their cat . Caller advised of a possible 10-96 . Sheriff : All right . Dispatch : Unit 59 , 10-20 ? - Hey . - Hey , Daddy . - Hey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so far . - Yeah . - Yeah . it's all kind of hard to think about , huh ? What ? Are you gon na be okay tomorrow , you think ? Tomorrow ? Well , what about it ? The funeral . Dispatch : All units , we have a three-car accident - up on Lance highway ... - Yeah . - Yeah . - Four fatalities confirmed , several injuries , not real sure how many . It's a shame about ol ' Naomi , you know , it really is . Yeah . You ain't fooling me . Yeah ? I got ta go . There's a big wreck right down the road . - See you later . - Okay , Daddy . Man over radio : In five minutes . Lance highway - and Scott Ranch Road . Over . - Dispatch : 10-4 . Let's bring in that new mystery challenger . Woman : God bless you . Go on in . There you go . Well , yeah . Yeah . There you go . Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pops ? - Please . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Naomi . I forgive you this time . Bye-bye . There you go , Mama . Go on , buddy . Mama ? - Da ... Daddy ? - Hey , buddy , hey . - Daddy ? - Hey , it's okay . it's okay . Go on . Go get with Dad . Phillip : Father . - Camilla : Father . Oh my God . - Phillip : Okay . Donna : What ... ? - Carroll : Yeah , loosen his tie . - Father . Somebody get a doctor . - Give him some air . - Donna : Where's your phone ? Camilla : Father . Carroll : Hey , get some water . Man : There you go . Donna : Well , somebody ought to go with them . They're in a strange town . They don't know anybody . Donna , we're all headed over to the church now for your mama's funeral . All right ? Carroll : She's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Donna : Oh my God , I hope he's all right . What if he's dead ? Thank you . Neal : Broken teeth and bones and hair and shit ... I mean , it's the hardest fought game ... He's gon na pinch my last nerve . Neal : We got one point with one second to go - and you know what happens ? - I don't know . They missed the dang extra point ! Oh , hey , babe , did they get your mama buried all right ? - Yeah . - Hey , listen , I got ta get something else to eat . This thing tastes like shit . - How's your daddy doing ? - He's doing well . Thank you . He had a heart attack about three years ago , so of course we were worried about that . But the doctor said he just fainted because of the stress and exhaustion . He's resting now . And Camilla's with him . Oh , thank God . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd release him in ... in ... in a bit . But they don't want him to travel for a day or two , which means we ... we won't be leaving tomorrow . Well , he can't stay at the Pines Motel . I mean , none of y'all should be there in the first place . That ain't nothing but an after-prom fuck joint . No telling whose jizz y'all are sleeping on . Y'all are staying at Daddy's . That's very kind , but we couldn't possibly . Oh , yes , you could possibly . I think it's a great idea . Daddy would insist . Neal : All right , girls , let's go . We got shit to do . Phillip : Neal , thank you so much for your help at the hospital . Neal : Hey , no sweat , slick . Take care of yourself , all right ? Donna : Y'all drive safe . Call me when you get there . Hey , Neal , keep it on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those beers back there . - Aunt Donna . - Yeah ? Uh , Connell's band's playing tonight . Really ? Yeah , at the main dollar store parking lot . And I'm doing the sound and the lights . Uh , you ought to come . - All right . - All right ? - Okay , I'll see you later then . - I'll see you there . Okay . I feel like dancing anyway . Let's go dance . I should stay here with my father . You need to relax . There's a whole house full of people to take care of your daddy . Well , I'm not really a dancer . Well , you will be when I get through with you . Hey , what's going on ? Any gruesome car crashes ? Any homicides ? No , doesn't appear to be , no . Too bad . Hey , let me ask you a question . How cold can it be in there ? Is it really that dark and cold inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day of his mama's funeral ? You're drunk . Go home . Yeah . Hey , let me ask you another question . You remember when I was wounded on Saipan , I was in the hospital for three months ? Jim : Of course I do . Yeah , I wrote you a letter from that hospital . I spilled my guts out to you . I told you everything you ever meant to me , about how when I signed up , I became a medic ' cause you were a medic in World War I and ... and ... and how I didn't mind getting shot because ... ' cause I figured that you was finally , you know , proud of me and how I admired you more than anybody else in the world , even President Roosevelt . And you never wrote me back . I mean , you never said one word about that letter , not to this day . I never got a letter like that . You're lying , Pops . Donna told me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up or something . Your letter must have got lost , lost in the mail . You know , I used to think that you were seven feet tall . I spent my whole childhood just trying to be just ... just like you . God damn , I'm glad I didn't succeed . Hmm . Yeah . You turned out real good . Man : ? I came ? ? I saw ? ? He said ? ? He fled ... ? "" ' Forward , the Light Brigade ! Charge for the guns ! ' he said : Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred . "" "" Cannons to the right of them , Cannons to the left of them , Cannons in front of them Volley 'd and thunder 'd ; Storm 'd at with shot and shell , Boldly ... "" I'm glad you came and loosened up a little . Me too . I actually had fun . "" Cossack and Russian Reel 'd from the sabre-stroke Shatter 'd and sunder 'd . "" "" Then they rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Man , I got ta tell you something , but you can't tell a soul , especially my grandmother . Mickey : All right , man . Connell : I got a problem , man . What is it ? I mean , I really got a problem right now . All right . I got this in the mail today , thought you should check it out . Well , shit , man . What are you gon na do ? What do you think I'm gon na do ? Yeah . Come in . May I ? Oh , Mr . Caldwell . Yeah . I just wanted to see how you were feeling . A great deal better , thank you . Well , that's ... that's good . Good to hear . Yeah . Good night . Good night , Mr . Caldwell . Uh ... I got a question for you . Yes ? How did y'all meet ... you and Naomi ? Well ... I was taking my dog Molly for a walk in Hyde Park one morning ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had died a year previously . Molly had become my constant companion , always trying to lift my spirits . I noticed ... a very attractive woman standing by the bronze statue of St . George slaying the dragon . And she had a camera , obviously a tourist . And she spotted me and she asked me in a very attractive Southern American accent if I 'd care to take her picture . Of course I said I 'd be delighted . So she gave me the camera . And I was expecting her to stand in front of the statue and smile . I 'd take a snapshot of her , I 'd give her the camera back and we 'd go our separate ways , but not a bit of it . Not a bit of it . No , instead she absolutely astonished me by climbing on the back of the horse , sitting astride it behind St . George as quickly ... and as nimbly as a monkey . Sounds like her , yeah . I was laughing so much , I had difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I met Naomi . I just always wondered about it . Always wondered . Yeah . Hey , kid . What's up ? Just going outside for a smoke . You ? Just having my cereal . You're up early . Not really . I ain't been to bed yet . How come ? Connell and me were up all night talking . Connell got drafted . Shit . Does Dorothy know yet ? No , he ain't told her yet . Man . Poor thing . She loves that kid to death . It's weird , Daddy . How can government just come and tell you what to do like that ? He was gon na go to California , get in the music scene . - It's fucked up . - I know . it ain't right . I mean , that's why I'm telling you you got ta get in college . That's why I'm against it , you know ? So a kid like Connell that has a dream gets a chance to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool about it though ... Connell being a soldier . No , son . There's nothing cool about it . Jimbo : Well , looky there . Here we go . Nobody else is going to church . Why do we have to ? ' Cause we always go to church . Because we love the Lord . Well , we went to church yesterday . No , we didn't , God damn it . We went to a funeral . It's different . Hello . Hello . Good morning . ? And then the hydrogen atom , ? ? and good things are gone ... ? - Hi . - What are you doing ? Getting the car on ? I'm just fiddling around in here . What are you doing ? Oh . It's hot . - Skip : Yeah . - Very hot . So when are you gon na get naked and recite something to me in your accent , hmm ? Come on , tit for tat . No is not an acceptable response . - Listen , uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . Yeah . Kingsley , you heard of Jayne Mansfield ? - Jayne Mansfield ? - Yeah . Yeah , the film star , blonde with those ... Titties . That's right . That's right . Well , she was killed a couple of years back in a car wreck in Louisiana . And a friend of mine just called from town . They have the very car she was killed in out at the discount store . And they're selling tickets . And it's a big deal . And I darn near forgot it was today . Would you like to come with me ? Come on . All right ? - Oh . - Let's go . All right . How grotesque . it's a good spot . I come out here to do my thinking . I used to bring Patty Overton out here and just wear her ass out . That was before the war . She married a Primitive Baptist preacher . She was hare-lipped and you needed Grandpa's bifocals to see her titties , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God damn , she could take it right up to the gills without so much as a hiccup . Oh , I think she sounds like a lovely girl . Yeah . Right , enough beating about the bush . Let's get on with it , fly boy . I think a little Tennessee Williams would be appropriate . Do you know "" A Streetcar Named Desire "" ? You hear that ? No . I don't . Birds ? Silence . That's what was hard to get used to . It still is sometimes . It's kind of like floating on a peaceful lake with a tornado in your head or something . I never did want to see wrecks . I didn't want to know what somebody's last thought was before they died . I never wanted to see dead faces looking at nothing . I just wanted to fly . When I was a kid , I read books on it . Once in a blue moon one would fly over and I 'd watch it till it disappeared . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren't even in the war at that point . I just wanted to fly up there in the quiet and the still . I was a navy pilot . How about that ? It wasn't quiet and still though . It was loud and crazy and scary . But you went up every time you were supposed to , did what you were supposed to do . And I went up with three minds . One mind was always thinking , "" One way or the other , I'm gon na get back . I'm gon na make it back . "" And then another mind was always thinking , "" This is probably gon na be the last day of my life . "" And then your third mind was right down the middle and didn't think about anything . It wouldn't let the other two in . You know , people say they don't like to talk about war because it brings up the bad memories and the nightmares and everything . I don't believe that . I believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . See , in the early part of the war the Japanese were good pilots , better than we were really . Later on we got better , but ... I made a mistake that day . It was a clear blue day and he got in behind me and I got hit right here and back up there in the back . And I couldn't believe I 'd been shot . And at the same time I 'd been expecting it all the time , you know ? I ... one way or another ... I bailed out . I didn't want to . I was scared to . But I didn't want to burn to death . That's what we were mostly worried about up there . Yeah . You know how lucky I am ? No . I landed right in the middle of the goddamn US marines . It knocked me out . I broke my right leg , collarbone , a few ribs , pelvis , both hands . I don't remember a lot about it , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalcanal . I woke up in a hospital , had both my hands in casts and my right leg , just tore to pieces . And ... the hospital got hit . And I nearly burned to death . I saw a guy coming at me with a big ol ' wet blanket or something and he threw it over my head . I thought he was trying to kill me . But he saved my face , as Jimbo says , for what that's worth , and got me out of there . Carroll got to come visit me a couple of times . That's real special . And that was the end of the war for me . I mean , God damn , honey , you can't get out of your own skin no matter what it is . Anyhow , it takes five kills to become an ace . And I got six . I'm an ace . Skip . Uh , I didn't beat off . Come on , I know a place . Jim : Her and her boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night . The kids was in the back seat , didn't hardly even get hurt . A little ol ' dog of hers deader than Rin Tin Tin . Kingsley : Yes , I can remember when it happened . It's always shocking when the rich and famous die . There's no reason for us to believe that they should have immunity , - but we seem to . - Yeah . Yeah . You reckon how many people would live to ripe old age if we didn't go anywhere , ' cause transportation kills a lot of people . Yeah . What if the last thought in the world was , "" God damn it , here comes a car across the center line about to kill me , ' cause I had to get out at 10:00 at night for a roll of toilet paper . Well , I wish I would have just wiped my ass with a sweetgum leaf . "" Yes , I've been thinking a lot about last thoughts recently . I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in my sleep so there wouldn't be any conscious thoughts ... - Oh , that's good . - ... just a dream instead ... Yeah . - ... hopefully a good one . - Yeah . Yeah . Three , please . Whew . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Move over , son , so we get a better look . Yeah . Mm . There it is . Whew . Mm . Yeah . What they said was , there was ... the car was headed through a road in the swamps . And there was a mosquito truck on the road spraying pesticide . And it comes drifting across the road like a cloud , just this fog of poison . And this tractor trailer rig slowed down when it hit the fog . And Jayne Mansfield's car slid right under it . That was it . That was all she wrote . Yeah . Mm . She was decapitated , wasn't she ? A lot of people think that , but it wasn't the whole head . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kingsley , you spend a lot of your time figuring things out ? You know , Jim , these days I think I spend more time accepting things . Not me . I spend all of my time figuring things out . Yeah . Boy : That ain't her real head . Shit , don't you think I know that ? My daddy says it's probably not even really her car . Ain't you got anything better to do than to pester me ? Huh ? Huh ? That's right . Yeah . - I'll be in the truck . - Yeah . Well , mm , seen enough ? Just about . Just about . Whew . Mm . Mm . Jim : Yeah . A dead man's stare ain't any different than that plastic head's stare . Ain't nothing in either one of them . I saw it on the battlefield many times . I'm sure you did too . Yes , I'm afraid I did . The fact is we all have a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear that ? Yeah . Yeah . I put pieces together all the time and they all fall apart . Before I can ever get it all put together , they all fall apart . Jim : That's it exactly . Everything's been turned upside down . Yeah . Listen , I love my boys , but for the life of me I can't figure them out . Jimbo is a good hand around here , turned out normal , didn't even see combat . The other two was out-and-out heroes , turned out to be hardly naught but hobos . You think it 'd be the other way around . Yeah . Yes , well , I have to say that Phillip has been a bit of a disappointment to me too . Yeah , well , times are changing . Good life's disappearing . Sometimes I pray I'm not here to see it go . Oh my God , do you believe them ? They're acting like long-lost buddies . I know . I'm amazed . Jim : Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsley : it's really quite a storm . Jim : Rest your bones . Vicky : Look at them . No telling what they was up to while we was at church . Jim : Yeah . Phillip : I'm gon na go freshen up . Donna : Well , hey , sister Vicky . Let's take a walk . Donna : We had fun riding . It's about my sister . - Jim : You what ? - Donna : We had fun riding . You need to leave her the fuck alone . Well , now , see here , I don't know what you're getting at . No , no , no , no , I'm ... I'm not pissed off at you . I don't even like you . I only get pissed off at people I like . There's nothing in this for me . This is for your own damn good . Don't get mixed up with her . The power's out ! Jim : See what I got to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ain't a bad gal sometimes . But she can suck you down in the hole you'll never be able to crawl out of . Neal used to be a slim , muscular , good-looking , humble guy . Now he runs his mouth off like a threshing machine just so he doesn't have to hear himself think . And if you look at him , he can't even hardly squeeze into a damn leisure suit , eats whatever you put in front of him , drinks two cases of beer a day . Donna : Like all the shit you done . Jimbo : You want to have some spending money in your pocket ... - Jim : Careful , careful . - ... and not to have to work like a slave , keep your sanity , let her be . She's tricky . She's as whiny as a two-week-old cat . Jimbo : I ain't even sure them's his daughters . Jim : ... stop and see what's going on now . - Jimbo : Get me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They call it free love . It's a free ride is what it is . Kingsley : What astounds me is the lack of respect . You know , the people that we fought and that died next to us ... if they were to see what was going on today , they would literally spin in their graves . It's just a crying shame . While our boys are fighting in the jungle , the hippies are ... they're singing songs and pissing on our flag . Well , don't they realize that there is a rising tide of communism that's going to sweep up onto our shores and overwhelm us if it's not stopped in places like Southeast Asia . Exactly what I've been telling Carroll , word for word . Phillip : This war is not about communism . It's about nationalism . The Vietnamese people just want to be free of foreign domination ... first the French , and now the Americans . Jim : We ain't trying to dominate anybody . We're just trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun ? Kingsley : Yeah , well , sometimes violence is a necessary evil . That's right . That's right . It was my turn in ' 17 . And then Carroll and Skip had to go off after Pearl Harbor . And pretty soon , well , it's gon na be Alan's turn . We need to keep Alan around here . We got ta groom him to take over one of these days . Jim : Well , now there's plenty of time for that . What , you want him to come home with a chest full of medals too , or get killed ? Or both . Hey . Well , I'm just glad I got girls and not boys . Phillip : Don't you think you've had enough , Father ? I mean , you're just a day out of hospital . I've had quite enough of you hectoring me about my drinking . It's one of the few pleasures that I have left . And also I've had quite enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I'm no expert , but I do know something about war . I was a soldier too . Oh , yes . I 'd forgot . Yes , you fought in the glorious battle of Singapore . - The Nips surprised us . - Yeah ? Our heavy artillery was pointed seaward and they came up behind us through the jungle . And we surrendered to a force a third the size of ours ... the most disgraceful defeat in British history . And Phillip was a part of it . It was a botched business , I admit . Yes , well , coward Percival should have been court-marshaled , short . General Percival was a brave and honorable man . The situation was hopeless . The fact is , Phillip , you spent the war as a prisoner , as a mere slave of the Japs , not as a soldier . But I survived when a great many of us didn't . I think I should receive some credit for that . Kingsley : Oh , the will to live is very powerful even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I surrendered because I was ordered to surrender . You didn't have to surrender ! You could have gone off into the jungle and fought as a guerilla . You haven't the faintest bloody idea what you're talking about ! Yeah . I am astonished . What makes you think that you can speak to me in this fashion ? What makes you think you can sit there and spout drunken nonsense and not be called upon it ? Well , face the truth , Phillip . You're lazy and you drift through life and then you blame everything on the war . You're insane . I've never blamed the war for anything . Kingsley : You really do live in a fantasy land . Fantasy ? You are a pompous old dinosaur that's outlived his time . I think those Japanese guards kicked you too many times in the head . I really must apologize . I have behaved very poorly . Don't worry about it . I have busted a few glasses in my day . Jim : Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing , Skip ? I came to see you . Just go put a shirt on , get you some ice cream or something and go to bed . Yeah . You remember me being a kid ? Well , hell yes , you was good one time , so I remember . Yeah . You remember when I was a little bitty kid ? I just said , yes , I do . Now you're my damn kid but , God damn it , I'm going through some business papers . Just get you an ice cream now . Go to bed . You remember any stories about me when I was little ? You remember anything , like one time when you and me had a conversation sometime , something like that ? Anything ? I mean , just some story about me when I was a little kid , you know ? ' Cause , you know , Mama told me one or two last time I saw her . What did she tell you ? Well ... she told me one about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to tie him to a tree while they fed the chickens and put the wash up . Jim : Mm-hmm . They called him Precious . Mm-hmm . Yeah . The power's back up . Put your shirt on . Go find something to do . Yeah . All right . Turn that music down ! Donna . ? Please , fantasy ? ? Please stay with me ... ? I put a shirt on , Daddy . Boy , you sure did , didn't you ? Mm-hmm . ? My reality ? ? Stay close to me ? ? Stay , fantasy ? ? Please stay ... ? Boy , I must have been something else when I was a kid . Yeah . Donna : What are you thinking about ? Phillip : I'm not sure . Well , there's no way it wasn't gon na happen . Doesn't it feel good to live ? Yes . Yes , it feels good to live . Well , you don't seem too happy about it . Don't get all English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that wasn't good . No . No , I can't tell you that . Quit being so weird . You are thinking something bad , aren't you ? It's not fair to be acting so weird and not tell me what it is . Talk to me . I'm just tired , just very tired . Don't make excuses . Tell me . Okay . Those things my father was saying about me , about the war ... I was a prisoner , a slave , but I was still a soldier . God . That's what you were thinking about ? Not about me or about just now ... you know , about us ? You wanted to know . Well , the war's over . And daddies are daddies . They're always yelling and saying shit . I don't want you to think about anything else tonight but me . I'm sorry , but you insisted . No way you could really understand anyway , there's really not . Hey , don't treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you really spend the whole war as a prisoner ? You didn't ever fight ? It depends on what you mean by fighting . Fighting the enemy , shooting , jumping from foxhole to foxhole ... not too much . Fighting to survive every crawling , filthy , miserable , horror-filled minute ... yes . Yes , I fought . Where are you going ? I just want a cigarette . The storm didn't last long . They never do . Probably way off in the next county by now . Camilla : My father's a monster . Skip : Yeah , Daddy's a monster too . - Skip : You watch much TV ? - No . - Hey , Daddy . - Hey . I heard you and Kingsley are going hunting . Yeah . We're gon na go out ... out around Ten Mile Creek . But it ain't hunting season . In my places it's always hunting season . I'm proud of you . How come ? Wha ... ? Because of how nice you've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for 20 years , blamed him for ruining my life . Yeah . - What changed ? - Well ... it started at the funeral home when they rolled him out to the ambulance . I looked at him on that stretcher ... a strange town , a long way from home , just ... his wife just died , he's thinking maybe he's fixing to die too ... and I just thought , "" Well ... "" "" ... that poor devil . "" it was like I wasn't mad no more . What is that ? Ice tea , hon . I made some for your grandpa . He and Sir Kingsley are going hunting . Made some hot tea for Sir Kingsley . Want a sip of tea ? Eh ? Not yet . Not yet . I'm thirsty . There was a Civil War battle fought not far from here , called the Battle of Ten Mile Creek . - Really ? - Yeah .

That was Alan . He's been tripping since last night and this morning put some in Grandpa's ice tea . Why would he do that ? ' Cause I told him . I said it 'd be a good idea . Fucking dude . Actually I've got a very funny hunting story about Phillip when he was a small ... Hold on , hold on . Hold on . - Sorry ? Beg your pardon ? - Hold on . What's ... ? What's happening ? What's happening ? Kingsley : How do you mean ? Yeah . Everything feels funny . A little wiggly . Do you feel a little wiggly ? Jim , are you all right ? Everything's changing ... the ground , the trees , the sky . The leaves like a wave . And ... I don't have any balance . I don't have any balance . Please tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving leaves up yonder , see ? ' Cause I don't know what ... I don't know what's going on or where I'm at . Look , look , we've got to get you back home .

How did you get behind ... behind our lines ? I got a whole company of men right behind that curtain over there , you sorry sack of Hun shit . Drop that weapon ! Jim , have you ... have you gone completely mad ? - Jim : Yeah . - What ? I'm not a German , Jim . It's Kingsley . German Jim Kingsley ... good alias . Is that how you got back here , Mr . Alias ?

Who do you think you's fooling , you cabbage head ? Open your mouth . No , I'm ... I'm English . We fought on the same side . But it's not the Great War now . It's 1969 . So please , please , please put the gun down . Oh my God . Kingsley : Heavens . Jim ! Where's Daddy ? Is he back yet ? He's hunting with the old man Bedford . What's going on ? Alan put LSD in Daddy's ice tea . - He fucking what ? - Donna : Where did Alan get LSD ? Did he say where he was going ? Yeah , they're out along Ten Mile Creek . Okay , come on , come on . Let's go . Let's go . - Get your truck . - Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Daddy ! Hey , Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Carroll : Hey , Daddy ! - Father ! - Daddy ! Y'all , shut up .

Come on , Kingsley . Jim : Get your skinny little ass in here ! - Thank God . Are you all right ? - Yes , yes , I'm all right . Poor Jim has completely lost his mind . Jim : Uh-oh , here comes the police . What are y'all looking at ? Phillip : What on earth happened ? Kingsley : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . Jim : Come on in . I love it . I love it . Jimbo : You got a 70-some-odd year old man out there ! He could have hurt himself ! Alan : I didn't know he was gon na be going hunting . Jimbo : Son , he's out there running around the woods with a gun ! He could have killed that goddamn Englishman ! Alan : Yeah , but he didn't , Dad . It's okay . God . Jimbo : Boy , it ain't about what he didn't do ! It's about what it could have been ! Kingsley : Oh , well . Jimbo : What the hell has gotten into you ? I raised you better than this , boy . Did you think of me ? Did you think of your mama ? What do you think your mama's gon na think of this ? How is he ? Alan : Exactly what I was thinking . - About the same . - ... you had to live with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the drug to wear off . Alan : You don't ever care about nobody but what you want . Jimbo : Son , I'm gon na tell you right now , I would never do that to my father ! I'm glad you're safe though , Father . Jimbo : I would never do that to my father ! I was worried about you . Jimbo : How the hell could you do that ? Nothing to worry about . I've been in tighter spots . Jimbo : You're disrespecting me right now ! You're gon na be grounded forever ! - You understand ? - Phillip ... - Alan : You can't ground me . - Jimbo : I sure as shit can ! - Last night I ... - Alan : I'll just run away ! I think I said some things I didn't really mean . - I didn't either , Father . - Alan : You ain't gon na hit me ! Alan : You ain't gon na hit me ! Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand me ? Alan : I'm going away to Carroll's . Let's just put it behind us and go on . Jimbo : You get your ass up to that room . Get your ass up to that ... Alan : You can't tell me what to do ! - Kingsley : Oh , yes . - Jimbo : I sure as shit can . As long as you're in this house ... - Go on . - ... you're mine ! Alan : Well , I hate this house ! And I fucking hate you ! Jimbo : Better don't come out till I tell you to come out ! My billfold got wet in the creek . Take all the stuff out , spread it all out and dry it . - Okay ? - Okay . - See ? - Where is it ? It were in there . Yeah . Just dry everything ... my license and whatnot ... and that damn letter of yours . - I don't understand . - What ? All these years you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant something to you ? it's not gon na kill you to talk to your kids , Pops . You might be surprised what happens . What's the matter with your head ? Huh ? I can't ! I can't breathe ! I can't breathe ! - Daddy , Daddy . - I can't breathe . Daddy , it's Jimbo . I'm right here . - I can't breathe . - I'm right here . Let's get you up . Come on . I can't breathe . I can't breathe . Skip , don't just stand there . - It's swelling me up ! - Get over here and help me . - I can't breathe ! - Let's take him outside . Come on . It's pretty to look at , but it ain't good fire though ! I can't breathe ! Motherfucker ! I can't breathe ! Hey ! I can't breathe ! - Come on , Daddy . - I can't breathe ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can't breathe ! - Come on . - I can't breathe ! Watch that step , Daddy . - You steady him , Skip . - What's that ? I'm gon na go make some more coffee . All right . Did you need me to hold you up , Daddy ? Uh , hold yourself up . Skip . Yeah . Yeah . You know , there was a ... there was a time when everybody I looked at looked like pigs with hollowed out eyes . And everything was kind of yellow . Yeah . Is that when you was in the war ? No , about 10 minutes ago , or maybe it was yesterday . I'll be darned . Yeah . Yeah . Hey , you see down there where that fence goes along with the driveway , looks like a big rubber band , you know ? Huh ? No , sir . I can hardly see anything out there , to tell you the truth . Well , I was putting barbed wire up along there . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you helping me . And I got all tangled up . I ended up falling , getting all rolled up in it . And it was all stuck in my hair even , my shirt and my pants . And I asked you to help me get out of it . And you started bawling and run off . I said , "" Why , you little shit . "" And in a minute or two you come back just hauling ass , still crying , with a pair of wire cutters . I said , "" God damn , Skip , I done got wire cutters right here . I just need you to help me get out of this . "" You ... you always ... you always panicked when somebody got hurt . You never could see anything get hurt , you never did . Yeah . You said I was about seven or eight ? Yeah . - What are you doing ? - Huh ? What are you doing ? I was just kind of putting my arm around you a little . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Are you wet ? - Wet ? - Yeah . No , sir . I'm ... Do you feel wet ? Jimbo : if we was Old West outlaws ... I was thinking about this the other day ... I 'd be Jesse James , Carroll would be Pat Garrett ... Skip , you 'd be Billy the Kid . Carroll : Pat Garrett wasn't an outlaw . Jimbo : Yeah , he was . He changed his mind and he switched over . How come I 'd have to be Billy the Kid ? Jimbo : ' Cause . Because he was just a dumb-ass who got lucky and killed a few . There's this one picture of him . I saw it . He's lopsided . Looks like he's licking the snot off his nose . What if I throw a low , hard one down there , bounce it up in your nuts ? How would you like that ? Jimbo : I don't think I 'd like that too much . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit . Carroll : Hey , can we take a break ? ' Cause I'm tired of just standing here . I don't know about you . Hey . - What ? - Hey . Oh . One of the dogs has been shitting on the porch . I think it's this damn Penelope . Where did everybody go ? Well , Jimbo's out back someplace there . No , I mean , where's the Bedfords ? Well , they left already about an hour ago . Yeah . - They left ? - Yeah . Well , why didn't anybody wake me up ? I reckon nobody thought about it . Good girl . Well , what did they say ? They said , "" Bye . We had a good time , "" you know , stuff like that . Dorothy gave them some chicken and biscuits to eat on the road . - Well ... - Good girl . Did anybody say , "" Tell Donna goodbye "" - or something ? - Not that I remember , no . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Don't shit over there now . Uh , I 'd better see what Jimbo's up to . Okay . Jim : Yeah . It'll be good to get home , hmm ? Yes , Father . Well , Skip , you finally got some decent pussy , didn't you ? Well , maybe I'm in love with her . What do you think of that ? - What ? - I'm sorry , buddy . I'm sorry , that's just funny for some reason . Hey ... - Nah . - Shit , man , Daddy did acid . - No . - He said he figured out everything he ever wondered about . Then he said that when he puked he forgot all of it . Hey , Jimbo , what did you put in Mama's casket ? I saw you put something in there . It's just something between me and her . Come on , man , what was it ? It was a letter I wrote her and never sent her . Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don't think I never smoked dope before ? What do you think I am , a caveman ? Shit . I just don't like it . It ain't good for me . I start thinking the FBI is chasing after me . My heart starts racing so fast , I'm worried it's not gon na stop till I'm dead . Hey , Jimbo , me and Carroll ... we don't care that you never did see combat , just so you know . We really don't . I mean , you're our brother and we love you to death and you're our flesh and blood , you know . And we're glad you didn't . There ain't no reason to be jealous about it . You don't have any idea . So , um ... you ought to be happy about it . I mean , me and Carroll's proud of what we did and everything , but it's a goddamn nightmare , Jimbo . So you ought to just let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of as normal . Me and him can't , you know . I mean , you see how Daddy treats us . What little sleep I get , I wake up thinking I'm on fire . Now how would you like that ? God damn , buddy , I love you to death , but sometimes , man , you can really fuck up a free meal . Now what did you have to say that for ? I mean , he was actually smoking with us and talking to us . Now why did you have to say that , man ? It just felt right . Here . Put this on your face . Now that's why you 'd be Billy the Kid . He got shot when he was 21 for being too big for his britches and not thinking . You just need to think sometimes before you open your mouth . I do think , Jimbo . No , you don't . I try not to . Hey , hey , let's go get some cheeseburgers and go hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Let's go . You drive . You shitting me ? No . Go ahead . Carroll : Are you sure , buddy ? Yeah . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let's do it . Skip : Jimbo , stop . Stop the car . Stop the car . God damn it . I c ... I'm sorry . I'm sorry , Jimbo , it just don't feel right . Jimbo : Well , God damn it , Skip . Daddy . Hey . What's up ? I went to the recruiting office yesterday when you were over at Grandpa's and I joined the army . The sergeant said they'll keep me and Connell together . Everybody in the family did it , Daddy . I saw this picture of some guys in ' Nam hanging out with some palm trees , with their shirts off and guns slung over their shoulders . Looked so fucking rock ' n ' roll . I want to do something cool , Daddy . I don't want to rot here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? What were they thinking ? ? ? And what were they drinking ? ? ? Were they leaving ? ? With any regrets ? ? ? Were they achieving ? ? What they were believing ? ? ? Did they pay off ? ? All of their debts ? ? ? My head's in the clouds ? ? Anytime there's bad weather ? ? Wondering if storms ? ?

The end is just really ? ? The start ? ? I spend all my time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart ? ? We'll all go through the ? ? portal ? ? Yeah , no one's immortal ? ? But the time and the place ? ?

Yes , please . - We'll fix it or get you another . - He's my bunny . I want to keep it . Sam , I'm sorry . Why Tyrannosaur ? What ? About your wife . Tyrannosaurus or something ? Oh , Tyranno ... Right , yeah . It was ... It was just a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , the movie ? Do you remember there's a scene in the car , the kids are scared and they're looking at the glass and you hear the Tyrannosaur coming ? As it thumps its way towards them , the glass starts to ripple . So , my wife was a big lady . You 'd hear her going up the stairs . And it was like boom , boom , boom , boom . And I swear if I put a cup of tea on the sideboard , you 'd see the same ripples in my tea . So I called her the Tyrannosaur . I thought it was funny . I was being a cunt . - Did you love her ? - Mm-hm . And I hated her as well . She was a simple lady . Had this naive faith in people . Would forgive anyone for anything . Used to drive me fucking nuts . So full of forgiveness and love ... And I stomped the love out of her . I'm not proud of it . I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . - Do you wish she was still here now ? - No . - I 'd still treat her like a dog . - Why ? Cos I'm not a nice human being . I don't agree . I think you're a good person . You don't know anything , girl . I feel safe with you . Nobody's safe with me . Hey there ! How you doing ? Hope you don't mind . I wanted to cook something for you to say thank you for looking after me . And , erm , I've got something in here . Just to brighten the place up a bit and to say thank you . Are you Ok ? Sorry . I didn't want to force it on you . I just wanted to say thanks . You're fucked . Sorry ? I took your keys . I went to your house . I wanted to sort this shit out . I saw him . Yeah . Was he there ? What did he say ? A load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you done , girl ? What ... what's wrong ? What are you looking at ? Who the fuck are you to judge me ? You know nothing about me ! You don't know what that bastard did to me ! He ... He raped me . Oh , God ... He put things inside me . He put glass inside me . I wanted to have babies . All I wanted was to have babies and to be a mummy . Oh , God ! Help ! Please help . Will you hold me ? Will you hold me , please ? No ... Please ... Heavenly Father , help me . Dear Hannah . It's taken me a while to put this together . I'm not so great at writing letters , but I wanted to get in touch . Life's been mad for me in the past 12 months . Been awful sick for a number of reasons . I don't know if it got in the papers to you , but Samuel got attacked by that dog . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggy wound up so much that it turned on the nearest thing to it . Give me that fucking bunny ! It happened to be my buddy's face . Fucking thing nearly got chewed up . I could see it coming . An animal can only take so much punishment and humiliation before it snaps , fights back . That's its nature , you know ? I felt responsible for the boy . But I was trying to turn over a new chapter in my life . Events sent me a bit gaga . And my head just went . That is the second little dog I've killed . I'm not proud , cos I love dogs . But it had to be done to even things up in my mind a bit . Think I went a bit native . That's what Tommy told me . No ! "" You went native . "" My fucking dog ! And I thought that sounded about right somehow . Fuck ! You fucking cunt ! I'll fucking kill you ! I'm gon na fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You sick fucker ! Come on ! Come on ! You wan na go to war ? It was my fucking doggy , man ! I'll fucking kill you ! Come on ! That's my baby . He's killed my fucking baby , man ! That's my doggy . My fucking baby , man ! So I did get a bit of time for it . Got a lot of letters from people who said : "" Well done . Good on you . I 'd have done the same thing . "" But nobody ever does . They all think it , but I do it . That's the difference between me and you and the rest of the world . When I got out , I thought I 'd make a new start . I don't do the drink like I used to . I just decided enough was enough . I put flowers on my Pauline's grave every week . I prayed for you the other day . It's not something I do , but I found I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that shite , as you well know . I 'd like to come and see you . There's things I want you to know . You asked me once about why I went in the shop , but I never told you . I didn't go in there looking for God . I wanted you . Apart from Sam , you were the only person that smiled at me around here . And I wanted it . I wanted it to soak into me and brighten me up . And I thought you were beautiful . I just wanted to look at you , that's all . Didn't want to know you . Because I knew if I got to know you , you 'd have your own shite . You wouldn't be perfect , and I didn't want that feeling ruined . And boy , was I right . Anyway , I'm signing off now . My address is on this letter , so write to me if you feel like it . No pressure . - Hannah . - Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ? Hang up my skin to dry ? We were wasted , son ? We were wasted , all ? On the ride ? From the nightclub to our drive ? All the way we sank ? And from the flat ? Above the square ? We watch our comrades bare ? Their teeth , their souls , their flesh ? We were wasted , son ? We were wasted , all ? On the ride ? From the nightclub to our drive ? All the way we sank ...

I'm not mentioning any names , but I have two wrapped up in the rest home right now . I bet I can guess who one of them is . - Is it ... - never mind . Never mind . Well , don't you let her get away with that . I went to school with her . You know , Lucille , I admire your attitude and I agree with you . What God intended .

Everybody's beginning to see things as they are , aren't they ? Well , some of us , father , are not so much interested in seeing things as they are , as we are in seeing things the way we 'd like them to be . Well , just as long as you 'd like them to be for the old red , white , and blue , it's all right with me . Well , Dr . carver , nobody can ever say that we weren't brought up on those good old American bromides . Well , the bromides can come in pretty handy sometimes , can't they , doc ?

Now , keep us going down there . Doctor , you know in my catechism and cookie days around here , I'm afraid I took you rather for granted . Oh ? But I think you'll be interested to know that I've learned to take my hat off to science and to research . Uhhuh . Well , we fellas , that is , fellas smarter than I am , uncover a lot of things that are new , and different , and progress making . But more and more , some of us are beginning to realize that someone put them there for us to discover . Someone put them there . Yes , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find , kind of like an old-fashioned egg hunt , huh ? To discover something is great , but the wonder of creation ... you know , doc , I follow you . I see what you mean . Columbus discovered America , but he didn't put it here . Of course , Columbus is a great hero to us , but I'll bet you that the Indians weren't impressed with him . Well , how could they be ? ' Cause they were here before he was . Did you ever think about that ? No , father , no , but I will . Well , I'll see you all in the bomb shelter . So long . So long , doc . I'm all ready , Dan . Uh-huh , well , you better be . Been having a little trouble with your father lately . You ought a hear him yak when I'm late . Is that so , mother ? Here's your hat , father . Still active , father ? Well , you're darn right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I , mother ? No , he hasn't , John . Our attendance has doubled recently and we're alert . We have to be . We've been holding some special meetings , son , and every now and then we send out for ... more beer ? No , John . We send out for a speaker , someone whom we feel knows more than we do about what goes on in the world today . We ask a lot of questions and ... and we're getting awful smart awful quick . Were you gon na say something , mother ? Oh , I was going to say that if your father's singing at eleven , we ... father's singing ? Will we be able to get a seat ? There might be a line .

I've been following your career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Joseph's . Oh , thank you , father . Good work , John , good work . And speaking of good work , your mother and her ladies sodality have been more than generous to me . Only last week , they gave me a brand new stove . You should have seen the old one . We had to pay the junk man to throw it in the ravine . Your mother and the sodality , they're always doing things like that for me . That's a nice life you have , father . What's that , John ? We take care of you in this world and you promise to take care of us in the next , huh ? Washington hasn't changed his sense of humor , has it , father ? What do you hear from the other boys ? Well , nothing as yet . Why don't you , um , pull the car around in front ? Sure , all right . We enjoyed your sermon very much , father . Didn't we , John ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ... how you took a little story about the mustard seed and developed it for 20 minutes . It was wonderful . Should we go , mother ? Goodbye , father . Nice to see you . Going to be able to spend much time with us , dear ? Oh , I intend to , mother . Would you mind stopping , letting me off at teachers college , father ? I won't be long , mother . I've been expecting that . Can't wait to see old , uh , Professor , uh , toosis , can ya ? Can't even remember his name . I just want to pay my respects and get his advice on a talk I'm giving to the graduating class at my old Alma mater . Why , John , what an honor . Could we be there ? We 'd be so proud , wouldn't we ? Mmhmm . Well , it's an awfully long trip , mother , and time is so short . I'll send you the speech and you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , take a left at the next corner , father . Do you know that you can fly 500 Miles in 2 hours ? We could fly and hear John . How ' bout surprising him , Dan ? Fly ? You and I ? Everybody flies nowadays . We ought a keep up with the times . Dr . carver said I should be nice to you , didn't he ? Mmhmm . Wouldn't cost too much , would it ? Oh , I should say not . I hear some irishman advertising on the radio every day . ? You can fly any place in the United States ? ? diddle-diddle-Dee- diddly-diddly-doo ? ? and travel by air is much cheaper , too ? ? phone wasuch too-ra-loo-ra-loo ? ? I'll do it for you . But he didn't invite us . We're lowbrow . He'll probably invite his highbrow Professor . But he can have his highbrow professors , ' cause if he prefers the ... what's the matter with ya ? I might ask you the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breaks bad ? I just had ' em fixed . You stopped . I didn't stop , I just slowed down . I had to see what street this was . Well , you must be a stranger around here . Yeah , yeah ... I don't care where you're from , they don't drive like that . Well , we don't have to get in a big hassle about it . You just bent my Fender a little bit there . Well , here's my driver's license right there and here's my insurance card . We don't need to go into all that . Oh , yes , we do . You drive like an idiot . Well , I guess she's right . That's my little wife . How do you do ? Well , uh , no hard feelings . No hard feelings . We'll just forget all about it , huh ? Mother , you shouldn't have waited up ! Wanted to . But I asked dad specifically to tell you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it's kind of like old times . Waiting up for me to come home , isn't it ? I had a little work to do anyway . Now , come on in . Come on in , son . There's your ... your old chair . Sit down , sit down . Take the load off your feet . Yes . Remember how you used to sit there reading all night long and I 'd come down in the morning and find you sound asleep . We still have some of your old books . Oh , mother , I'm terribly sorry about dinner , but when the Professor and I get together , you know , I haven't seen him in a year . You haven't seen us either . He means that we've just been dying to talk to you , too . Why don't you talk to your father for a little while ? I have some ... I'll be back in a minute . Oh , you're wonderful , mother . Too bad that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben and Chuck off . Those two are a riot . Yes , mother wrote me all about it , father . Oh , she did , huh ? Well , did she tell you about Chuck ? Mmhmm . Eight pages , both sides . What's the matter with you , son ? I mean , you seem nervous about something . Is something bothering ya ? Feel fine . Maybe a little tired . Well , why don't you go on up to bed now and go to sleep ? We can talk anytime . Let's talk . I'm looking forward to talking to you , father . Talk , talk . You know me , John . All I know is what I read in the papers . In the local papers , huh ? Well , our local paper's not so bad . Our editor pulls off many a witticism . I'm sure , father . You just thought of one ? Yeah . Yes , he had a ... he had a good one in there yesterday about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he steals the ... he steals the results of next year's election . You know , every day he puts one of those in a little box . In a little box . Did I miss out on something ? Oh , mother . Father still has his sense of humor . You still teaching at the little red schoolhouse , father ? Oh , yes , yes . Still teaching them the same down to earth ... - fundamentals . - That's right . - Dan's been - working on his speech for the legion . He's running for commander of the post . Maybe he could help you with it , huh ? - Who ? - John . Well , I 'd love to , father . You know , add some little colorful touches . Put some bows on it . Why do I want some bows on it for ? Oh , well , father , she doesn't mean that . I think mother means that maybe you 'd like to take advantage of your investment in me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Uh , my subject is , "" where are we headed ? "" Hm , well , where are we headed , father ? That's what I 'd like to know , son . Well , how can you tell them what you 'd like to know ? I've got it . You've got what ? What do you mean ? That's what I 'd like to know is what you mean , father . Where are we headed ? I know where we're headed . Well , good . So far , you haven't said anything yet that's gon na get you any votes . But don't worry , I've got it . It's all here , it's packed with dynamite . Well , it sure is loud . Well , it might be loud , yes . You ought a come over , it 'd do ya good . Here's some of the singing that we do at the finish because we've got one particular song that I 'd love to walk into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full blast . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to your home o'er the sea ? ? to the land from whence you came ? ? no matter what its name ? ? but don't be ungrateful to me ? ? if you don't like the stars in old glory ? ? if you don't like the red , white , and blue ? ? then don't act like the cur in the story ? ? don't bite the hand that's feeding you ? ? Oh , father . Rousing words . Great , father . Oh , I'll read your speech . Oh , gosh , I've got to learn this . We've got ta do it together . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to the land o'er the sea ? ? I didn't get your name , go back from where you came ? ? and don't be ungrateful to me ? ? Mother ! I thought you might like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I thought you might get hungry , stranger . You still eat , don't you ? You're working on father's speech ? Mmhmm . Making a few suggestions . Good . I want to talk to you . Tell me all about yourself , tell me about everything . Can't we talk just a little bit , like old times . Of course , mother , why not ? I don't know . But somehow I just have a feeling that we're not as close this time as we always were . What's happened to my boy ? Well , he's grown up , mother . Boys do grow up , you know ? You're aware of the silver cord , mother . It must be severed , you know . Yes , I was there at the time . Oh , John , let's you and me talk sense . Silver cord , fiddle-Dee-Dee . I ... I don't want to intrude , but we don't have to be strangers either , do we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you got a girl ? Well , sentimentalizing over the biological urge isn't really a guarantee of human happiness , dear . Ah . Now you've got me as mixed up as you had your father . Oh , and speaking of ... you were rude to your father tonight , John . No , I think you're wrong . Oh , no , I know your face , John . I've looked into it too many years not to know it . I know every line . Every curve of that mouth . Been stealing any pennies lately ? You're not going back that far , are you ? You haven't forgotten ! Oh , no . Oh , how everybody thought you were so sick when you didn't go to school . I knew what was bothering you . I brought you right into this room , didn't I ? - Right here . - Yes and I said , "" it's all right , John , I was saving them for you anyway . "" And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden you weren't sick anymore . You've got to begin to accept the fact that I'm no longer a baby . You've got to get used to the idea . You were the gurglingest baby . Well , there you go again . Ah , I used to put you on my knee and bounce you up and down . Up and down . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings on . One shoe off and one shoe on , teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John . And you said , "" do it again , mommy , do it again , mommy . "" Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed ... I got tired on this knee , and I put you on this knee . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings ... you used to wear me out . Do it again , mother . You're joking . No , I'm not . Yes , you are . Oh , I can ... Well , that's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your father . - Oh , mother . - Oh , no . I don't understand . No , John . Not with me . It's me . You remember me ? Oh ... When it gets to the stage where you're making fun of a mother's love ... oh , no , mother . II ... I guess I'm just like all the other mothers . I can't take it . Making fun of my lullaby . Spoiling my memories . Oh , but I didn't mean it , mother . Oh , yes , you did . With all my heart , I didn't . Well , then don't ... don't act "" like the cur in the story . "" ? Don't bite the hand that's feeding you ? You're laughing . I made you ... well , you can still do that , can't you ? Well , if it takes my tears to make you laugh , that's all right , I don't care . Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fender . That's right . Did you come to laugh about it ? Well , no , I , uh , the , uh ... I was playing cowboy and Indians with the neighbor's child and trying to do my work at the same time . What do you want ? Oh , oh , well , it's about that , um , the ... the bent Fender , you know ? It came to a little more than I expected . It , uh , was , um , $18 ... don't choke over it . No , I'm not ... and 70 odd cents . I see , that's why you're here . Well , you know , after all , $18 is $18 . Oh , I know , I know , with taxes the way they are . Well , yes , you have to , uh , make a lot more than ... Well . Your attitude's a little different from what it was yesterday . Well , yesterday , I didn't ... well , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Well , I , uh ... Would pick a time when my husband wasn't here . What makes you presume that it was our fault ? Well , I think that's a rather natural presumption . Oh , yes , Sunday Christian , huh ? Well , I ... I mean , I'm just drivin ' along minding my business when , boom , it's a crash and I look back and then at you . Whose fault do you think that was ? Why didn't you look where you were going ? Look ? You hit me from behind . After all , I haven't got eyes in my rear . No ? Well , I ... I mean , I , you know , I can't ... I can't see what's in back of me . I thought that's what you meant . You meet some peculiar people nowadays . A lot of pettiness in the world , don't you think so ? Lady , there's nothing petty about $18 . It was the 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I don't think we hit anybody else yesterday . Hope you didn't have any trouble at the front door . Well , no , that , um , that was a present from my two sons . They're in the service . Yes , they were here last week . We had a sort of , um , farewell dinner . Well , I ... oh , but pardon me , you want to fight the battle of 18.70 , what is it ? It does seem a little silly to squabble about a repair bill when boys like yours are ... oh , you've got another side . Yeah . Maybe you 'd like to squabble over a cup of coffee . Yeah , I 'd like that . Come in . Bring the bill . I got it . That's what my boys sent me . Well , that's ... that's beautiful . I'm just dying to try it on . Why don't you ? I think I will . That's nice . Mmhmm . Madame butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as sad as poor butterfly . It's , uh , it's only that this was sent from San Francisco . That's a harbor , isn't it ? That's where ships sail from ? Yeah . Well , that was a welcome interruption . Yes ? Cleaner . Yes , it is . Where's Mrs . Jefferson ? Oh , she's , uh , on the phone . I'll take it . Yes ? No , he isn't here now . Who is calling , please ? Uh-huh . Wouldn't you think people would leave their names ? These are my two boys . The one's that , uh ... yeah . Look like a great pair of halfbacks . Yes . This one used to pass to that one . Yes , he 'd fade way back . Oh , yeah , to give him a chance to get down the field . Uhhuh . And then ... Boom , touchdown . You have two fine boys , all right . Oh , we have another son , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has more degrees than a thermometer . I said there was only one bright one in the family . He's brilliant though , really . He's going to give the commencement address at his university . Oh , that John Jefferson . Well , he is ... he's just famous , that's all . He doesn't know it , but his father and I are going to be there to hear him . Oh , that's wonderful . Well , I may be there myself . That's my Alma mater , too . - Oh ? - Mm-hmm . Well , uh , does ... he doesn't live here with you now then . No , he's just visiting . He's in Washington . That phone call , that was for him . Oh . That was long distance from Washington . He has a great career ahead of him . Well , it seems you have three fine sons , Mrs . Jefferson . Mmhmm . God was good to me . Oh , I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You're a wonderful mother . Is your mother still living ? I have a wonderful mother , too . Nothing petty about her . Oh , you shouldn't have done that . You never would have got it anyway . Mother ? Yes , John ? Hi . Oh , you said you 'd be home early . Have a good day ? Mm , fine . Well , my day was ... little lonely ? Oh , I'm sorry , mother . I promise that I'll see more of you . You do , John . You had a long distance phone call from Washington , D.C . Oh . Uh , who was it ? They didn't leave any name . What did he , um , did he leave any message ? It was a girl , John . You've got a girl , John ? Oh , no , mother , it was probably just a routine call from the office . No , it was a payphone . I heard her drop a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call back later . Mmhmm . Where's father ? He's , uh , going over your notes . Oh . Well , I hope I was of some help on his speech . Well , uh , he didn't say ... John ? Father . How's your supper coming ? Oh , fine . Well , I'm sorry that I missed you this morning , father . Well , it was as much my fault as yours , son . I ate in haste , I had to leave . Well , uh , did you find my notes useful ? That's what I wanted to talk to you about , John . I hope you got my points , father , because I didn't want you to be saying things that you didn't mean . Now , you know , I realize as well as you that the legion is a great force for good and caution must be shown to avoid the danger of a misuse of their power . Well , don't you think fighting men can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , father . Well , then what happened to my first line ? We legionnaires must fight to keep the power in the people and if we let the state give us freedom , it also has the power to take it away . You , uh , you didn't find any substitute for that , you just , uh , marked that out with a blue pencil . Put your line back . Darn right I will . Put the wholespeech back , it's all right with me . That's what_i intend to do . I said , "" when the state denies God given rights and regards itself as a source of liberty , freedom is doomed . "" That isn't even your idea , is it ? No , I copied it . What difference does that make ? Copying it doesn't make it right . I copied it right . Just wait there . John . Oh , father , let's not go into it anymore . No , I've ... I've got another subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a talk . A good talk , away from your mother , and it's about you , son . Well , if you 'd enjoy it , father . Well , I don't know whether you will . As I told you , we're alert and we are alert . You just said that . Yes . And you sound to me like one of those guys that we should be alert about . One of those guys , father ? I just said that you sounded like one , I didn't say that you ... ' cause if I thought that you really were , you know , I 'd take you out in the backyard and I 'd give it to ya both barrels . No trial , huh ? Nah , you're off on the wrong slant . And you know what I'm talking about ' cause as your father , I wan na know where you're at it . Well , I can help you there . I'm headed for the bathroom . Wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll go with you . Yes ? Yes , it is . Yes , he's here now . Just a moment . Thanks , mom . Hello ? Yes . Uh , lu , I'm sorry , but I'm going on down to the legion now . Well , what about supper ? I'll eat something when I get home . Oh , but you must have a bite . Well , I'm not hungry . Oh , I'll hurry it up . Now , look , the meeting isn't till 8:00 . You have two whole hours . Well , it'll take me two hours to get my speech back the way it was . All right , see you later , son . Good luck , Dan . Thanks , I can use it . I can hear ya now . Yes . Yes . I heard you . I heard ... yes , goodbye . Oh , I ... I ... I know how you feel , mother . Do you ? I don't understand father's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . With a son like me ? You look worried , John . What , was it that phone call that did it ? Well , it was important , yes , mother , but , well , don't , uh , let's not go into how I look again . All right . I ... I made ... I made a cocktail in case anybody was in the mood . Good , let's keep it bright . I made enough for three , but ... you know , I ... I don't like to get back to father again , mother , but ... if you didn't , I would . He's so troubled , John . You know , when we left you off at the university ... Yes ? Well , um , he was so mad that you 'd rather talk to highbrow professors that he smashed right into another car . Oh , he did ? Was it father's fault ? Well , he claimed that the other fella stopped too fast . Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man came by here today with his bill , but I talked him out of it . He finally tore it up . Oh , he finally tore it up . Well , um , did you ... did you have to do a lot of talking ? Oh , I certainly did . He was downright ornery at first . Well , I turned him into a nice fella . You know , warmed him up with some coffee . Well , you two had quite a chat . Yes , we had quite a chat . I told him about Ben and Chuck , what great athl ... about this fellow , uh , did he ... I was talking about your brothers . You keep wanting to talk about this fella . What's the matter , John ? Does it bother you that I talk too much to strangers ? Oh , no ! It's just that , well , it does seem odd that the fellow would come all of this way merely to tear up his bill . Yes . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . Maybe . Now I'm bothered . I told him about you . He seemed very interested . You know me , John , when I get started about you . Oh , yes , mother . Did you , uh , did you start when I was a boy with a penny jar ? No . I did ... Quite a lot of talking though . Here it is , John . - Hm ? - Remember ? Yes . Oh , my pills , I forgot . What are they for , mother ? Modern science has pills for women of my age , John . For , uh , people who forget where they put ' em . They're supposed to insure us against going goofy . Goof insurance . Oh . I told Dr . carver that I 'd just as soon put my faith in God and what he intended . I 'd go along with science , too , mother , and take those little tablets . What about Moses and the tablets he left us ? With the prescription written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't need any pills . No . I always got my strength from two books , both very nourishing in their own way . The cookbook and the Bible . Remember how I used to trick you into learning this one with this one . I 'd say to you , "" I'll make you , um , cookies , pies , cakes , and jam , if you'll learn Matthew , mark , Luke , and John . "" We had a kind of a deal , remember ? Mmhmm . John , what is the matter with you ? Oh , mother , I've got more important things on my mind than cakes and cookies . And Luke and John . I , um , I've got to make a phone call , mother . Lehigh 2-4-1-1 , please . I'm sorry , mother . Um , what time is your next plane for New York ? Not until 12 ? Yeah , I know , but I've got to get there right away . I mean , I've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . I'm sorry to be popping in on you at this hour , but you heard my announcement about the clothing drive . Oh , my bundle isn't ready yet , father . Oh , I have a lot of things for you , especially now since Ben and Chuck are gone , but I have to go clear up in the attic to get them . Will tomorrow be all right ? Well , I suppose it'll have to be . I've been thinking about that joke that was told me Sunday . You know , the one about everybody helping me in this world and then trying to find me in the next . The joke has questionable merit and if John thinks what I ... he's on the phone . Oh , hello , John ! Hi , father . I'm doing a little work for the poor . John ? What ? I'm trying to help out a few people in this world , too . - Goodnight , father . - Goodnight . Well , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the car and ... well , then how much further is that from your field ? Damn . All right , yes . Bye . Come in . Mother ? All packed ? Yes . I wish I could leave with you feeling better . You could . I'm all right . I listened , John , when your father was saying some awful things to you . Oh , well , that's terrible , mother . No wonder you were so upset . I still am . Well , don't let father poison your thinking . I'm sure that I can clear this up in your mind . Do , John . Father is muddled , mother . He thinks in the past . The world at this point is in a turmoil and muddled thinking like father's certainly isn't going to help . Young thinkers are dreaming of the future , mother , what's ahead of us . Why not ? Go ahead . Our only hope is to learn to live with our fellow man . The globe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . We must tear down our spite fences and learn to live with our neighbors . That's good , John . Tear down our spite fences , love thy neighbor . Go on , I go along with you so far . Good . Now father thinks ... what do you think ? I love humanity , mother . I love the downtrodden , the helpless minorities . Good , John . That's what I tried to teach you . You know by heart that we must labor to help the weak , like Saint Paul said . No one can tell me that an early religious training doesn't show itself . Good . I know everything that you stand for , mother , and what I'm striving for is an intelligent and practical way to bring into existence a new and better ordered world . Wewe did understand each other , didn't we ? Yes . Remember how I pleaded for your education ? How they teased me that you were my favorite . You're part of me and it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a part of you . I had dreams myself , John , of great things to be done . But a wife and mother doesn't have much time for more than put off till tomorrow . I ... I hoped , John , that ... You 'd see that someday my tomorrows would come through , some of them . We talk the same language and we think the same way . Of course we do . But , now , try to understand me . Everything that we agree on , you and I , I warn you , this is liberal thinking . So what ? If we think this way , we're leftists , communists , subversive . That's ridiculous . Well , of course it is , but that's the way father thinks . Oh , he doesn't mean that . Aw , I know , mother . Father's wonderful . And I 'd do anything to convince him that he's so wrong about me . Well , just tell him what you told me , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his head . I ... I want to prove once and for all how ridiculous his suspicions are . I 'd go to any lengths , mother , for your sake . I would swear on a stack of bibles . You would ? Well , it's just an expression . But so expressive . That'll do it . Oh , I'm beginning to feel better already . You know how religious your father is , wait till we tell him . Go ahead . Oh , mother . Go ahead . How does it go ? Oh , mother . I swear that I am not now or ever have been a member of the communist party . Feel better ? I can't wait for your father to come home . I'm a little relieved myself . You can't blame me now . Well , you really were worried , mother . Well , it alarmed me , you know ? You kept talking about this fellow with a silly bill . I thought it had something to do with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? I don't know . I mean , I didn't ... you mean my telephone conversation , my having to leave suddenly has got something to do with this man in the ... yes , yes , yes . Oh , mother , I'm ashamed of you . I'm ashamed . Well , you see , that just shows you what one remark like father's can do . Oh , I 'd hate to tell you what I was thinking . Your brain was racing , huh ? Was it . Well , now , you ... you get out of here . I'm going to get dressed and I'm going to get you something to eat . Oh , mother , no , I'm not hungry . Anyway , I should be calling my cab , you know ? Oh . Well , meeting broke up early ? No , no , I left early . What are you up to ? Well , I was just calling a cab , father . I have to leave suddenly . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , was it ? Did what I had to say in there cause you to ... oh , no , no , father . How was your speech ? Eh , you know that crowd . They , uh , they're not too bright . They applauded me . Where's your mother ? She'll be down in a minute . Will you and I have time to finish our talk ? It'll have to be brief , father , because my cab is on the way . Well , it can be . And if you won't remember where you were , I know where I was . It's your turn to talk , so think over what you're gon na say and I'll see how your mother is . Well , John , I ... Hm . Mm-hmm . Hm . This , uh , this is the Bible that your mother taught ... forgive me , son , if I look a little fuddled ... well , that's all right , father . Your mother just told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . She told me that she 'd heard us . Or heard you , father . Well , anyway , she believes in you . You've made her very happy , son , and I'm glad because I've tried to make things pleasant for her . Dr . carver , he told me ... father , try a little harder , will you ? Because you brought this on by leaping to the accusation ... no , I never accused you . Oh , yes , you did , father . No , I just said that you ... that you talk like a scummy . Uhhuh and mother heard it , so now she's upset . Well , anyway , I hope that this settles the whole thing . I mean , I can't do any more than swear on mother's Bible , so I hope that we can now forget everything that's happened , huh ? I hope so , yes . But , if you were , uh ... yes , father , go ahead . What ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a thing , would it , huh ? A whole stack of bibles . Well , there you go again . I know , I know . Father , open your mind and let this in , will you ? The church , they 'd believe me . The courts , they 'd believe me . Mother believes me , but you don't . Mmmm , not yet . Do you believe in the Bible ? Well , now , father , do you believe every page ? I mean Jonah and the whale ... I believe every page , son . Jonah and the whale ... even the pages you don't understand . I believe in those , too . That's faith . That certainly is , father . You mean you believe in heaven and hell's fire ... I sure as there's a hell do . Listen , son , take the first commandment . Do you believe in the lord thy God ? What about honoring your father and mother ? That's the fourth commandment . Well , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that one . Oh , father . What page was that on ? I don't know what page it's on . You made me do it . What have you done , Dan , what have you done ? You hit your son ! Well , he was just trying to pound some religion into me , mother . He tripped over the table . Will you get out of here ? Dan , will you get ... come on , come on , come on . Oh , please ... get on down to the legion . Now don't get yourself , lu , all excited . Put it on . Yes , mother , I'll put the coat on , but I wish you wouldn't get yourself ... and your hat , now , go on . Put the hat on . Maybe they've got some more beer left . There is . A whole barrel of it . So you're against me , too . Guess I'm just too dumb to get it . No , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . Hitting your own son . No , I didn't hit him , I just merely pushed him ... get out of here . ' Cause he's clumsy . Well , I'll have to go and change , mother ... I know you will ... I know ... wait a minute . Just let me ... let me sterilize it for you . Oh , mother , you don't have to . Put a band-aid on it or something . Oh , that's an ugly thing . Well , I told you that this would happen . I know you did , I know . I just can't talk to him . Well , there's my cab , mother . Here , I'll do it . Well , I've got ta change my pants anyway . And I've got ta catch the plane before midnight . Call a cab ? Yes , be there in a minute . I'll get it , mother . Hello ? Ben ! Well , how are you ? Where are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to pay a visit to mother and dad . Chuck , how are ya ? Hiya , boy . You keep up the fight in the home front , won't ya , John ? Yes , yeah , I'll be in there punching . Well , good luck to both of you . And I'll put somebody on so you can get your money's worth . Hello , Chuck . You in San Francisco ? I got the kimono , it's wonderful . I was a little disappointed though , no opium pipe . She got the kimono . Hi , mom . Hello , Ben . Chuck says you may be leaving soon . I hope you're on a slow boat . Goodbye , boys . Goodbye , mom ! Byebye . They're leaving , John . I won't hear those voices again for a long time . Well , mother , maybe we'll have a lasting peace one day soon . Oh , you fight for that , John , in your way , and say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light two candles for them , I'll light one for you , too . Good . Bye . Now , don't forget you're my tomorrows , John . What's the matter , dear ? Goodbye . Oh , your knee . Oh , it's all right . Soso many things on my mind . What are you gon na do about the trousers ? Oh , they're ruined . Throw them away . Give them to father o'dowd . Goodbye . And you drive carefully now . - So long ! - Or I'll school you ! Good morning . Good morning . I'll fix that . You look like you finished the barrel . People who aren't so bright can hold a lot . Dan , I blew up . I'm sorry I threw you out of the house . That is a commie specialty . - What ? - Breaking up homes . I may not be bright , but I know that . I'll have to talk to you in the morning . John stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but he loves humanity , Dan . He may love humanity , but he's not for his old man . I'm a human being , I'm human . No crying , jagna . Can't stand anybody that looks into the future . You can't even stand . I'm all right . John explained it all so clearly , Dan . You're suspicious of anybody that has liberal views . Saint Paul was a liberal ... leave Saint Paul out of this . You leave the lamp alone . Listen . Let's just stick to John's kind of liberalism , hm ? They just caught one of his kind down in Washington . But you don't mean for a minute to infer ... she knows a lot of people that talk just like our son John . That's the beer talking . No , it isn't . I switched to bourbon . You're in fine shape to teach little children in the morning . I'm not teaching little children in the morning . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s the use of teaching honesty , goodness , love of home and country ? Hm ? Nobody gives a hang . Oh , some mothers are very interested in report cards . Good grades , not character , high marks . Fathers , they just don't care . I take that back . One father did come to the school . He wanted me fired . He heard that I had mentioned God in the classroom . His little son of a ... father like that snitched on me . I must teach his little stool pigeon reading , writing , and ' rithmetic . Just suppose that he gets excellent in the three r's and he gets a goose egg for character . Reading , excellent . But if he reads nothing about his faith , whatever it might be , his head will be as empty as ... as John thinks mine is . Take writing . There's a lot of good writing on bad checks . Forgers have excellent penmanship . Am I boring you ? Oh , go to bed , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit your son . I'll tell you now and then I'll go to bed . I saw red when he said that i made it difficult for him to honor his father and his mother . It's wrong . He honors his mother . And so do I . I honor you , lu . But he makes fun of ... oh . I'm sorry . It's all right . But he makes fun of his father . You saw how he acted when I sang my song . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back ... ? ? Now who's breaking up our home ? If I broke anything , I'll fix it . I just wanted to show you how silly your son behaves . Where does he get his awkwardness ? You know , I've been thinking . I'm not going to quit . I'm going back to school in the morning and keep on teaching little children . Hello ? Yes . Yes . Hello , John . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s too bad your father isn't here so you could talk to him . Well , John , I know how busy you are and this is expensive , but believe me it was worth it , dear . And I hope that your day is as bright as you've made mine . Goodbye . What ? Oh . Your trousers ? Those old things ? Well , I gave them to father o'dowd like you told me to . Why ? Did you leave anything in them ? John , you seem upset . Is that why you called ? All right . All right , I'll get them . I w ... I will . I'll get them this evening . Right away . All right . Your father has the car , but I'll walk over . All right . Well , it was good to get to talk to you , John . Goodbye . What is the reason for this visit , Mr . ? You didn't tell me your name before . Suppose you start right off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jefferson . Federal bureau of investigation . Mm-hmm . No , I won't , uh , take your hat . I have a feeling that you're not going to stay long . Would you mind if I sit down ? I don't care . I'm aware this is a shock to you and I ... I don't want to frighten you . I'm not at all frightened , Mr . stedman . I seem to ... to startle you . Naturally . When you showed me who you are . No , no , even before that . I ... I thought that you looked , uh , you looked more shocked when you saw me than when you found out who I am . Well , suppose you say why you're here and I'll try to have the right expression . It's about John . What's he d ... what do you think he's done ? I'm not sure that he's done anything . Well , you won't be any more sure by talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you anything anyway . Well , you're within your rights to refuse . Were you within your rights when you wormed your way ... that's right , you wormed your way , into my confidence so I 'd do a lot of talking . I know that ... that our methods are very often criticized by certain sources because we're after them day and night . But nobody objects to a firm that protects its business by investigating your credit . Insurance outfits have to protect themselves by thorough investigations . Well , I ... I've always had great respect for you people , up to now . Do you ... you care to answer any questions ? Or not ? Like , for instance ? I 'd like to know why John left suddenly . Well , I know why . He had a perfectly good reason for leaving suddenly . But I see no reason why I should tell you . I know this , though , I'm leaving suddenly . I have a lot of things to do . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things i have to do . You can stay around though , it's all right . Look the house over . Oh , you'll find my beds aren't made . I haven't done my housework yet , thanks to you . Oh . There you are , father . Oh , hello , there ! Did you come over to help us ? I want you to see this . Now there's something that anybody could use . Mrs . mooney gave me that . Oh , the woman has a heart of gold . Father , I want something back . You Indian giver . Well , you know those trousers I gave you ? They're John's and he wants them back . Then he's the Indian giver . Perhaps he left something in them . No , I , uh , I asked him that and he said no . They seem worthless to me . Well , we'll find them if they're here . Here's some of my stuff . Would you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... they were gray . - Gray . - Flannel . Flannel . They had a little stripe in them , I think . Gray flannel with a little stripe in them . There's gray flannel with a little stripe in them , but , uh , that's a coat . Is there any other kind of a hint that you could give me or a clue ? Yes , there is . Here they are . Well , they're not much , are they ? Well , to me , those trousers are a complete ruin . That's what I tried to tell him . How in the world did he ever do that ? Hehe ... he sort of tripped . He had a nasty fall . Well , I don't care who his tailor is , he'll never fix that up so they look like their Sunday best . Well , they're good material though , you know ? Oh , yes , they are good mat ... oh , he could fix it , he could . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . I'll tell you what you could do . You could cut them off right there . Make short pants of them . Oh , I noticed Sunday when I talked to John , he's changed considerable since he wore short pants . But I've always said he was the best altar boy I've ever had . He not only served the mass , but he had sort of a , well , a nuance . He looked good doing it , like a notre dame quarterback . And on the other hand , you'll take Chuck and Ben . When they served the mass ... now look at ya . The minute I mention Chuck and Ben . Goodbye , father . Goodbye . Will you do that ? Excuse me just a moment . Arbie's ? Just a moment . Telephone . Yeah ? She got in , huh ? It looks like it . Well , she'll either come to see me or go to that other place . Yeah , well , there's a nice view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol over here . And , uh , down through here there's a little park that , um ... Oh , you're tired , mother . Why don't you sit down ? Now , tell me , how did you get here ? I flew . No ! How did you get up enough nerve to get on a plane ? Oh , I haven't . You seemed so anxious to have these in a hurry . Oh , but you didn't have to ... well ? Oh , mother , you could've mailed them . I mean , I merely wanted ... the trousers , yeah . Not particularly glad to see me , just glad to see the trousers , huh ? Oh , mother , the trousers . I'm tickled to see you . I'm just ... well , I'm just surprised that you 'd fly all the way down here . Yeah . Well , things work out for the best , don't they ? Here I made such a fuss over these trousers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . You know , when you told me that you had to walk all that way it worried me and I called you back to tell you to take a cab on me , but there wasn't any answer . Oh , I was gone , I ... But there was somebody there . He ... no , I guess maybe he was gone , too . Who ? That man you're not worried about . He came back . As long as you're not worried about him , his name is stedman . He came back . Well , then you brought these trousers down just so you could talk about him , hm ? You know , I've been thinking about him . He could have been with the FBI , you know , on one of those routine loyalty checks . We shouldn't resent it . I mean , after all , it's their duty to investigate and protect us . And they're having to work overtime these days , you know , I mean , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see what you mean , mother . My gosh . But it's amazing , you know , what our weavers can ... Um . Mother , what was that man's name again ? You mean stedman , don't you ? Can't I help you anymore ? Don't deceive me , John . If there's anything wrong , if you just tell me , you know , then maybe I could help . What are you looking for ? Is it a key ? Well , I thought maybe that there was a key in my trousers , mother , and I thought maybe that you might have it . It's the key to my apartment . But , darling , it's of no importance . John , darling , is it of no importance ? Mother , it's of no importance whatsoever . I mean , I lose it so many times . You know , I hate to keep asking the landlady for another . Do you have it ? Yes , I do , I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you back . No . It was to take a cab . Mmhmm . But I also wanted to tell you about the key , too . I feel faint . I'm sick . Oh , mother . I hate to rush you , John , but without you , the committee's just sitting there . Mother , now I'm in the middle of a big conference right now , but I'll break that up and take the rest of the day off , hm ? No , it can't be . Thought that was you and then I said to myself , "" now what in the world can she be doing in Washington ? "" Well , I still say what are you doing in Washington ? Came down to see my son . Please don't ask a lot of things you know already . May I ask if you're going back to see him again ? Yes , I am . He's just going to be busy for the next hour and a half . And I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you have some time on your hands , you certainly picked out a nice spot here . I guess you know that's Jefferson's memorial over there . He called this liberty of ours a gift of God . The words are inscribed on the memorial . That's the Washington monument and , um , the Lincoln memorial . No , you can't see that from here . That's just over there beyond those trees . And then , uh , beyond that across the river is Arlington cemetery . That's famous for those who gave their lives for us . Well , how are those two fighting halfbacks of yours ? Have you heard from them ? They sailed . Now we have to fight on the home front for those two . They're fighting for everything these dead held dear and the living should . Whatwhat are you trying to do ? Fire up my patriotism ? II just want you to appreciate that everything I've done on this case I've done to preserve the things that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson . Do you think my boy is mixed up in this ? Oh , if you thought for one moment . Oh , he couldn't possibly . Did , um , did John ever get any phone calls when he was down at the house ? Yes , he ... you were there . We have this miss carlin down here in the district jail . I think it might be a good idea if you listen to her voice and , you see , you have plenty of time . I have my car up here . I warn you , it wasn't a very good connection . I remember that . So I picked her up after she left you . I felt sorry for her . Had to have our little joke . Couldn't say she was glad to meet me . Hoped she would never see me again . She wanted to make sure that you weren't going to follow her . She'll turn here in a minute . Mm-hmm . She watched you go around the corner . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chances of being followed . Smitty picked her up here in his car . Then carlin's apartment is over here on the left , huh ? That's right . We , uh , we had two hidden cameras outside Ruth's apartment up here . Mmhmm . See , one was hung from the fire escape and we picked her up coming in the hall . Yeah . Look at that . Look at her hand shake . I don't blame her . Mine would , too . She knows now . She had all of her chips on this one son . Got a real problem on her hands now . I picked her up here later in the park , sitting on that bench . The beating she's taken . I'm gon na have to ask her questions . She being a truthful woman , every answer is going to incriminate her son . It's gon na be quite a test . God and country or her son , John . She's headed for the airport now and home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lu ? Lucille ? Hey , lu . What's the matter ? What have you been up to ? What's happened ? I flew to Washington , Dan . To see John . You flew to ... Well , I thought we were going to fly together to see him . You beat me to it . You went to apologize for me , huh ? Maybe you're just a little air sick , dear . I am a little sick , Dan . I had to see John . I'm sorry , lu . About everything . I brought this all on by hitting my own son . Hitting him was just like hitting you , wasn't it , dear ? How could a man be so dumb ? No , you're not , Dan . Look , I know , I'm just not very bright . You never said it truer . You are the brightest and dearest . You've got more wisdom than all of us because you listen to your heart . You're not blinded by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest and clean . Now don't overdo it , lu . See , when you talk like that , you're the one that's not thinking so straight . It's not your fault , Dan . Yes , it is . Lu . Lu , I've been suffering all day long . I'm gon na tell John tomorrow how wrong I was . I'm speaking honestly from my heart . What's the matter , lu ? Would you call Dr . carver , huh ? What is the matter , dear ? I feel ... I don't know . I feel I want Dr . carver , Dan . Well , here . Lie down . We'll cover you up . You know , we'll get Dr . carver . Oh , oh , well , they have no phone , have they ? No , I know , I know . Lu , the doctor's over at the rebners ' . Now , I'll go get him . It shouldn't take very long . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you avoided your father . I came here to find out about you . Why did you leave the office ? We'll get around to that . Oh , mother , you had me worried sick . Yes , mm-hmm . Did you tell father about your little trip ? I didn't tell him all about it . If I had , it would kill him . Or he 'd kill you . He ... I've sent him for the doctor . What would kill him , mother ? I mean , I don't follow . I don't understand . If he knew that the FBI is after you , John . Mother , I thought I explained to you all about the FBI . Now , no more fancy lies , John . You'll spend your tomorrows in a federal prison unless you can explain the key to that carlin girl's apartment . Well , now , what makes you think that I ... because it fits . It opens the door . You mean you went to her apartment ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother , are you out of your mind ? Not yet . You lied to me so much , John , that I had to know the truth . Do I know it now ? Are you guilty , John ? Mother , I'm guilty to this extent . Now , wait just a minute . You see , darling , Ruth carlin and I were intimate , quite intimate . And naturally , I hesitated telling you . Only one ... one sin in the constitution and that ... and that's treason . I don't know what's happened to my morals for the moment , but is ... is that all ? Is that all you have done ? That's all , mother . That's bad . But it's good . That's right . But who would believe it , mother ? Besides you and me . Mr . stedman would believe it . He 'd understand . We could get him on the phone . Well , no , mother , that isn't necessary , dear . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret just between us . But we have to tell Mr . stedman , Johnny , he won't let it go any further . Oh , I'll be so happy to tell him . Mother , have you seen him again ? Yes , he came up to me in the park and he took me to see her . To see ... But I ... I didn't recognize her voice , John . He took you down to the jail ? Well , that's why we can't tell him , mother . I mean , he ... It's his job to persecute innocent people . No , he 'd believe us , John . Un ... unless you're lying again . You are lying . Look at you . You are guilty . Mother , darling . "" Mother , darling . "" Listen to you ! Pleading for love , mercy , all the things you've scoffed at . Now you're asking for mother love . Confess to the FBI , John . You've given up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyway . I'll reach my own decisions , mother . You have to make one big one right now , John . Mother , if you will stand by me , I know that I can show you the light . After I make my speech to the graduating class ... after you what ? Oh , no , you're not . Just because my son has been poisoned , I'll ... I'll not let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . Are you planning to make them over to your pattern ? Made in your image and likeness ? God , help him . Look , before father gets back , please give me the key . The key ? Yes , the key , the key to your freedom . So you'll be free to go on making other young people as wretched as you are . Spreading despair . Oh , disguised as hope . Well , now , uh , mother ? How do you plan to stop me ? I'll tell all I know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I haven't lost all faith in you . There are issues in the world today , mother , that transcend a mother and son . Yes , there are things that are far greater than you and me and we have to face them , not as mother and son , but as individuals . The cord is severed . All right . So , as an individual , I believe in human dignity , truth . Wow , you certainly aren't talking as a mother now . But you're ill , dear . You're talking insanely . Am I ? Within your state of mind , dear , no one would believe what you're saying . And I 'd be forced to agree with them . A woman in your time of life , dear , under a doctor's care , two boys in uniform , a husband , my father , inflaming you with patriotic fanaticism about spies and traitors . John , you couldn't . Do ... do you mean that ... You might perhaps have me put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I want to give him the key . Dan , I can't fight much longer . Is it in your purse ? No , it isn't . What are you going to do , John ? Use force and violence on your mother ? Someday , mother , you'll understand how big our fight is . I do now , I do now . No , you don't . There are millions on my side . Millions on my side . And what a fight you have on your hands . Wait a minute , mother . Don't say a word about this . Why not ? Dan , Dan . Hello , Mrs . Jefferson . Come in , Mr . stedman . This is my son , John . Well , I'm sorry , Mr . stedman , you couldn't have come at a worse time . My mother is very ill . Well , I'm sorry to hear that . But my father will be here any minute with the doctor , but we're terribly worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imagining all sorts of things . No . He came at a good time . He came at a good time . Come in , Mr . stedman . You , too , John . Go ahead . You start it , Mr . stedman . I would like to ask a few questions . Yes , indeed , I am ... and that is if your mother's condition will permit . Well , obviously , it doesn't , I 'd like to ask you a few questions myself first . We gather information , we don't give it up . Mr . stedman , you know that it's within our rights to ask you to leave this house immediately . No , John , this is my house . It has a mortgage on it . You know that , John . We always thought it was such a wonderful mortgage . Maybe , uh , the bank will , uh , come and throw us all out . I 'd like to get rid of this house . It's old fashioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that should give you an idea of my mother's condition . Mrs . Jefferson , I would like to ask you , where did you go after you left ? Oh . You . You take over whenever you want to . Uh , so , after you left me , I ... Could I tell this in my own way ? Certainly . I'll get back to your , um ... All right . I went to a church because I was a confused stranger down there . And a ... a church is , um , a traveler's aide to people who don't , uh , know which way to turn . That would straighten out a lot of people . Oh , yeah . They ... they should try the church . Then they 'd begin to remember things that they've , uh , lost , like honor . My sacred word of honor . Tell people . Tell them about their sacred word of honor . I'll tell them . Mother will be to drum next , singing "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don't talk like that about your mother . There's nothing petty about your mother , is there ? No . You be nice to her , you promise . Promise . I promise . Those ... two two boys of yours , those two halfbacks , they're gon na be marching soon , aren't they ? Yes . They'll sing with us . ? He died to make men holy ? ? They may die to make men free . There they are , yeah . They called me from San Francisco . What fight they had . Do you remember , John , hm ? Yes , dear . Many is the game they pulled out of the fire when time was running out . When time was running out , John . Yes . You never played , did you ? No , dear . I think sometimes it hurt you when your father and I jumped up and down cheering for them . Which you remember that I whispered to you , "" keep on studying , there are other goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ben and Chuck again . They're fighting on God's side now and I'm fighting with ' em . The doctor will be here any minute , darling . You listen to me , John , you've got to get in this game and you've got carry the ball yourself . Well , you're doing all right ... I'm carrying it now , but I want to pass it to you , hm ? Take the ball , John . I ... I don't want to make this last play . John , time's running out . We can't stop that clock . John , take the ball before the clock runs out , John . I'm ... I'm ... I'm cheering for you now . My son John , my son John , my son John ... mother , why don't you go upstairs and lie down , darling ? There's the gun . We lost . That was a tough one to lose . Mother . Mother ? Take him away , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be punished , John . You look a little sick . I ... I used to spank your little bottom , but you're big now . You're big . Mother , darling , will you listen ? Your conscience must be nauseated . The lower you sink , the higher you rise in your party , don't you , John ? Come on , doc . Go on in , doc , she's right upstairs in the bedroom . You know where it is . No , she's , uh , she's right in there . Oh , thank you . What are you doing here ? Now wait just a minute , Mr . Jefferson . A lot's gone on since you left . About John ? Is that Dan ? She's taken an awful beating . Yeah ? I was just saying that we ought to sell this place . Yes , yes , dear . Get rid of it because , uh , it's too much . Right , now just ... just be quiet . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness is in a pretty bad way . Testimony may never be any good now . Well , for the moment , it looks like our case is shut . I'll be in as soon as I can . Right on . Now , try to get a grip on yourself , Dan . How can I with a traitor for a son ? He said he couldn't prove that . How did he happen to let him get away ? He said he couldn't hold him without Lucille . And we won't know about her ... he got out of here before I killed him . Shh , please . I'm trying to get her to sleep . How is she ? She's not going to lose her mind . My own flesh and blood . Doc , doc , you've known me for a long time , haven't you ? Sure , sure . I never , never in my life have I done anything to ... I know , Dan , I know . And she ... And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan ? Let's pray for John . All right , dear . Our father who art in heaven , hallowed be they name , thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , on earth as it is heaven . Give us this day our daily bread and for ... forgive us ... Attention , please . Flight 92 for Lisbon now boarding at the concourse gate number 20 . All aboard flight 92 , please . Hello . Yeah . John ? I understand you're on your way to Lisbon . Huh ? Well , what happened ? Not going . Passenger John Jefferson , the plane for Lisbon is leaving immediately from gate number 20 . What time to make a big decision . Well , do you want to come over here and let me help you make it ? By yourself . Well , John , I don't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Well , uh ... No , we don't make deals . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Judas . Passenger Jefferson , this is the final call . John , does anyone else know you're not going to Lisbon ? Now listen , John , use whatever free will you have left to make your own decision and get over here . All right . All right . What is the deal ? Well ... Do we make out a warrant ? Maybe . Maybe we do . Why , John , what an honor ! Oh , I 'd give my life to make you truthful . I'm cheering for you this time , John . I'm ... I'm ... I'm cheering for you now . Go on , rise to it . You can do it . I mean , everybody has some purpose in life , even Judas . John , I don't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Just because my son has been poisoned I'm not going to let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and break their parents ' hearts . You're not going to tell those young Americans to use their God given liberty to destroy liberty .

Some people would rather he didn't , I imagine . Yeah . Hello ? Yes , John . You finished your commencement address and you want me to hear it ? Well , John , look , I warned you about us making any kind of deals bec ... John . John ! Yes , and someone else can hear you , too . John , get out of there as fast as you can . Take Pennsylvania Avenue . Is there someone that 'd rather you didn't get there ? I think we're being followed . We'll soon find out . Hold on , mister . Well , at least the driver wasn't hurt . Hey , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Mr . stedman . They got me . Yeah , I know who . Try not to move , John , the ambulance will be here in a minute . I'm sorry . I wanted to make a speech to the graduating class . Where is it , John ? Do you have it ? I haven't got it . It's in my office . I made a recording . A recording . I'll get it . I'll get right over there . If I think the students should hear it , they'll hear it . I might add that , um , he was to have been given the honorary degree of doctor of laws this day . So the , um , speech was found in his office by the federal bureau of investigation . You will now hear it verbatim as recorded by John Jefferson , class of 1941 . Members of the graduating class and their fathers and mothers . I mention your parents because I address you as representing their tomorrows . Sometimes this day is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , it will be both , but my life will be altogether different from yours . By now , a plane has arrived in Lisbon . It would have carried me far beyond the laws of my native land , but no plane , no means of transportation , nothing can take a man away from himself . He lives with himself day and night . His conscience lives with him , its voice will not be stilled . Mine warned me that I would not be free in Lisbon , that I would only find my freedom here . So here I stand . Hardly believing that but a few years back i sat down there in my cap and gown , like all of you . I looked like you then . I felt like you feel today , ready to go forward , full of zeal , full of purpose . I was going to help make a better world . I was flattered when I was immediately recognized as an intellect . I was invited to homes where only superior minds communed . It excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't have dreamed of when I lived at home . A bold defiance of the only authorities my church , and my mother and father . I know that many of you have experienced that stimulation . But stimulants lead to narcotics . As the cellar of habit forming dope gives the innocent their first inoculations with a cunning worthy of a serpent . There are other snakes lying in wait to satisfy the desire of the young to dedicate themselves to something positive , to give their existence purpose . And the lure is to every young American's sense of justice , their love of fair play that makes all decent men rebel against the evil forces that exploit the weak . With the purest and noblest motives , we eagerly embrace an organized , definite , and active movement to alleviate the suffering all around us . Our beautiful liberalism is now aroused and we have faith in ourselves , our comrades . Somewhere along the line , our brain has been numbed so that we have substituted faith in man for faith in God . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . They have observed your abilities and seen qualities that I once possessed . It's too late to save me . It is not too late for you to save yourselves . No one warned me as solemnly as I am warning you now . Hold fast to honor , it's sacred . No one tried to live the part they wrote for me more than I did . But living it with no spiritual compass , i lost all sense of direction . Any means justified their ends . Shameless falsehood , self-abasement , treachery . And before I realized the enormity of the steps i had taken , i was an enemy of my country and the servant of a foreign power . Now you know that the honor conferred upon me in this citation is false . Every word in it is a lie because I am a living lie . I am a traitor . I am a native American communist spy . And may God have mercy on my soul . There is another paper waiting for me , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my proper degree and this is also my commencement day , the beginning of a new life , so help me , God . There's their chapel . Uhhuh . Let's pray for John , hm ? There was a lot of good in what he said . Some of those ... yes , let's hope they forget what he did . And pray they remember what he said today . Yes .

One time slot in case The Honorable Minister for Education Decides to show up this year . Brent , I suppose you propose The city versus country football match ? Absolutely .

What ? What ? Oh , it's good . It's good . It's really , it's great . What were you going to say ? Ah , nothing . But just that , um , Didn't you say that your students were Aboriginal ?

How would you guys like to perform at NAIDOC week ? Are you serious ? CHALMERS : Mm-hmm . Do you think we'll be good enough , Miss ? Well , it's going to take a lot of work . And we're really going to have to trust each other , So it's your call . I'm willing to put in the work . What do you think ? You want to do this ? ALL : Yeah . Is it a custom ? Ay , marry , isn't , But to my mind , though I am native here . To the manor born it is a custom . Suit the action to the word , the word ... CHALMERS : All right , take five . So who can tell me what subtext is ? Dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It's the most important question A performer has to ask themselves . What do these words really mean ? What is this character really trying to say ? For example , what if I walk into the room And I say , "" Good morning , class "" ? The subtext determines how I say good morning . So what if I say , ( Glumly ) "" Good morning , class . "" What do I mean ? You're sick ? Right , or I don't want to be here . What if I say , "" Good morning , class ! "" What's my subtext ? You've dropped an E ? That's right , Joseph , Or I'm trying to inspire you guys . We use subtext all the time . The same with artists and musicians .

In fact , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , really . Think about it . He used poetry , Rhyming couplets to express himself . His rhymes were a social commentary , Just like Shakespeare's .

"" Okay , Liam , read the last two lines of the scene we just did . Sit still my soul . Foul deeds will rise . All the earth overwhelm them to man's eyes . CHALMERS : Drew ? When my mama ask me , will I change , I tell her yeah , But it's clear I'll always be the same until the end of time . * So take , these broken wings * * I need your hands to come and heal me once again * You Steve ?

( @bell_ringing ) There's a full read-through tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey . Are you doing anything this afternoon ? Uh , no . Why ? Got a read-through tomorrow . Just wondering if , I don't know , we could go over some stuff ? Fortinbrass has my dying voice . So tell him , with the occurrents more and less . Which have solicited , The rest is silence . Now cracks a noble heart . Good night , sweet prince . And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest . What happens now ? You're dead . You know your lines all right . You're a freak . It's weird , eh , how much you remember from when you're little . What do you mean ? Oh , I used to listen to my uncle reads his lines Over and over when he did Hamlet . They rehearsed just across the water . All that for his dad , hey ? Oh , he didn't have much choice , but . What do you mean ? You know , duty and stuff . Don't know if I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What ? Dying for him ? It's not like it's going to bring him back . Besides , he wouldn't want me to . How do you know ? Because I know he loves me . I found out where Barry Griffen's living . Yeah ? Eastern suburbs . I'm gon na pay him a little visit , and I need you there . There's talk of another riot coming up . That's our chance . While the cops have their hands full here ... Bang . What about Dad ? This is for Dad , you dickhead . Dad and Uncle Charlie . We got ta show ' em ... we're still in charge . Then what do you need me for ? To drive . You won't even be in the house . I don't have a license . We're gon na go shoot this fucker , And you're worried about not having a license ? Jase might come too , But I don't what no one else knowing nothing ' , okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license . You got a black_fella's license , don't ya ? Take up the bodies . Such a sight as this becomes the field , But here shows much amiss . Go , bid the soldiers shoot . Okay , what do we think of the end of the play ? CASEY : It sucks . It totally sucks , but that's what makes it a tragedy . And what about Hamlet's state of mind ? Do you guys think he was really mad , or insane ? He ... he pretends to be mad so no one suspects him . Maybe . Or maybe so he doesn't have to take action at all . Wasn't it only when Laertes wanted to fight Hamlet That he was forced to respond ? Liam ? In Act 3 , the King says , "" Madness in great one's should not unwatched go . "" What does he mean by this ? There's a reason for him being mad . And the king knows it . That's why Shakespeare has lasted all these years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a deadly MC , Miss . Open to interpretation . CHALMERS : That's exactly right . Or any great work of art . It's through art that we can escape , That we can experience a sense of freedom . People use art to try to effect change . Shakespeare used the theater To express his view on Morality , beauty , politics . Other artists use music , Photography , painting , Even movies . Okay , today , I want each of you to write a letter To someone important in your life , A special guest that you 'd like to invite To come and see our play , okay ? It can be anyone , sports star , a politician , your mom , dad . I'm going to write to the Minister for Education as my special guest .

Stay right here by the car . And don't tell everyone my business . Mr . Werthan ? Yes , sir , it's me ! Guess where I'm at . I just drove your mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , but she's all right . She's in the store . Oh , Lord , she just looked out the window and seen me . She'll probably throw a fit right there at the check-out counter . Yes , sir . You are right about that . It only took me 6 days . Same time it took the Lord to make the world . Yes , sir . All right . ' Bye . Hey Oscar , Junior . How you old boys doing today ? How the lady been treating you ? I'll tell you one thing ; she knows how to throw a fit . What's so funny ? Nothing , Miss Daisy . We just carrying on . Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning here for 15 years . Never carried on before ! Leave them alone . Put your coat on . We're late . Idella , I'm gone now . I'm right behind her . Hear , oh Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one . Such a nice man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I can get it myself ! Hurry out of here ! Is something wrong , Miss Daisy ? Something I done ? Yes . I haven't done anything . You parked the car right in front of the temple , like I was the Queen of Romania . Everybody saw you ! I said to wait for me in back . Yes , Ma'am , but I was just trying to ... There were two chauffeurs right behind me . You made me look like a fool . A g.d . fool ! Oh , Miss Daisy , Lord knows you ain't no fool ! Slow down ! Miriam and Beulah , I could see what they were thinking when we came out . What's that ? That I was pretending to be rich ! - You is rich . - No , I'm not ! Nobody can say I put on airs . On Forsyth Street we made many meals of grits and gravy . I have done without plenty of times . Miss Daisy , if I was to ever get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around for everyone in the world to see . That's vulgar ! Don't talk to me ! Never understand some white folks . What was that ? ! I heard that ! Now , Miss Daisy ... you needs a chauffeur and Lord knows I need a job . So why don't we just leave it at that ? Good morning , Mama . What's the matter ? No , I don't always think something's wrong when you call . Just when you call so early . What ? ! All right . I'll be there as soon as I can . I better get on over there . ' Bye . Come on . It's not healthy to rush like this . I eat too much , anyway . Besides , it sounds like she needs me . When doesn't it ? Give Mother Werthan my love . Coffee , Katie Bell ! I didn't expect to find you in one piece . I wanted you to be here when he comes . I wanted you to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s stealing from me . Hoke ? Are you sure ? I don't make empty accusations . I have proof ! This ! I found it hidden in the garbage under some coffee grounds . - He stole a can of salmon ? - Here it is ! I knew there was something funny . They all take things , you know . So I counted . The silverware first . Then the linen napkins . And then I went into the pantry . And the first thing that caught my eye was a hole behind the lima beans . And I knew right away . There are only 8 cans of salmon . I had 9 ! 3 for $1 on sale . Very clever , Mama . I missed my breakfast and I'm late to a meeting for a 33c can of salmon ? You want 33c ? Here's $1 ! Here's $10 ! Buy yourself a pantry full of salmon ! Why , Boolie , the idea ! Waving money at me like that ! I don't want money . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it was mine ! I leave him plenty of food every day . I tell him exactly what it is . Like children . If they want something , they just take it ! He'll never admit this . "" No , "" he'll say , "" I don't know nothing about that ! "" I don't like it ! I don't like living with no privacy . Go ahead , defend him . You always do ! I give up ! You want to drive again , arrange your own insurance . Take the trolley . Buy yourself a taxicab ! Anything you want ! Just leave me out of it ! Why , Boolie ! What's he doing here this time of morning ? Can't be good , I promise you that ! I think it's fixing to clear up out there ! Excuse me , Mr . Werthan . Y'all busy ? We have to have a little talk , Hoke . All right , just let me get out of my coat . Yesterday , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon . Now I know you said to eat the leftover pork chops . Well , they were kind of stiff . So , I stopped by the Piggly Wiggly and got you another can . Do you want me to put it on the shelf ? Yes , thank you , Hoke . Be right with you , Mr . Werthan . Well , I got to get dressed now . Good-bye , son . You know , Miss Daisy , I was just thinking . We been out to this cemetery 3 times this month already . It ain't even the 20th yet . It's good to come in nice weather . Yes , ma'am . You sure right about that . Sure is . Mr . Sig's grave is mighty well tended . I think you're the best widow in the State of Georgia . Boolie's always pestering me to have the staff here tend to this plot . "" Perpetual care , "" they call it . Well , don't you do it ! It's right to have member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that ! Boolie will have me in perpetual care before I'm cold . Miss Daisy , you ought to go on away from here ! Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave . Leo Bauer . Is that Miss Rose Bauer's husband ? She asked me to bring it out here . Where is his grave at , Miss Daisy ? I'm not exactly sure . I know it's two rows over that way . You'll see the headstone , "" Bauer . "" What's wrong ? Nothing wrong . Nothing the matter at all . Now , you say ... I told you it's two rows over that way . It says "" Bauer "" on the headstone . What that look like ? What are you talking about ? I'm talking about I can't read , ma'am . What ? ! I can't read , Miss Daisy . You look at the paper all the time . Well , that's just it . I just be looking ! I try to dope out what's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , ma'am . I know my ABC's . I just can't read . Stop saying that ! You're making me mad ! If you know letters , then you can read . You just don't know you can read . I taught some of the stupidest children God ever put on this earth . And they all could read enough to find a name on a tombstone . The name is "" Bauer . "" "" Bauer ! "" What does that "" buh "" letter sound like ? - B ? - Of course ! "" Er . "" That is the last part . "" Bauer ! "" What letter sounds like "" er "" ? R ! - So the first letter is ... - B ! And the last letter ? R ! B-R . Brr . It even sounds like Bauer , doesn't it ? It sure do , Miss Daisy ! It sure do ! - That it ? - That's it . - What about the middle ? - Not right now . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . R at the end . B ... R . That's it . That's all right ! I sure do appreciate this ! Don't be ridiculous ! Let's get all this back in the car . I'm burning up . Of course I told you ! Of course I told you ! How can I be expected to buy it if you don't write it down ? ! I'm sorry , Miss Florine . I need you . I'll be right there . Do you have any idea what it takes to give a Christmas reception ? It takes an eye for detail . I told you a million times , Katie Bell , write it down ! More I can not do ! We are out of coconut . I'm sure we can manage . - I told her . - You didn't write it down ! I don't need to stand and listen to excuses on Christmas . You figure out how to serve ambrosia to 50 people without coconut . I give up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the end of the world . Everybody's giving the Georgia Power Company a merry Christmas . Bet Miss Florine beat them all , especially with the new house . Absurd ! If I had a nose like Florine , I wouldn't say , "" Merry Christmas "" to anybody . I enjoy Christmas at their house . No wonder . You're the only Christian in the place . They got that new cook . Florine never could keep help . Of course , it's none of my affair . Too much running around . The Garden Club this the Junior League that . As if they 'd give her the time of day . She 'd die before she 'd fix a glass of iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood . I hope she doesn't take it into her head to sing this year . Lord have mercy ! Look what Miss Florine done . If her grandfather , old man Frietag , could see this . What is it you say ? I bet he 'd jump out of his grave and snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Miss Daisy , you go on away from here . Wait a minute . This isn't a Christmas present . You know I don't give Christmas presents . I happened to run across it this morning . Well , go on , open it . Look at that . Ain't nobody never gave me no book before . "" Zaner Method Writing . "" I always taught out of these . I saved a few . It's faded , but it works . If you practice , you'll write nicely . But you have to practice . I taught Mayor Hartsfield out of the same book . I sure do thank you . It's not a Christmas present . Jews have no business giving Christmas presents . You don't have to go yapping about this to Boolie or Florine . This is between you and me . Merry Christmas , Mother Werthan . I hope I don't spit up . Merry Christmas , Mama . Hoke . She fought me on this one . But it is time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . No , sir , I don't expect I'll miss it that much . Come on , you're the only one who's driven it all this time . Won't you be a little sorry to see it go ? It ain't going nowhere . I done bought it . You didn't . I sure did . Already made the deal with Mr . Red Mitchell . How much ? That is for him and me to know . Hey , Boolie ! Got a gem here . Got that paper , Hoke ? I got it right here . Be right there . Why didn't you buy it from Mama ? Would have saved money . No , sir . Your mama is in my business enough as it is . I ain't studying about making monthly payments to her . She is mine the regular way . The Hudson's a good car . Nobody knows that better than you . Best that ever come off the line . And this here new one , if Miss Daisy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one . Mighty nice of you . We do what we can . It is three after seven . Yes , Ma'am . You said we were leaving at fifteen to eight . At the latest , I said . What business you got dragging this mess out of the house by yourself ? Who was here to help me ? Lord have mercy ! It don't take more than 5 minutes to load this car . You're fixing to break your arms and your legs before we even leave the manor . You're taking on too much . I hate doing things at the last minute . What you talking about ? Been ready to go for a week and a half . - Give me that package . - No , don't touch that . It sure is pretty . Is that Mr . Walter's present ? Yes . It's fragile . I'll put it on the seat . You nearly missed us . You were leaving at quarter of . - She's taking on . - Be still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it's not a snake ! I think it's notepaper . How appropriate . Uncle Walter can't see . Maybe it's soap . How nice that you take an interest in your uncle's 90th birthday . Don't start up with me , mama I can't go to Mobile with you . I have to go to New York for a convention . The convention starts Monday . And I know what else I know . Leave Florine out of this . She ordered those tickets 8 months ago . I'm sure "" My Fair Lady "" is more important than your relatives . Those Christians will be impressed . I can't talk to you when you're like this . - We're expected in Mobile for supper . - You'll be there . - How will you stand her all day ? - They'll fix crab . All that trouble . She's just worked up . Here's $50 in case you have trouble . Don't show it to Mama ! - Have you got a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It's 7:16 ! You should have a job on the radio announcing the time . - I want to miss rush hour . - You will . Congratulate Uncle Walter for me and kiss everybody in Mobile . The air conditioning did you check it , like I said ? I got the air conditioning checked . I don't know why . You never let me turn it on ! Hush up ! Good luck ! Good God ! Turn left . No , right ! Turn right ! Did I ever tell you about the first time I left Georgia ? When was that ? A few minutes back ! Go on ! My daughter is married to a Pullman porter . She is always on the go . New York , Detroit , St . Lois . I say , "" That's all well and good , Tommie Lee but I don't feel the need for it . "" So here it is . The first time . And I might tell you , Miss Daisy Alabama is not looking like much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff yourself good . I was thinking about the first time I went to Mobile . It was Walter's wedding : 1888 . 1888 ! You were nothing but a little bitty thing . I was 12 . We went on the train . Oh , I was so excited . I 'd never been in a wedding party . I had never seen the ocean . Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico , not the ocean , but it was all the same to me . I asked Papa if it was all right for me to dip my hand in the water . And he laughed because I was so timid . And then I tasted the salt water on my fingers . Isn't that a silly thing to remember ? No sillier than most of what folks remember . Boy ! What are you doing with this car ? This is my car , officer . Can I see your registration , please , and your license , boy . What's this name ? Wertheran ? Werthan . Never heard that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . German derivation . Thank you , ma'am . An old nigger and an old Jew woman riding down the road together . Now that is one sorry sight . Oh , my God ! The sign says Phenix City 30 miles . We're not supposed to go to Phenix City ! Oh , my God ! Maybe you read it wrong . I didn't . Stop the car . Stop the car ! Lord have mercy . Here . You took the wrong turn at Opelika . You took it with me , Miss Daisy . And you got the map . I was getting the lunch ! Go on back . My God ! It ai nt ' more than 30 minutes since we turned . They fixed crab for me . Minnie always fixes crab . They go to so much trouble . It's all ruined by now . We going to have to pull over . What's wrong with the car ? There ain't nothing wrong with the car . I got to be excused . I got to go make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service station . You know colored can't use the toilet at any service station , Miss Daisy . There's no time to stop . We'll be in Mobile soon . You can wait . No , ma'am . - I told you to wait ! - I heard what you said . How do you think I feel having to ask you can I go make water like I am some child . I 'd be ashamed . I ain't no child , Miss Daisy . And I ain't just a back of the neck you look at while you go where you got to go . I am a man . I'm near 70 years old . And I know when my bladder's full . Now I'm going to get out of this car and go over there and do what I got to do . And I'm taking the key with me , too . Now that's all there is to it ! Hoke ! Hoke ! Hoke ? You all right , Miss Daisy ? Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s Boolie . How you doing ? Congratulations on your dad's big day . Thank you , Boolie . Thank you . Aunt Daisy ! It's Boolie on the phone . Hey , son ! Uncle Walter appreciates your call . I don't think he can come to the phone . Fine . How's Hoke ? What do you mean ? How should he be ? Happy birthday , Uncle Walter . I got to hang up now , Boolie . Yeah , I'll tell him . For he's a jolly good fellow . Which nobody can deny ! Morning , Miss McClatchey . Well , good morning to you . Can I see him ? It's Mr . Sinclair Harris , sir . My cousin Sinclair ? His wife ... The one that talk funny . She's from Canton , Ohio . She's trying to hire me . - What ? ! - Yes , sir . She said : "" How they treating you down there , Hoke ? "" You know how she sound , like her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs . Harris , just fine , thank you . "" She said , "" Well , you looking for a change , you know who to call . "" I'll be damned ! I thought you ought to know about it . I'll be goddamned . Ain't she a mess ? Said , "" Name your own salary . "" I see . And did you ? Did I what ? - Name your own salary ? - Go away . What you think I am ? I ain't studying working for no trashy something like her . But she got you thinking , didn't she ? Well , sir , you might say that . Name your salary . That's exactly what she said . Well , how does $65 a week sound ? Sounds pretty good , sir . Course , $75 sounds better . It sure does ! Beginning this week . That's mighty nice of you . I sure appreciate this . Thank you . You ever have folks fighting over you ? No . It sure feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mah jongg . You are the luckiest thing , Beulah ! Excuse me . I don't know how you can look at that . See it a few times , you get in it . Both your brains are fixing to evaporate . You can bring the cake now , Hoke . Don't make a mess with those peas . Do I ever ? Lord have mercy , look at that . Ain't she got a lot of hair ? How she get it so shiny ? Washes it in mayonnaise . - Go on away from here , Idella ! - Yes , she did . I read it in Life magazine . Don't seem human , does it ? He will tear you to shreds ! I am not going into that court . And I'm not giving in ! You are at the end of your rope . You murdered Carlson . You have to pay ! Either choose the easy way out , or you go into the courtroom and let them carve you into pathetic little bits . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? She up to something , ain't she ? - You fixing to ruin it . - What are you talking about ? You got the chicken too close together and the fire is too high . Mind your business . It's your chicken . Thank you , Hoke . Now you enjoy it . Amen . Who is it ? Morning , Miss Daisy . What in the world ... ? I learned how to drive on ice when I delivered milk for the dairy . Ain't nothing to it . Other folks are banging into each other like they're in the funny papers . I figured your stove was out , so I stopped by the Krispy Kreme . I know you got to have coffee in the morning . How sweet of you , Hoke . We ain't had any good coffee around here since Idella passed . I can fix her biscuits . We both can make her fried chicken . But nobody can make Idella's coffee . Ain't that the truth ? Idella was lucky . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m just going to take these things off . I don't know what you can do here today , except keep me company . Then I'll see if I can make us a fire . Eat anything you want out of the ice box . It will all spoil , anyway . And wipe up what you tracked onto my floor . What do you think I am , a mess ? Mama , I'll be right out when I can get down my own driveway . Stay home , Boolie . Hoke is here with me . How 'd he manage that ? He's very handy . I'm fine . I don't need a thing in the world . Hello ? I have the wrong number . Mama's saying loving things about Hoke . I didn't say I love him . I said he was handy . Honestly ! Are you trying to irritate me in the middle of an ice storm ? Thank you , Wellborn . Thank you all . I am deeply grateful to be chosen 1966 Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor I've seen bestowed on mighty fine fellows . And one I never expected would come to me . I'm afraid that my loss up here and my gain down here have given me an air of competence that I don't possess . I will tell you that I wish my father and grandfather could see this . About 72 years ago , they leased an old mill up on Decatur Road with I believe 25 looms in operation . They managed to grow with Atlanta . And Werthan Industries believes that what we want is what Atlanta wants . And this award proves that we were right . I thank you . Well ? What is it ? What took you so long ? I couldn't help it . There's a big mess up yonder . What's the matter ? I might as well not go to temple at all ! No , ma'am , you ain't going to get to the temple this morning , Miss Daisy . Why not ? What's the matter with you ? Somebody has bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s how come we stuck here so long . I don't believe it ! That's what the policeman just said . Oh , my God . Was anybody there ? Were people hurt ? I don't know . He didn't say . Who would do such a thing ? You know good as me , Miss Daisy . It always be the same one's . I remember one time back down there in Macon . Lord , I couldn't've been more than 10 or 11 years old , I reckon . I had this friend named Porter . One day there his daddy was hanging from a tree . Now just the day before , we 'd all been pitching horseshoes . Laughing and carrying on and talking about how me and Porter was going to have strong right arms , just like him . Lord , there he was . Hanging up yonder in the tree . Had his hand tied behind him . Flies was all over him . I tell you , I threw up where I was standing . You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you tell me that story ? Lord , I don't know , Miss Daisy . That mess back there put me in mind of it . Ridiculous ! The temple has nothing to do with it ! Yes , ma'am , if you say so . We don't know . Maybe that policeman wasn't telling the truth . Why would he go and lie about a thing like that ? You never get things right ! Miss Daisy , somebody done bombed that temple and you know it ! I don't want to hear anymore about it ! - You the boss . - Don't talk to me ! - Where are you ? - Up here ! Hello , Mama . How are you feeling ? Not a good question to ask somebody nearly 90 ! Well , you look fine . It's my ageless appeal ! Miss McClatchey gave me your message . Florine is invited , too . Thank you . I guess Hoke should drive us . There'll be a crowd . Mama , we have to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . I believe Martin Luther King has done some mighty fine things . If you don't want to go , why don't you just say so ? I want to go ! You know how I feel about him . Of course , but Florine ... Florine has nothing to do with it . I still have to do business here . I see . Werthan Bag will go out of business if you attend the King dinner . Not exactly . But a lot of men I do business with would not like it ! They might snicker a little . Call me Martin Luther Werthan behind my back . Maybe I wouldn't hear about meetings at the Club . Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills , he's a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew . All the really smart one's come from New York , don't they ? Some might throw their business to Jack instead of old Martin Luther Werthan . I don't know . Maybe it wouldn't happen . And sometimes that's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seats , somebody else will . If we do not use those seats ? I'm not supposed to go , either ? You can do whatever you want . Thanks for your permission . Can I ask you something ? When did you get so fired up about Martin Luther King ? Why , Boolie ! I've never been prejudiced in my life and you know it . Then ask Hoke to go with you . Don't be ridiculous . He wouldn't go . Ask him and see . All right ! Boolie said the silliest thing the other day . What did he say ? He was talking about Martin Luther Ling . I guess you know him , don't you ? King ? No , ma'am . I don't know him . I was sure you did . But you've heard him preach ? Yes , Ma'am , same way you have . On the TV . I think he's wonderful . - What you getting at ? - It's so silly . Boolie says you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that ? No , I didn't . I didn't think so . What 'd be the point ? You can hear him whenever you want . I think it's wonderful the way things are changing . Now what you think I am , Miss Daisy ? What do you mean ? The invitation to this dinner came in the mail a month ago . Now , if did be you wanted me to go with you how come you wait ' till we in the car on the way before you asked me ? What ? All I said was Boolie said you wanted to go . Next time you want me to go somewhere ask me regular . You don't have to carry on so much . Let's just leave it alone . Honestly ! Talk about things changing . They ain't changed all that much . I'll help you . Thank you , Hoke , I can help myself . ... can see that the South has marvelous possibilities . Yet in spite of these assets segregation has placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . Yet there are in the white South millions of people of good will whose voices are yet unheard whose course is yet unclear and whose courageous acts are yet unseen . These millions are called upon to gird their courage , to speak out to offer leadership that is needed . History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people . And our generation will have to repent not only for the words and acts of the children of darkness but also for the fears and apathy of the children of light . Morning , Miss Daisy . Miss Daisy ? Hoke , is that Hoke ? It's me . You all right ? Hoke , what did I do with my papers ? My papers ! I had them all corrected last night and I put them where I wouldn't forget them on my way to school . What did you do with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed if I don't give them their homework . I always give it back the next day . That's why they like me . You talking out your head . Why aren't you helping me ? What'll I do ? Find those papers . I told you . It's all right if you moved them . I won't be mad . But I've got to get to school . I'll be late . Who will take care of my class ? They'll be all alone . Oh , God ! I do everything wrong ! Now set down in here . You're going to fall and hurt yourself . I'm so sorry . It's all my fault . I didn't do right . It's so awful ! Ain't nothing awful except the way you carrying on . It's all my fault . I can't find the papers . The children are waiting . There ain't nobody waiting on you . You ain't a teacher . It doesn't make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ! You don't know . This Hoke here . What can I do for you ? It's your mama . What's wrong ? She's taking on something awful . Why's today different from any other day ? No , sir . It's not the same . I'll be right there . Miss Daisy , now there ain't nothing wrong with you ! Your mind done took a turn this morning . You'll snap back if you let yourself . I can't ! I can't ! You're a lucky old woman . No ! It's all a mess now , and I can't do anything about it . Now look at you . You rich , you well for your time . You got folks who care what happens to you . I am being trouble . I don't want to be trouble to anybody . You want something to cry about , I'll run you to the state home let you see what's laying out there . I bet there ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I'm sorry . I'm so sorry . Those poor children . You keep this up and Mr . Werthan's going to call that doctor on you . Just as sure as you born , that doctor is going to have you out in that asylum . Now is that the way you want it to be ? Do you still have that Hudson ? You talking about from when I first come here ? No , Miss Daisy . That thing been in the junkyard now ... more than 15 years . I'm driving your next to last car now . 1965 Cadillac . It's running fine as wine , too . You ought not to be driving anything the way you see . Now , how you know how I can see ' less'n you can look out my eyes . You're my best friend . - Go on now , Miss Daisy . - No , really . You are . You are . Well , Hoke , good to see you ! - You didn't drive yourself here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My granddaughter drove me . My Lord , is she old enough to drive ? Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now . She's teaching biology at yonder Spelman College . I never knew that . Seems mighty funny to sell the house while Mama's still alive . Yes , sir , I imagine it do . But she hasn't been inside the door for two years . I know . I suppose you don't see her very much . No , sir , I don't . It's hard , not driving , Mr . Werthan . There's no bus that goes out yonder . Course , I take a taxicab as often as I can . I ' m sure she appreciates it . Some days she's better than others . But then , who ain't ? Happy Thanksgiving , Mama ! Look who I brought ! Morning , Miss Daisy . You been keeping yourself busy ? She certainly has . She goes to jewelry making ... How many times a week ? She makes all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular Tiffany's . Isn't that something ! Are you all right , Mama ? Hoke , I thought of you the other day . - I saw an Avondale milk truck . - Is that right ? A big monster of a thing . Must've had 16 wheels . Go on away from here . I wondered how you 'd have liked driving that around . Hoke came to see me , not you . This is one of her good days . Mama , Florine said to wish you a happy Thanksgiving . She's in Washington . She's a Republican National Committeewoman now . Good God ! Go charm the nurses ! She wants you all to herself . You are a doodle , Mama . Boolie paying you still ? Every week . How much ? Now that's between him and me . Highway robbery ! It sure is . It sure is . How are you ? I'm doing the best I can . Me , too . Well , that's about all there is to it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie .

Yeah , but I'm not really late . I don't care . Three minutes late , Wilson . Cromwell's . Write it down tomorrow ? Today . Any boy late for the morning prayers is given Cromwell's , which is the word here for punishment . Why ? If you ask me why it's called "" Cromwell's , "" I'll say , "" ' Y ' is a crooked letter and you can't make it straight . "" - Quite . - Don't worry , sir . You'll soon get the hang of it . Mr . Gilbert , new master for next term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trouble with the alarm clock again , sir ? Morning , boys . Morning , sir . Announcements . The interhouse boat race was won by Ironsides . And we have to thank , for the excellent organization , Mr . Hunter . Tomorrow , 2:00 PM , cricket match . Scarffenel boys versus School First-11 . And tomorrow evening at 8:30 PM , concert by Small Choir from the library steps . Now , Prize Giving on Friday will be the earlier time of 9:00 AM . This is to enable Mr . Fletcher to reach London in order to join the NCC squad in preparation for their match against the Australians at Lords . Now , now , now , now , now . There's no need , no ... to get overexcited . There'll be tears before bedtime . Right . Now , as you know , Mr . Fletcher is giving up teaching to become a professional cricketer . Now , I'm sure you want to wish him well for the future at Prize Giving . Now , you'll also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr . Crocker-Harris is resigning because of ill health . He's been with us for 18 years . He's taking up less arduous duties at another school , and I'm sure we're all very , very sorry to lose him . And of course , we'll be sorry to lose his wife , also . She's been with us for 15 of those 18 years , and , uh , she's endeared herself to us all so much . Now , hymn number 555 , "" Lead Us Heavenly Father , Lead Us . "" Who do you think's the best left-arm baller in the country ? - You are ! - You are ! Oh , no , really , come on . Don't be ridiculous , come on . Move . Make way for Mr . Harris . I'll do it on the back . Where would you like it ? Just over there ? All right . Come on , sir , it's the end of term , sir . Oh , yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never promised . I never make promises to juvenile delinquents . You did , sir . You just want to see me blow myself up , don't you , you little monsters ? Frank . No . Excuse me , Frank . Good morning . I still need the details of your classes for next term . Oh , right , uh , sorry , Andrew . Um , could I get them to you today ? I 'd be obliged . Just the final piece of the jigsaw as it were . Would 12:00 at my house be convenient ? All right , listen . One more experiment , but if you let anybody know , I'll have your heads , you understand ? - Yeah ! - All right . - You're like policemen . - Sorry ? You get younger and younger . Laura Crocker-Harris . Tom Gilbert . I'm taking over from your husband . I know , you're going to be head of the new language department . Andrew , my husband , was only head of classical languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . Could you point to me Mr . Frank Hunter ? I'll do better than that . Follow me . Laura . Diana . Are we still going into town ? Uh , darling , I'll be right back . Ah , Laura . I'm going to miss your regular attendance in morning prayers . Well , thank you , Headmaster . I shall miss it , too . It's a nice way to start the day . And the library won't be the same without you . Well , well , well . Tell me , how is Andrew taking all this ? Well , I hope . Yes , thank you , Headmaster . He's , um , bearing up . That's sad . Very sad . Hey , Taplow , did you get your switch to science ? I don't know . I'm just going to ask . You work in the library ? Oh , just two days a week . Now , I have to seat parents . I 'd like you supervise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 Tannoys and ... Good morning , Laura . Hello , Laura . Excuse me for interrupting . This is , uh , Keith Rafferty , head of sciences ... frightfully important ... and Frank Hunter . Tom Gilbert . Andrew's successor . Hello . Hello . Hello , the headmaster asked me to show you to your room . If you don't mind . No , not at all . I hear you did a bit of rowing up at Oxford . Oh , God , another sportsman . The head loves them on the staff . I'm waiting to see who wins Wimbledon . We'll need somebody to take over from Frank in chemistry when he goes back to the colonies . Well , we must keep our bodies in shape , mustn't we ? Sir . Um , I was wondering if I could have a word with you . Certainly not . The bell's gone , it's too late . That's right . Cut along . Sir ? Cut along . Frank , you don't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't ? What ... What do we say ? We say , "" fuck off . "" And remember , don't bully the big boys . Pick on the little one's , it's safer . Good luck . Thank you . I should say hello to Mr . Crocker-Harris . Oh , um ... Listen , you can talk to him later , I mean , we don't want to keep the headmaster waiting . - Okay . - Come on , I'll show you where you're sleeping . Sir . Do I disturb you , sir ? Perhaps . I know the rules , sir , but it's very important to me . Have I ... ? Have I got my switch to upper fifth science , sir ? You have obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and certainly no more . And , Taplow , I shall expect you at the house for extra work at 12:15 , precisely . What is it ? I 'd fixed to play golf , sir . Well , then you must unfix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . You can't expect me to take money from your father under false pretenses . He won't mind , sir . I'm not sure I should take your word for that , Taplow . No , sir . The point is that we mind , don't we ? Yes , sir . We mind . 12:15 , extra work . And you're an exchange , I take it ? Yup . Just finished my first year . I'm here for three . Do you like it ? Yeah , it's a great place to teach . You just feel the history , the tradition . They put me up here when I first came for my interview . I didn't sleep a wink . The beds also date back to 1667 , I think . I'll be fine . It's only for two nights . Are you married ? Yes . Kids ? Yes , two . We'll all be here next term . Have you found a place to stay ? Yes , we're taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our classrooms are in this building . Go on , there , there . Up here , up here is the upper fifth science , where Mr . Hunter manufactures foul-smelling concoctions for his own perverted branch of learning . Well , not as perverted as the classics . Won't , uh , Mr . Gilbert be teaching the boys about rape and murder , incest ? Unworthy , Mr . Hunter . If you knew more about the classics , you scientists , you might be less keen to destroy this little planet of ours . Wasn't it Einstein who said , "" We don't understand science properly "" ? No , I believe he said , "" We don't know how to use it sensibly . "" Have a nice day , Mr . Gilbert . If only he had a little more discipline . Of course , he's an American , you know . Shit , he's coming . Now , boys , Mr . Crocker-Harris is not here yet ? No , sir . Six minutes to go , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson . How's your father ? Um , he's quite well , thank you , sir . But my name's Wilson , sir . Wilson , is it really ? But your father's all right just the same , is he ? Yes , thank you , sir . He's quite dried out now . Well , well . Now , boys , this is Mr . Gilbert . He's going to be the head of our new languages department . I trust those of you who will remain in this class next term will be as well behaved with Mr . Gilbert as I'm sure you were with Mr . Crocker-Harris . Good morning , boys . It might interest you to sit in on this period , Mister ... Mister ... Gilbert . ... Gilbert , yes ... Mr . Gilbert , and observe your future pupils in action . Yes , if I see him , I'll warn him . Thank you , sir . Pay attention to Mr . Gilbert , boys . He doesn't take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still report your misdoings to me today . I put 150 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide solution in this water bottle . Biggles , had a nosebleed this morning and was kind enough to donate this blood . So we'll just mix this with the hydrogen peroxide solution . Biggles , what do we got in this jar here ? Iron sulfate . That's right . Nick , could you tell me the chemical formula for iron sulfate ? FeSO4 , sir . That's very good . Now , hang on . Well ... now this has never happened before . Um , boys , I think you ought to just back off now . What do you got in your blood , Biggs ? Okay , boys , what do you want to do next ? You there . What do you want ? Piss off , Taplow . All right , knock it off . You tried to see me this morning . Yes , sir . Well , why are you following me around ? You with the CIA ? KGB ? MI-5 ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . What's your name , boy ? Taplow , sir . I'll be in your class next term if I get my switch . This isn't next term . This is this term . Vamoose . Get out of here . Taplow . What's the , uh , the chemical formula for ethanol ? C2H50H , sir . Rouse ! Get out of here ! Oy , Taplow . You'll know . What's up with the Crock ? Why's he being forced to retire ? There's nothing wrong with him . The head just wanted to give him the chop , that's all . I know exactly what it is . One night ... first time for about ten years ... he had it away with his wife , and it gave him a heart attack . That's you , I should think . No , it's not his heart . If there's anything wrong with him , it's probably piles . Of course , it's piles . It always gets ' em in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles . It's his heart . It can't be his heart . He hasn't got one . Right . Hitler's a sadist . Cut it out , boys . I'm not really interested . It is his heart , sir . I have extra lessons with him . Thank you . Sadists don't have hearts anyway . Are you going to be running special projects ? Yes , I believe so . Well , the fact is , we both want to start a magazine , and you allocate the funds , sir . Mr . Crocker-Harris is still in charge , isn't he ? So he should settle this . Well , sir , you see , Mr . Crocker-Harris always says no to anything new . I don't think he does hate people . I don't think he likes people , either . And he doesn't care whether people like him . Then I 'd say he hasn't a care in the world . "" You've obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us a chance ... "" ... no less , and certainly ... "" I think we 'd quite like him . And now , I won't tell you again . The fact is ... I feel sorry for him . Sorry for old Hitler ? You little ass crawler , Taplow ! Stop ... Stop it now ! That's enough ! Good morning , sir . I'm Gilbert . Good morning . Wilson . Sir ? Apparently you were late for chapel . Just a few seconds . I-I was in the library , and you can't hear the bell . No doubt you will recount those excuses to your housemaster . I fear I'm not interested in them . Sir . These are your Latin verses . Only one boy's efforts , Bullers ' , had any merit and that somewhat doubtful . The rest were mainly abominable . It seems to me that the best way of employing the first part of this period would be for all of you to attempt the verse again . And if you should find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may console yourselves , as good classicists , with the thought that , to amend an aphorism ... Taplow ? Yes , sir . You laughed at my little epigram . Yes , sir . I'm flattered at the obvious advance your Latin has made that you should so readily understand what the rest of the class did not . Perhaps you would be good enough to explain it to them so that they can share your pleasure . Come along , Taplow . Don't be so selfish as to keep a good joke to yourself . Tell the others . I didn't hear it properly , sir . You didn't hear it ? Indeed . Then why , may I ask , did you laugh ? Why did you laugh at what you did not hear ? Politeness , sir . I beg your pardon . Politeness , sir . Toujours la politesse . I'm touched , Taplow . But if you really wish to show me politeness , you will do so now by translating verses less appalling than the one's I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for him ? Finish now . As this is the , uh ... last time we shall meet as a class , it may not be amiss for me to say good-bye and wish you all the best of good fortune . And now the end of term treat . We will read a scene from the Agamemnon by Aeschylus . Agamemnon is perhaps the greatest play ever written . The scene I have selected starts with Clytaemnestra standing over the bodies of Agamemnon her husband and the prophetess Cassandra , both of whom she's just murdered . Very well , Laughton , begin . Uh , forgive me for interrupting , but I have the impression you understand nothing of what you're reading . No , sir . I ... Clytaemnestra has just committed murder . She is describing her foul deed . She's unrepentant . Hmm ? Do you not think she would show some emotion ? Well , of course , sir . I was just ... I realize , Laughton , that you may not have met a wife who has destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , alas , that such wives do exist . He used his imagination , Laughton . Imagination ... a word I think not in your vocabulary . For example ... "" I stand upon mine act . Yea , where I struck . "" Do you not think , uh , in saying those words she might reveal a flash of , uh , cruelty and of pride ? Hmm ? Defiant creature . And then here ... "" And I confess it , "" I did use such craft he could not fly nor fend him against death . "" "" I caught him in a net as men catch fish . "" No room , no rathole in his loopless robe . "" I struck him twice . "" And once and twice he groaned , he doubled up his limb . "" And with that stroke , committed him to Zeus that keeps the dead . "" Very well , you may leave . Good-bye , sir . Cheerio , sir . Good-bye , sir . Good-bye , Mr . Crocker-Harris . Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fa-la-la-la-la-la In the winsome month of May ... Oy ! Walk ! We've got to get him . I don't know . We'll get in trouble . Come on , Taplow . Trubshaw's always picking on you . We could do it tomorrow . Come on . It'll be a laugh . It's the last day of term . What can they do ? Thank you , sir . I realize , of course , you will not be putting so much emphasis on the study of Greek and Latin . Perhaps they may be even dropped from the curriculum , or made optional extras . My remit from the headmaster is to organize a new language department , sir . That really means modern languages . I believe we need a greater concentration on German , French , Spanish . It is , after all , a multicultural society . Ah , yes , yes ... the modern approach . Not so many years ago , the great passion was to learn Russian . Then came perestroika . Russian wasn't trendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to observe . Not at all . Perhaps we shall see each other later . Hello . Anybody home ? Just me , sir . Taplow . You are following me around . No . Sir . I've got extra work with Mr . Crocker-Harris . Uh-huh . But he's not here yet . And Mrs . Crocker-Harris ? Uh ... no , she's not here either . What are you studying ? Aeschylus , sir . The Agamemnon . Have you ever read it ? Well , no . I can't say that I have . Is it any good ? Oh , um ... well , as a matter of fact , it is , really . Yeah , well , what's it about ? Lt ... it's about a wife who's unfaithful , and murders her husband . I get it . A comedy . Say ... say , listen , did you get a chance to talk to Mr . Crocker-Harris about your transfer to my science class ? Yes . And ? What did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . What is it ? You have obtained exactly what you deserve ... no less , and certainly no more . Andrew ? Andrew , is that you ? Oh . What a pleasant surprise . Hi ya , Laura . Didn't expect to see you here . Hello , Taplow . Oh , Andrew asked me to come by . It's about my timetable for next term . Oh , and he's not here . Well , it's not like Andrew to be late , now , is it , Taplow ? No , Mrs . Crocker-Harris . Well , excuse me , gentlemen . I think I'll just go put these things upstairs . Do you think she heard ? Heard what ? Me impersonating ... Frank . Oh , I , uh ... I've got your timetable here , Andrew . Oh , excellent . Just what I wanted . Sorry I'm late , Taplow . I'll just put these down . Frank , we see you too rarely . Hello , Laura . Andrew , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you're going to be joining us at the concert tomorrow evening . Oh , yes . I'm looking forward to it . Taplow , why don't you go and get the lemonade ? You know where everything is . Thank you , Mrs . Crocker-Harris . How have you been ? Frank , would you like to see the timetable for next term ? Yes , I 'd like that very much , Andrew . Take that outside , Taplow . We'll have our glass in the garden today . Let's see . There you are . You've really done a beautiful job , Andrew . Well , thank you . It has the merit of clarity , I think . I don't know what we're going to do without you . You'll find somebody else , I expect . Or , uh ... perhaps they'll buy a computer . Say , what exactly is this new job of yours , Andrew ? Teaching English to foreigners . Andrew's doctor believes it will be less of a strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Andrew . There's nothing to be sorry about . I'm looking forward to the change . See you later . So long , Andrew . Begin , Taplow . "" Oh , Clytemnestra , we are surprised that ... "" "" We marvel at . "" "" We marvel at thy tongue ... Mm . "" ... how bold thou art , that thou can ... "" Canst "" is more poetic . Canst . "" ... canst utter such a boastful speech ... "" Mm . "" ... over the , the bloody corpse of the husband , you've just so foully murdered . "" Taplow , I presume you're using a different text to mine . No , sir . That's strange , I see no "" foully murdered , "" no "" bloody corpse . "" Simply ... "" husband . "" Yes , sir . Why do you insist on inventing words that are simply not there ? Go on , Taplow . Go on , I wish to understand . I was thinking a bit like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates her husband Agamemnon . He returns from winning the war , and what does she do ? She welcomes him back and then murders him . She stabs him over and over and then makes a speech ... I'm , I'm delighted in your interest in the more lurid aspects of dramaturgy , Taplow . But I still fail to understand why you should wish to improve Aeschylus . Today in class , sir ... for the first time I got a sense of the horror . L-It was so vivid . I mean , why can't we put more life into the translation , sir , like you did ? Why can't we use words like , like , "" bloody "" and "" corpse "" and "" murder ? "" Hmm . When I was a very young man , not much older than you are now , I wrote for my own pleasure a translation of the Agamemnon , a very free translation , I remember , in rhyming couplets . That must have been hard work . Yes , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived great pleasure from it , because the play had excited and moved me as it did you , and I wanted to communicate , however imperfectly , some of that emotion . A little like what happened in class today . My translation , I remember thinking was very beautiful ... almost more beautiful than the original . Was it ever published ? I'm sorry ? Was it ever published ? Oh , no , no . No , it was never published . Shall I go on , sir ? Uh , no , I fear we've run out of time . Um ... may I go now , sir ? Yes . And , Taplow ... "" The art of learning is to conceal learning . "" And I wouldn't try it on any of your friends . It isn't particularly funny . I wouldn't know , sir . Turn that , turn that ghastly noise down ! Off ! Now , Buller ... Where's Buller ? Your mother's just telephoned . She's awfully sorry , but neither she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here today . She wants you to take the train tomorrow . Shrewsbury . Then the chauffeur will meet you at the station . You all right , Buller ? Sir . Good . Keep the noise down . I know it's hard , Buller . But you'll get used to it , believe me . Fuck off . Good morning . Morning . Sleep well ? Yes , fine , thanks . And you ? Yes , fine , thank you . There you are . Oh , there's a ... a letter for you . Is everything all right ? Your mother all right ? Yes . Fine , fine . Um ... I forgot to cancel the papers . Do you need anything from the village ? No , no , thank you . Laura . Were you expecting someone else ? I thought we agreed that we wouldn't meet here . Who were you expecting ? Gilbert , the new guy . Laura ... come away from the window please . Would you please come away from the window ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty . It's the Puritan in you . I love fucking you . You talk when you make love . Kettle , it's , it's just boiling . Which is more , apparently , than we can say for you . Laura , I haven't got much time . No , I don't think I have either . Tea ? Frank , you're more English than the English . Listen , if Gilbert does come , let's just say you're here delivering a message from Andrew . To hell with Gilbert . I've got good news . Oh ? What ? Don't worry , I'm not pregnant . I've had a letter from my mother . She's decided to visit my sister in Canada . So , I can have her cottage in Dorset for the whole summer . That's great . Andrew starts his new job in September , but I don't have to go there immediately . That means you and I can be alone together . If you like . Just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won't you ? Frank ? Frank ... I need you . I need to be with you . You know my , my father's not well . I may have to go back to the States . God , you remind me of him . Of who ? Of whom . Of whom , of Andrew , of course . He didn't always used to be the old Croc , you know . He wasn't much older than you are now when I first met him . He was so pure , so ... so idealistic . But just as ungiving . What happened to him ? I did . Weren't you two ever happy together ? I can't remember . Can't remember . Laura , I ... I feel sorry for him . No you don't . You feel guilty because you're screwing his wife . Or to be more accurate , because his wife is screwing you . I think we should tell him . Tell him what ? About us . What , are you insane ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell would you want to tell him for , Laura ? What are we talking about now ... Marriage ? Divorce ? I'm talking about us . I don't want us to become just good friends . Listen , Laura ... Don't . Deja vu . I know exactly what you're going to say now . You're going to say you're not ready to settle down . Isn't that what you were going to say ? Anyone home ? Oh , yes , come in , Headmaster . Ah , Andrew , Andrew , can't stay long . Lovely day . Beautiful , yes . Uh , would you like to sit down ? Two things I wanted to discuss with you . Can I offer you tea or anything ? Oh , no , don't bother about tea . You have enough to do . Two most stressful things in life ... moving and divorce . You know , it's extremely unlucky ... ill health should have forced your retirement . Well , I felt that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was yourself and the governors who thought that my health ... Well , quite so , quite so . I was going on to say that it's unlucky about your having to retire before becoming entitled to a pension . You have decided not to award me a pension . Not I . Not I . Lord Baxter and the governors thought long and hard about it . They were felt unable to , um ... make an exception . But , uh ... exceptions have been made in the past , have they not ? Ah . Richardson , you mean . Well , those were exceptional circumstances . After all , it was in playing football , staff against school , he received his injury . I understand . The second thing I wanted ... Oh , Headmaster . I was just leaving . Oh , uh ... well , can I offer you a coffee or ... it's too early for sherry , isn't it ? Oh , it's far too early . No , I'll leave you to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ve completed the timetable . It's hot . Would you like to take it with you ? Oh , thank you very much . Thank you very much , Andrew . Oh , what do you make of your successor , young Tom Gilbert ? He seems very agreeable . Very agreeable . High academic honors at Oxford . Chancellor's Prize for Latin verse . Oh , Andrew got that , too . And a double First . Of course you did . Sometimes it's hard to remember , you know , but you must be one of the most brilliant scholars ever to come to this school . You're very kind . Oh , when I say it's hard to remember , it's because you've done so many other good things . You know , timetable , your heroic battle for so long with the soul- destroying lower fifth . Well , I haven't found that my soul has been destroyed by the lower fifth , Headmaster . Oh . Uh ... No , I was only joking . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other matter you wished to discuss ? Oh , nothing , nothing at all , Andrew . And , uh , I was just saying , Laura , the two most stressing things in life ... moving house and divorce . Well , bad luck , Andrew and , um , I'll see you later . Bye-bye . Good-bye , sir . Well , do we get it ? Do we get what ? The pension . Do we get the pension ? No . What ? No . Why not ? It's against the rules . Well , Richardson got one . Why couldn't they give one to you ? It was special circumstances . He received his injuries playing soccer for the staff against the school . And what did you say ? Just stood there and made some joke in Latin , I suppose . There was very little I could say in Latin or any other language . Oh , I would have said something . Don't you worry , I would have ... I'm sure you would . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew ? You're a wimp . You always were and you always will be ... a double first-class wimp . You know , I think I could have forgiven you anything if you 'd have just once said , "" No . Enough , "" not just to me but to every setback you've ever had . There was an old lady of 82 ... Parlez-vous ? Oh ! Out . Go on , out . Out ! Out ! - Out ! - Out ! Not you , Taplow . Stay there . Out ! Move it ! Come on . You go to the Crock's house for extra work , don't you ? Yeah . Yes , Trubshaw . Yes ... Trubshaw . Very good . So what's the gossip , then ? I don't know , Trubshaw . Well , word is , Mrs . Crocker-Harris is having it off with somebody . Is that right ? I , I really don't know , Trubshaw . Oh , come on , Taplow ... I've seen you . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s she shagging ? Who is it ? Dr . Rafferty . I've no idea , honestly . Would you like to give her one ? Have you ever seen her tits ? I have . She was in the library once . She bent over . No bra , nothing . Gorgeous . I bet you 'd like to put your face between them , wouldn't you , Taplow , you little wanker ? Your parents coming down today ? No . No ? Oh . Why not ? Oh . Your mother's having it off with somebody as well . Word is , she's a good fuck , your mother . Is that right ? Huh ? Ah , Missus ... Missus , uh ... - Missus ... - Wilson . Wilson . How are you ? - I have a complaint . - Oh , dear . Ten spaghetti and one lettuce leaf is not enough for a growing boy . Ludwig tells me that's all he's had for dinner for the past week . - Ah , well ... - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s properly fed . I'll speak to the kitchens about it . Do excuse me , won't you ? I don't believe in stuffing the boys , you know , dear . Ah , King Abakendi . Do you know he owns most of Nigeria ? Really ? Oh , Your Majesty , how lovely to see you . Dr . Frobisher . Ah . You know my wife Jane . Madam . Of course . And Lord Baxter , head of Eurospace Industries , chairman of our governors . Yes , and , uh , Lady Baxter . Delighted , delighted . A chap from Nigeria working for me ... head of the design department . I'm sure you know him . Oh . What is his name ? We are very fortunate once again ... Oh , he's doing very well . You know , he's doing very well , this boy . Marvelous job he's doing , yes . Now , Your Majesty , you know , Lord Baxter and I would like to discuss our proposed center for Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opening the batting ... is their captain , David Fletcher . This will probably be the last time that we'll ever see David playing amateur cricket , as he goes to London tomorrow to join the NCC . I'm ... sorry , sir . Oh . No , no . It is I who should apologize . After all , this is your room now , not mine . If you'll allow me to continue with the chore of packing . I only came in here because this room is to become the center of the new language block , and , well , I didn't expect anyone to be here . I shan't be very long , I promise you . Please don't hurry , sir . The fact is , this afternoon , uh , I was feeling rather nervous . You know , attack of the jitters , and , uh , I thought that if I came in here and rehearsed taking a class or something , it ... it might calm me . Um , I expect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that ? You keep such order . I saw that yesterday morning , and , well , after all , they call you the "" Hitler of the Lower Fifth . "" That was clumsy of me , sir . I'm sure nothing's meant by it . It-it's just that you ... you keep such wonderful discipline , that's all . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . They're , uh , not bad boys . Sometimes a little wild and unfeeling , perhaps , but not bad . In the beginning , I tried very hard to communicate some of my own joy in the great literature of the past . I failed ... as , of course , you will fail 999 times out of a thousand . But a single success can atone for all the failures in the world and sometimes ... very rarely , it's true ... sometimes , I had that success . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . I'm desperately sorry . Don't apologize . I , uh , should have known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively disliked . I realized many long years ago that the ... the boys no longer laughed at me , but I ... I don't know why they no longer found me funny . Perhaps when you became ill . No . No , I don't think so . I really don't know . In the earlier years , they used to laugh at me . At me , not with me . At my ... uh ... funny mannerisms and tricks of speech , which we all develop . The Hitler of the Lower Fifth . I would have thought that by now that epithet would have lost its significance . Apparently not . Undoubtedly ... it will become my epitaph . I'm sure they'll come up with something much worse for me . Well ... I bequeath you this room . I wish you a great success in it . I'll do my best , sir . And good luck to you in your future career . My future career ? Yes . Thank you . The , uh ... The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't they ? And there's another four runs to Fletcher . Ah , Laura , Andrew . Headmaster , Lord Baxter . Good afternoon . Uh , Lord Baxter and I would like to ask you , uh ... have a little chat with you , Andrew . Uh , good time for a word ? Well , the great thing about cricket is you can talk and watch at the same time . Precisely well put , Laura . A little favor I have to ask you , Andrew . And what favor would that be , Headmaster ? It concerns tomorrow's Prize Giving . I take it you're prepared to say a few words ? Yeah . Well , I have , uh , I have made a few notes . Oh , well hit . Well hit , Fletcher . Good , good , good . I know I can trust your discretion , not to mention your wit . And I'm sure you'll agree with me that we don't want these things to become too long and distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puns and jokes in my speech . That would be extremely acceptable . Oh . Fine stroke , Fletcher . Oh , yes . Yes , that's good , just the thing . I-I also want to touch on a matter of some gravity . No doubt , no doubt . Now , the favor I want to ask you is this . You see , Fletcher ... Fletcher is much , much junior to you , of course , and , uh , as such , his speech would come first , and yours last . Absolutely . But , uh , you know how the boys feel about David . They adore him . They simply adore him . Now , there could well be a terrific display of emotion tomorrow , which would be difficult for me to cut short . Fletcher's simply racing to his talent . So , uh , do you wish me to speak first ? Well , I feel wretched about asking you this , Andrew . I really do . But , you know , a thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sure you 'd agree with me there . You understand , don't you , Laura ? Well , naturally , Headmaster , I would not wish to provide an anticlimax . I'll speak first . Don't take it amiss , Andrew . Nothing personal . Boys will be boys . I mean , they 'd much rather applaud the-the sportsman than the scholar . It's only natural . But it's quite impersonal , I promise you . Well played , Tom ! Well played ! The possibility of a century here for David Fletcher . Laura ? Ah . Yes , Diana . Isn't Fletcher batting superbly ? Oh , uh , just fantastic , but I got to tell you , every time he hits the ball , I think he's going to drop the bat and run to first base . - Oh , really . - Good heavens . He's 95 . This could be his 100th . Oh . Yes , that's 100 on Fletcher . Tea , I think , everybody . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon . Mmm . Tea and cakes ? You coming to tea ? I 'd rather watch a little more cricket if you don't mind . Uh , Frank ? Could you escort Laura to tea , please ? Sure . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the school supports many charities , and some of the charities that we do support will have stands in and around the chapel today so that you can see the sort of work that the school is doing with the money ... Sir ? Sir ? Uh , I'm sorry to disturb you , sir , but-but I did want to see . Disturb me , indeed . Well ? Um ... Well , Taplow ? I ... I thought this might interest you , sir . First translation of the Agamemnon , sir . Good heavens . The Browning version . I've glanced at it . I don't think it's much good , but ... I agree , the translation has its faults , but I think you'll enjoy it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browning employs . Very interesting , Taplow . It ... it's for you , sir . For me ? Yes , sir . I-I've written in it . Did you ... buy this ? Yes , sir . It's only secondhand . You shouldn't spend your pocket money in that way . That's all right . It wasn't very much . The price isn't still inside , is it ? No . Only what you wrote . Nothing else . What's the matter , sir ? Have I put the accents wrong ? No . The perispwmenon is perfectly correct . Oh ... Forgive me ... Taplow , I've ... I've been under rather a strain . Yes , sir . I understand . Well good-bye , sir . And the best of luck . That's tea ! Ladies and gentleman , the umpire has called tea , which will be taken in the large dining marquee near the entrance to the chapel . Mr . Crocker-Harris . Uh , excuse me , sir . Do you remember us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't tell me . Wait a moment . Trimmer , and you're Newton . Yes , sir . We just saw you there , sir , thought we 'd say hello , sir . And what have you two been up to ? I'm in banking , sir . Actually , I'm the managing director of National Western . Are you , indeed ? And I'm in the Army , sir . Communications . Communications , eh ? But not in classical Greek , I fancy . Well , actually , sir , Newton's the youngest brigadier in the British Army . Indeed ? Congratulations . Stand easy , Brigadier . Oh . Well , it's very nice to see you both . Yes , sir . I see Fletcher got his hundred , sir . Oh , well , it's only to be expected . He's a superb player . And-And quite , uh , quite beautiful to watch , isn't he ? Yes . Well , continued success to you . - And to you , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God help me , I'm still terrified of the old bugger . Me , too . Wonderful inning . Special , Dave . - Thank you , sir . - Splendid . Excuse me . So , there I was in my hotel corridor , absolutely naked , and no key . I wish I 'd been there . Andrew , have a seat . Oh , thank you . - Thank you . - Hello , Andrew . You're looking pleased with yourself . What have you been up to ? That's a lot to ask , Laura . Well , I'm looking pleased with reason . I think I've just been given a present . Oh , by whom ? - Taplow . - Taplow ? That's fantastic . Hey . So , what was the present ? Well , it's , uh , a translation of The Agamemnon , by , uh , by Robert Browning . - Great . - Let me see . Oh , he's inscribed it . What does it mean ? Darling ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh , it's all Greek to me . Mr . Gilbert , can you enlighten us , please ? Uh , how marvelous . It's a hexameter . Yes , but what does it mean ? Well , I'm not familiar with th-the Browning version , but , uh , roughly , uh , it translates as : "" God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master . "" Oh , how sweet ! And very apt . Can't imagine a boy giving me a present . Nor me . A very wonderful thing to do , don't you think ? - Yes . - Yes , very much , so , yeah . And he , he bought it with his own pocket money . What was the inscription again ? "" God from afar looks graciously upon a kind master . "" Well , perhaps not "" kind master , "" but ... "" gentle master . "" Yes , I agree , uh , with Mr . Gilbert . I think "" gentle "" is a better translation . Uh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would rather have this present than anything else I could think of . Cunning little brat . Why cunning , Laura ? Andrew , you don't have any wine . Can I give you some champagne ? Why cunning , Laura ? Because yesterday , I saw Taplow doing an impersonation of you for Frank . Well , obviously he was afraid that I would tell you , and that you would put him on Cromwell's , or stop his switch to Frank's form , or some other Hitlerian torture . The book is clearly an insurance policy ... a sweetener . A bribe . I see . Laura , go and tell him it was a lie . Certainly not . It wasn't a lie . Then I'll tell him . I wouldn't do that if I were you . He'll only hate you for your sympathy . Andrew doesn't need sympathy . That's his strength . Andrew ? I want to make something clear about Taplow . He has a genuine affection for you . Andrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure that book . I 'd rather like to be left alone at the moment , thank you . You may find that it'll ... have a special meaning to you . Oh , yes , it will mean something . It will remind me of my own foolishness . You don't deserve this . I mean ... You've been treated badly , sir . By the school , you mean ? Not just by the school . Never , never presume to know the secrets of a marriage . Take my advice ... sir . Make a new start for yourself . You could still find someone who will care for you , who'll ... who'll be loyal , and who won't ... who'll ... be faithful . Ah . Hmm . We ... We were incompatible from the moment we met . Although ... neither of us realized that at the time . Of course , Laura was , uh ... was only 22 years of age . We both required love , but of different kinds . Worlds apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic ... or abnormal . Just the problem of a dissatisfied wife and an inadequate husband . Often , I believe , a subject for Faust . Is there anything I can do to help you ? I 'd like to help ... you . Yes . Don't take sides . It's so very unbecoming . Hey ! Did you see that , Andrew ? 112 nut out , Fletcher , and seven for 23 . Send out the schools . Skittle them out . Let me do that . You left Taplow's present behind . I put it in your study . Thank you . It wasn't a very good impersonation . I'm ... I'm sorry . Laura . We , uh ... we inhabit different worlds , you and I . We always have . We always will . What are you saying ? I'm saying "" No . "" I'm saying , "" Enough . "" Better not keep the headmaster waiting . Do you still expect me to come to your Prize Giving ? I , uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer to expect anything of the other . Right . Well , I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning then . As you wish . And does your new school provide spending accommodation for staff ? We haven't found anything that we like yet . I've read somewhere the two worst things in life are moving house and divorce . So , Laura , if I were you , I ... Oh , hello , darling . Well , I finished my rounds . Do you know , I often think being a headmaster's like being a head waiter , except head waiters have to learn how to speak at least five languages . This isn't the best moment , sir , but we're not staying the night , so , um ... if ever you need any financial advice , uh , assistance in deed ... anything of that sort , please telephone . I 'd like to help . Think of it as , um ... well , as repayment . Well , thank you very much . This is extremely civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . - I'll see you . - Good night . Shut it . You'll get me in trouble . What's going on ? It's all right . - You all right , man ? - Yeah , yeah . You little fucking bastards . Yes ! Hello ? Anybody there ? Oh , Foster . Sorry to disturb you , sir . I've come to pick up Mrs . Crocker-Harris . Oh , yes , yes . She's upstairs . Laura , Mr . Foster's here . I'm coming ! Glorious day . Indeed , sir . Glorious . Sorry to hear about your ... mother-in-law , sir . Ah , yes , yes . Must be a disappointment , sir . Your wife ... not being there for your farewell speech . And ... if I may be so bold , sir ... Well , what is it , Foster ? Well , I 'd just like to say the old place won't be the same without you , sir . Well , thank you , Foster . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster . Would you mind , uh ... there's a couple of suitcases upstairs . Thank you . I think there's , uh , just two more . Well , I mustn't , uh , be late for the Prize Giving . No , eh ... You look very impressive . Yes ? Good-bye . Ah , Andrew , there you are . Right , follow me , everyone . Headmaster , I must tell you I've changed my mind . I , uh , wish to speak second , as is my right . What about Mr . Fletcher ? Mr . Fletcher will have to speak first . But you promised yesterday . Yes , but I now see the matter in an entirely different light , and , uh , today's today . Uh , we're ready for you now ... Just a second , please , Trubshaw . Look , if you speak second ... It'll be the most dreadful anticlimax . Be that as it may , as senior master it is my privilege to so do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . The demill Prize for French studies : S.R . Ryan . The Torkson Prize for Excellence : S . Trubshaw . The Hanson Cup for Biology : E.R . Morris . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my painful duty to listen with you to a few sad words from two masters who are leaving us . First , I shall call upon ... First , let us call upon Mr . David Fletcher . I thought you were going to speak first . Well , chaps ... I'm not much good , you know ... you know , on my feet , except when I'm running between the wickets . So I'll just say I'm really ... sad , you know , to be leaving this wonderful old place . I've loved it here . So , you know ... good luck and ... good-bye . Now , three cheers for David Fletcher ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! Hip , hip ... Hooray ! And now ... Mr . Andrew Crocker-Harris . Study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our culture . And culture is simply an expression of what is best in society . Philosophy , decent government , justice , art , language . Our classical heritage is no longer valued . And how can we help meld civilized human beings ... if we no ... if we no longer believe in civilization ? I am sorry . I'm sorry because I have deserved the epithet "" Hitler of the Lower Fifth . "" I am sorry because I have failed to give you what it is your right to demand of me as your teacher . Sympathy , encouragement , humanity . I have degraded the noblest calling a man can follow ... the care and molding of the young . When I came to this school ... I still b-believed tha-that ... uh , that I ... I had a-a vocation for teaching . I knew what I wanted to do , and yet , I ... I did not do it . I can offer no excuses . I have failed , and miserably failed . And I can only hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countless others who've gone before you ... to ... forgive me for having let you down . I shan't find it ... easy to forgive myself . That is all . Go on . Sir ? Taplow , boys . Good-bye , sir . Good-bye , Taplow . Gentlemen . Bye , sir . Taplow ? Mm . Well , it means if you have any regard for me , next term you will kindly refrain from blowing yourself up when you switch to science . Thank you , sir . Yes ! Well done , Taplow . Thanks a lot . Well done . Well ... You'll miss your train . I'll ... I'll write .

I didn't know the trains still ran from Cleveland . Well , you have to change in Chicago . Here you go , old boy . Would you like a cigar ? - I 'd love to but no , thank you . - Okay . - Cheers , Harry . - Cheers . - Good luck this afternoon . - Thanks , baby ; good to see you . I can't fly anymore .

Why don't you just give me an open end order ... and I'll fill it personally and then you won't have to come to the show ? I told you I just got off a train . I don't know , I can't think about business . I got ta relax . All right . Say , Harry ... is that girl still around ? What girl ? That ... What's her name ? Margo .

Harry , I don't make calls like that from Cleveland . Harry , I don't want to argue with you . You and me , we go back a hell of a long ways . I spent 5,362 nights ... with a sick woman .

We haven't done anything so far ... and they can't lock you up for just thinking about something . Not yet , anyway . How's Linda ? Has she gotten over her fishing phobia yet ? - No , but she enjoys the boat . - Not doing any fishing , though . Nope . I'm still the only fisherman . I guess it's nice out there on a Sunday . Peaceful , quiet . Yeah . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you've forgotten what the ocean smells like . I remember when I was a kid , I hitched a ride on a trolley car to Coney Island . Saw the ocean for the first time . God , nothing could make me forget it . Just blue and green . You ought to come out on the boat , Harry . Yeah , I guess I should . Keep it . You're a very generous citizen . Take a good look at us , we're a vanishing breed . Do you see this , Mac ? You know what it is ? It's a portable bathroom . I can't take five minutes off for a piss . - So don't make jokes with me , mister ! - All right , I'm sorry . - I didn't mean anything . Here , take this . - Stick it up your ass ! It's the pollution , Harry . It makes everybody crazy . - Do you have any drops with you ? - No . My eyes are burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Los Angeles . - What's that ? - It's not Buffalo . You son of a bitch . You know how many times that I've fallen for that ? Did you see in the paper this morning where we lost 3,000 helicopters ? You know how much money that is ? Hell , I don't want to hear about that , drop it . What's the matter ? I mean , the waste , the money . - The men . - Men ? Yeah , the men . What do you want me to say about that ? Hell , I just don't want to talk about it . Screw the helicopters . For God's sake , Harry , what are you getting upset ... - Phil , please ! - I just meant the waste ... - Phil ! - The money . Remember when I went to Milan last year ? - Cotton mills ? - Yeah , that's right . Covered the cotton mills . Then I flew to Rome and I drove down to Anzio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all piled up like a dune ... you know ; it runs about 200 feet . In 1944 that sand was muddy with blood . And last year it was covered with bikinis . Bikinis , you know , cute little buckets ... sweating into the same sand that held all that blood . Hell , I don't want to talk about war . It's the final joke . It shouldn't surprise you . Battlefields have a way of turning into resorts . Wait a minute . Yeah ! Air Mail Special . Only that's not Charlie Christian , he was the original . Oh , Jesus , that was Big Band showtime . One time ... I'm just a kid , see ? And I'm playing drums , we're in this divey joint ... it's up in the mountains . We had a vocalist . Everybody in the band is banging her except me ... and I got a crush on her . God . These Foolish Things . She could sing These Foolish Things , put you right in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her was just ... Before a number she 'd come over ... she 'd lean down and she 'd whisper to me , "" Easy on the brushes , kid ... "" easy on the brushes . "" She was gon na be vocalist with Tommy Dorsey . I was gon na play the drums with Benny Goodman . The difference is , when we were kids all the choices were simple . - Life was simple . Everything added up . - No more . This morning I gave a ride , this kid was hitching . She just goes up and down the Strip . She wanted to ball me , she said . No words , just ... She was hardly older than my daughter ... makes you wonder what the hell's going on out there . Who knows ? Rats are crawling around babies ... they're taking pictures of Mars ... and we're in the balcony talking to Charlie Robbins . Stoner . How are you ? Good to see you again . - Who was that ? - That's Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom . - Hell , Rico's taking care of it . It's his great and glorious moment . Leave him alone . - What'll it be , gents ? - Two White Label on the rocks . You've got ta solve this thing between Rico and Meyer . What ? When are you gon na learn Spanish ? When you learn to fish . I wonder how Freddy's doing . Freddy doesn't have to do anything . Margo's doing all the work . Margo the Machine . The working man's friend . Ernie Koy . Indian Ernie , center-field for the ' 39 Dodgers . I damn near had it fleshed out . Now wait a minute . We had Camilli , Pete Coscarart , Durocher's at short .

Stoner , you got a call for me ? Right field . Damn . Hello . Listen , don't you call anybody , you stay right there , we'll be right up ! - He's alive . - What ? - Making sounds . - Fred ? - I got him breathing . - Oh , my God ! What the hell did you ... You call the desk , get Johnny , and tell him to get the house doctor . A friend of mine , a buyer , collapsed . Get an ambulance . Fred , can you hear me ? It's me , Harry . Fred . He kept pleading with us to prolong it . Prolong it ? Why , for Christ's sake , you're a pro ! You're supposed to know the limits . You know how far to go ! For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out of here ! Shut up and get out , both of you , right now ! Room 9227 . It looks like it might be a heart attack . We need the doctor right away , hurry . I said get out of here ! - I'm sorry , Harry . - Yes , so am I . Ambulance and doctor on the way . Damn it ! We should have gotten the order up front . Order ? Thank God he's alive ! We're responsible , we set this thing up . We're to blame here . The man may die . So he dies ! Then he won't get horny any more . - You're talking about a man , Harry . - He's not a man , he's a casualty . Stay with him and tell the doctor to give him the best and send us the bill . I got to get down to the show . - Jackie , where the hell is he ? - I haven't the slightest idea . - They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm gon na cue the musicians . We're going to start without him . Alfie , did you get the rest of the 238's ? Everything's been here , for the last half hour . Your timing is exquisite . We were just going on . Are you all right , Mr . Stoner ? - I'm fine . - You're sure ? Yes , I'm fine . Welcome to Los Angeles . Before we begin our show , this afternoon ... I should like to present our president , the president of Capri Casuals ... the man who made all this possible , Mr . Harry Stoner . Thank you . Thank you , Jackie . First I would like to ... welcome all of you , thank you for being present ... of course , I don't know all of you personally , but our field men do . And through our ... field men ... our professional ties with some of you ... go back 15 years . There are some faces missing . But the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ... what we're going to present , this afternoon . Our field men , of course , will ... remain after the show , to take your orders ... and answer the questions , on delivery dates ... and trajectory and costs . That's ... Capri has a very special significance for me ... because I was recuperating there , you see ? It was a sanctuary for the living ... it was beautiful , Roman columns and it was quiet ... and it was filled with men , brave men that stuck together ... because they believed in something . It had a very special significance ... - What Mr . Stoner means ... - Capri ... Is that Capri was not an accident , but rather an inspiration . Now , how about a nice round of applause for Mr . Stoner ? Ladies and gentlemen ... we begin our show and our theme , this afternoon is , Isle of Capri . We designed this line for the chic woman ... Now as usual , you've all been given your description list ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . So let's start the show this afternoon , with Number 235 ... White , uncrushable linen pantsuit , marvelous red wallpaper printed shirt ... tied together , with its own matching belt . Available in two other color combinations . - Are you all right ? - Fine , yeah . Something wrong ? What the hell is wrong ? Nothing is wrong .

I just wanted to tell you Harry , I'm sorry . Everybody misses . Not professionals . Yeah , professionals , too . Quarterbacks get knocked down ... nurses get knocked up , somebody invented the Edsel . Everybody misses . Everybody misses . - Would you care for something to drink ? - No . Just the check . Okay . Must've scared the hell out of you . Look , some night let's have dinner . What are we going to talk about ? Business . - Yours or mine ? - We both sell the same thing . - What's that ? - Imagination . Yeah , that's what they buy . Trick or treat ? It's always Halloween , isn't it ? Every day .

And the first color shocker combines ... a side-wrap pleated skirt with an updated classic shirt ... which you will see throughout this line . That's Number 242 . And Number 243 ... Hey , who let you out ? A packable , washable , banaline ... designed to hold and flatter the figure . It has an elasticized bodice , a bare back ... This is the look that has made our line so popular in the past . Hell of a line , Phil . - How are you , Sid ? - I'm good , Phil , like always . I was watching those garments , they'll walk out of the stores . - Congratulations . - Thanks . - Phil , you got the gelt ? - Some . Big line , you'll get big orders , you'll need big money . - I suppose we will . - Suppose ? That ain't exactly a bar mitzvah you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . Hello , Sidney , how are they hanging ? They're hanging good , Harry , like always . How much you boys selling money for these days ? He has to ask me what the terms are . 12% on the unpaid balance , first of the month and then it graduates . Graduates ? I understand , it levels off about 200% ? - Well , another account ... - We'll let you know later ? Listen , you guys are in the middle . The banks , they ain't gon na give you shit . You make everything run , they don't grease you . Look around in there , you see any banks ? But we'll throw dice with you . Yeah , but we got a movie , we got ta see . Come on , Phil . Movie ? They haven't made a good movie in 30 years . - What do you say , fellas ? - We'll keep in touch , okay ? Goodbye , Sidney . What's that rot you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Havana . Smell the ocean , enjoy . - We'll talk to you later . Come on , Phil . - So long , Sid . Say , that's a nice suit , you're wearing , Harry . Passatti ? - Yeah . - Sid , thanks for the cigar . Nothing . That's a good sign . If the Mob sent Sid , the word must be out we have a hot line . The Mob has money for us and the banks don't . It's a great system . Well , I guess the bank figures if they don't give it to us the Mob will . The Mob would give it to us all right . Can you imagine living with their hooks into you ? - No worse than arson . - It's worse . Remember what happened to Georgie Kramer , a couple of years ago ? A 400 pound Turk walks in his office ... hangs him out a 13 story window by his ankles ... and says , "" Next time I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen one of these things . - What things ? - A blue movie . - Just life in a close-up . - Do they actually show everything ? What's to show ? A couple of naked bodies crawling all over each other ... some guy holding a camera hollering , "" Not yet , not yet . "" Yes , so what was he doing , in a gay bar ? You're putting me on ! So listen , how did you make out ? - Two , please . - $10 . What ? - $10 . - You're kidding . $5 a head . You want a pair or not ? What are you giving away ? The name of our attraction is Denmark Speaks . Been here for 18 weeks . Famous smorgasbord scene . Just a minute . You can have a private booth for $15 . - Do you qualify for Medicare ? - Yeah ? How about that . If you don't mind , ma'am , please , two tickets ? Let's go . The Danes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland . I remember years ago I saw Quo Vadis here and now they're playing this crap . It's still the same thing . They just took their togas off . ... but total joy in the penultimate seconds of orgasm . The young people in a totally liberated society ... demonstrate in this scene the magnificence of fallatio or oral sex . See how these young people are made happy ... by the slow feeling of one another ... - Nice suit . - Thanks . - Silk ? - Yeah . - Hong Kong ? - Rome . Nice . Thank you . Give it to me . Phil , give it to me . Here's the down payment , the key , and the address . Don't look at me . Watch the screen . What time is it vacant ? After 6:00 . What else is there ? Well , there's a shirt company on the ground floor ... - we're on the second floor , that's all . - Watch the screen , Harry . We're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump gasoline with a cigarette in your mouth ... just watch the screen . How old is the building ? Thirty-five ? Thirty-seven . I'll check it out tonight . Meet me here tomorrow , 10:00 a.m . - Right . - We don't want anyone hurt . You want to forget it , say so . We just don't want anyone hurt , understand ? Look at the screen , Phil . Please , let's net confuse morality with technology . You're not talking to some pyromaniac . I've set 15 major industrial fires across the country in the last three years . I've had two firemen overcome by smoke inhalation . They both recovered , received citations . If they 'd issue the new C-15 masks ... smoke wouldn't be a problem anymore anyway . They use them in France , you know . This is a science , gentlemen , an exact science . Whether or not to set the fire is a moral question . - That's up to you . - It's in your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here tomorrow , same pew . Nice suit , Harry . ... as you now witness ... You got to respect Charlie , all business . Phil , it is the only way out . ... helps demonstrate explicitly the amount of precision ... Let's go ! Harry , that man is a lunatic ! Sits there with his hands on his stomach and a glazed look in his eye . - He's the best , Phil . - I think we ought to go back to Sid ... - talk to him and make a deal ! - Phil , will you forget about Sid ? Behind that Havana cigar is a killer . Yes , but Sid's money can keep us going ! I am not gon na donate a year of my life paying 200% to any Mob ! Now , do you understand that ? I'm sorry . Go back to the office , will you ? Get together with Meyer and line out the orders . I'm gon na take a walk . I'll see you at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiger ? Only takes a signature . Only 556 of them left . Think we ought to keep them around , don't you ? Yeah . - How's Cuban Pete ? - Cuban Pete ? He took a walk , he feels great . How much did we write ? - A little over three . They ate it up . - What did I tell you ? I'm going home . You want to have dinner with us ? I don't think so . Can I borrow one of your shirts ? Help yourself . That's two you owe me . Salesmen are happy ? What 'd they say ? The usual , "" Can we deliver ? "" Meyer's going over the orders . He wants to see you . Well , with what we wrote discounted at the bank ... and Charlie , we're gon na squeeze through . I checked Swissair , they got a flight to Geneva , stops in New York . Good idea . You can see your daughter before we go to jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we got to get out of bed every morning . At least I don't get out of bed in Beverly Hills . Well , how I lead my life doesn't have anything to do with our business . Just takes a little pressure off when your nut isn't sky high . It's my pressure , Phil , my nut . Except when it spills off . Like this afternoon at the show . It's a criminal act , Harry ! What criminal act , Phil ? To keep people working ? That's what you yourself said this morning , isn't it ? Is it a criminal act to try to hang on to 15 years of hard work ? What the hell was our dream ? To meet a payroll and not a pay check . Wasn't that the dream ? That was the big slice of the pie . Everybody in this whole God damn country dances around the law , Phil . - Now what's a criminal act ? You tell me . - So the end justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the scoreboard , baby . - That's the way they play it . - Who's "" they ? "" We're "" they . "" - And there are rules . - Wrong . Used to be . No more rules , just referees . And no room out there for losers , believe me . You and me out on that street again ? Why , Christ ! What would we do ? Where would we go ? We're obsolete . You want logic , Phil . And there is no Ministry of Logic , in this country . Performance used to count , right ? For 15 years we've met our obligations with the same unions ... the same mills , the same bank , but today ... all they care about is the bottom line on a passbook ... and then some God damn machine gives you a bum credit rating . So history doesn't count anymore . It's our place , Phil , we don't get down on our knees to anybody . You expect me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , don't you understand ? It's people like us , people in the middle , that made this country work . And when people like ourselves get into this kind of thing ... it takes it all down . That's what's ripping the country apart ! Son of a bitch , don't you sell America , to me ! I've got friends over there sitting under the sand with bikinis on their heads ! I used to get goose bumps every time I looked at that flag . When I was a kid , sitting alone in the room playing the radio ... if they ever played the national anthem , I stood up all alone in the room . I stood up at attention . Don't sell me America ! Now they're making jock straps out of the flag . Maybe it's terrific . Maybe it's healthy , I don't know . But I do know there are no more rules . That stinks , Harry . Hello , Boss . - Don't call me Boss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got the accounts , you made it work . Don't call me Boss . How's everything looking ? I don't want to talk about the line . Meyer , I need Rico and I need you , now what do you want me to say ? Harry , I'm old . I can't be in a playpen with fairies . Even talented fairies . You have a job here till you die . But you need Rico . Tell me to get out . I don't want you out , Meyer . What do you want ? Come on , tell me . I'm listening . I'm an old stone . Tell me , what do you want ? Another season . That's all ? Another season ? Just survival ? No dreams ? No hope ? Hope ? Better ask the little old lady in Vegas with the Dixie cup full of nickels ... if she still has hope . She's still looking for the three cherries . I'm sorry . I'm sorry for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your life running from pogroms , Nazis . Bent over a machine . What the hell have you got ? I have my craft . My work . And a woman . Old , but still lovely . I like to look at her , to listen to her talk . So sweet . And it's every day . That's good . Yeah , that's good . Now get out of here . Let me work . I'll deal with the fairy . We've had our talk . Go to your mansion . Go to your Mexican cook .

Why do you compare your cars to airplanes ? Oh , I cook up missions all over the county ... keeps my head in the clouds . Anyhow , the Wildcat ... the thing about this plane was , it was the very first American fighter in the Pacific , which is where I fought in the war . Oh . Anyhow , right here ... step on over here . - Camilla : Oh , look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellcat . The car's name is Chevelle . You see it right there . Chevelle's a little quicker than GTO , handles better too . And the grand finale over here ... Oh , I love this one . Oh . It's something . - Does it go fast ? - Yeah , it does . - I bet it does . - They all do . Mm . Now the Corsair had 11:1 kill ratio . - This ... don't sit on it . - Oh . - Don't sit on it . - Terribly sorry . It's okay . Anyhow , the Corsair had 11 : 1 kill ratio and the Corvette ... 11 : 1 compression ratio . - Isn't that something else ? - Lt is . it really is . It's a beautiful , beautiful machine . I'll tell you what : I love this thing . Now see , notice how the hood's so long , that pretty hood , longer than the ass end so much , see ? Well , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . See there ? I do . Do you know you're like a little child when you talk about them ? What do you mean ? A kid can't fly these things . Well , it's just not any son of a bitch that can handle them . I mean , you can make a mistake pretty easy , believe me . Have I upset you ? They're beautiful . Yes , they are . I feel real strange about Mama . Dear Naomi ... what an eccentric creature she was . I wonder why she didn't tell us she was sick . She just didn't want you to worry . There was nothing you could do . Your accent sure is pretty . I could listen to you talk all day long . I need to smoke a reefer with my nephews . You want to go with me ? Yes , I do . Thank you . I noticed you didn't eat much . You don't like Daddy's cooking ? Oh , no , no , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'm sure it's wonderful , but I can only eat a very bland diet . How come ? I was a prisoner during the war , of the Japanese . The culinary skills of the Jap cooks left a lot to be desired . My insides were left a bit of a wreck . Oh . I'm sorry . I didn't mean to be nosy . No , that's quite all right . All three of my brothers were in the war . Carroll was in the marines . He was a medic . Skip was a pilot in the navy . They both got decorated . Jimbo was in the army , but he don't talk about it much . He ran the laundry at Fort Polk . He's so damn jealous of the other boys ' medals , you 'd think he was in high school . Well , he shouldn't feel that way . He did his bit . Yeah , try telling Jimbo that . Try telling Jimbo anything . He's Daddy's boy all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you married ? Divorced . Oh . You got any kids ? No . Is she pestering the shit out of you , Phil ? No , no , no , not at all . Neal , get me a beer . Well , shit , you got legs . Well , may I thank you for your hospitality , Mr . Caldwell ? The barbecue was superb . Yeah , well , see you tomorrow . Hey , sweet ass . Hey , come here a minute . Come here a minute . Yeah . Camilla : Hey , you're blotto . Hey , listen , there's something I was thinking about . I just want to ask you ... This English accent of yours ... there's something about it . There's just something about it . Now , uh , I know we don't know each other that good yet . And I'm sure that you're not gon na just actually do it with me yet , but ... But I was wondering sometime can we just slip off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don't know , and just let me beat off to you ? Beat off ? Um ... beat ... beat off . What , have a wank ? See ? That's what I'm talking about ... that damned English . Makes me hornier than Frank Sinatra . "" Have a wank ? "" You're mad as a March hare . I ain't mad . I just get real focused on things . - Think about it . - Okay . Goodbye . Skip : Hey , think about it . Dispatch : S.O . to 44A . Man over radio : 44A . Go ahead . Dispatch : Sheriff , are you still out at Good Frank's ? Give me a 10-84 to Mr . Meyer's . Jim : Mm-hmm , yeah . He's making threatening phone calls to neighbors , telling them he's gon na kill their cat . Caller advised of a possible 10-96 . Sheriff : All right . Dispatch : Unit 59 , 10-20 ? - Hey . - Hey , Daddy . - Hey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so far . - Yeah . - Yeah . it's all kind of hard to think about , huh ? What ? Are you gon na be okay tomorrow , you think ? Tomorrow ? Well , what about it ? The funeral . Dispatch : All units , we have a three-car accident - up on Lance highway ... - Yeah . - Yeah . - Four fatalities confirmed , several injuries , not real sure how many . It's a shame about ol ' Naomi , you know , it really is . Yeah . You ain't fooling me . Yeah ? I got ta go . There's a big wreck right down the road . - See you later . - Okay , Daddy . Man over radio : In five minutes . Lance highway - and Scott Ranch Road . Over . - Dispatch : 10-4 . Let's bring in that new mystery challenger . Woman : God bless you . Go on in . There you go . Well , yeah . Yeah . There you go . Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pops ? - Please . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Naomi . I forgive you this time . Bye-bye . There you go , Mama . Go on , buddy . Mama ? - Da ... Daddy ? - Hey , buddy , hey . - Daddy ? - Hey , it's okay . it's okay . Go on . Go get with Dad . Phillip : Father . - Camilla : Father . Oh my God . - Phillip : Okay . Donna : What ... ? - Carroll : Yeah , loosen his tie . - Father . Somebody get a doctor . - Give him some air . - Donna : Where's your phone ? Camilla : Father . Carroll : Hey , get some water . Man : There you go . Donna : Well , somebody ought to go with them . They're in a strange town . They don't know anybody . Donna , we're all headed over to the church now for your mama's funeral . All right ? Carroll : She's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Donna : Oh my God , I hope he's all right . What if he's dead ? Thank you . Neal : Broken teeth and bones and hair and shit ... I mean , it's the hardest fought game ... He's gon na pinch my last nerve . Neal : We got one point with one second to go - and you know what happens ? - I don't know . They missed the dang extra point ! Oh , hey , babe , did they get your mama buried all right ? - Yeah . - Hey , listen , I got ta get something else to eat . This thing tastes like shit . - How's your daddy doing ? - He's doing well . Thank you . He had a heart attack about three years ago , so of course we were worried about that . But the doctor said he just fainted because of the stress and exhaustion . He's resting now . And Camilla's with him . Oh , thank God . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd release him in ... in ... in a bit . But they don't want him to travel for a day or two , which means we ... we won't be leaving tomorrow . Well , he can't stay at the Pines Motel . I mean , none of y'all should be there in the first place . That ain't nothing but an after-prom fuck joint . No telling whose jizz y'all are sleeping on . Y'all are staying at Daddy's . That's very kind , but we couldn't possibly . Oh , yes , you could possibly . I think it's a great idea . Daddy would insist . Neal : All right , girls , let's go . We got shit to do . Phillip : Neal , thank you so much for your help at the hospital . Neal : Hey , no sweat , slick . Take care of yourself , all right ? Donna : Y'all drive safe . Call me when you get there . Hey , Neal , keep it on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those beers back there . - Aunt Donna . - Yeah ? Uh , Connell's band's playing tonight . Really ? Yeah , at the main dollar store parking lot . And I'm doing the sound and the lights . Uh , you ought to come . - All right . - All right ? - Okay , I'll see you later then . - I'll see you there . Okay . I feel like dancing anyway . Let's go dance . I should stay here with my father . You need to relax . There's a whole house full of people to take care of your daddy . Well , I'm not really a dancer . Well , you will be when I get through with you . Hey , what's going on ? Any gruesome car crashes ? Any homicides ? No , doesn't appear to be , no . Too bad . Hey , let me ask you a question . How cold can it be in there ? Is it really that dark and cold inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day of his mama's funeral ? You're drunk . Go home . Yeah . Hey , let me ask you another question . You remember when I was wounded on Saipan , I was in the hospital for three months ? Jim : Of course I do . Yeah , I wrote you a letter from that hospital . I spilled my guts out to you . I told you everything you ever meant to me , about how when I signed up , I became a medic ' cause you were a medic in World War I and ... and ... and how I didn't mind getting shot because ... ' cause I figured that you was finally , you know , proud of me and how I admired you more than anybody else in the world , even President Roosevelt . And you never wrote me back . I mean , you never said one word about that letter , not to this day . I never got a letter like that . You're lying , Pops . Donna told me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up or something . Your letter must have got lost , lost in the mail . You know , I used to think that you were seven feet tall . I spent my whole childhood just trying to be just ... just like you . God damn , I'm glad I didn't succeed . Hmm . Yeah . You turned out real good . Man : ? I came ? ? I saw ? ? He said ? ? He fled ... ? "" ' Forward , the Light Brigade ! Charge for the guns ! ' he said : Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred . "" "" Cannons to the right of them , Cannons to the left of them , Cannons in front of them Volley 'd and thunder 'd ; Storm 'd at with shot and shell , Boldly ... "" I'm glad you came and loosened up a little . Me too . I actually had fun . "" Cossack and Russian Reel 'd from the sabre-stroke Shatter 'd and sunder 'd . "" "" Then they rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Man , I got ta tell you something , but you can't tell a soul , especially my grandmother . Mickey : All right , man . Connell : I got a problem , man . What is it ? I mean , I really got a problem right now . All right . I got this in the mail today , thought you should check it out . Well , shit , man . What are you gon na do ? What do you think I'm gon na do ? Yeah . Come in . May I ? Oh , Mr . Caldwell . Yeah . I just wanted to see how you were feeling . A great deal better , thank you . Well , that's ... that's good . Good to hear . Yeah . Good night . Good night , Mr . Caldwell . Uh ... I got a question for you . Yes ? How did y'all meet ... you and Naomi ? Well ... I was taking my dog Molly for a walk in Hyde Park one morning ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had died a year previously . Molly had become my constant companion , always trying to lift my spirits . I noticed ... a very attractive woman standing by the bronze statue of St . George slaying the dragon . And she had a camera , obviously a tourist . And she spotted me and she asked me in a very attractive Southern American accent if I 'd care to take her picture . Of course I said I 'd be delighted . So she gave me the camera . And I was expecting her to stand in front of the statue and smile . I 'd take a snapshot of her , I 'd give her the camera back and we 'd go our separate ways , but not a bit of it . Not a bit of it . No , instead she absolutely astonished me by climbing on the back of the horse , sitting astride it behind St . George as quickly ... and as nimbly as a monkey . Sounds like her , yeah . I was laughing so much , I had difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I met Naomi . I just always wondered about it . Always wondered . Yeah . Hey , kid . What's up ? Just going outside for a smoke . You ? Just having my cereal . You're up early . Not really . I ain't been to bed yet . How come ? Connell and me were up all night talking . Connell got drafted . Shit . Does Dorothy know yet ? No , he ain't told her yet . Man . Poor thing . She loves that kid to death . It's weird , Daddy . How can government just come and tell you what to do like that ? He was gon na go to California , get in the music scene . - It's fucked up . - I know . it ain't right . I mean , that's why I'm telling you you got ta get in college . That's why I'm against it , you know ? So a kid like Connell that has a dream gets a chance to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool about it though ... Connell being a soldier . No , son . There's nothing cool about it . Jimbo : Well , looky there . Here we go . Nobody else is going to church . Why do we have to ? ' Cause we always go to church . Because we love the Lord . Well , we went to church yesterday . No , we didn't , God damn it . We went to a funeral . It's different . Hello . Hello . Good morning . ? And then the hydrogen atom , ? ? and good things are gone ... ? - Hi . - What are you doing ? Getting the car on ? I'm just fiddling around in here . What are you doing ? Oh . It's hot . - Skip : Yeah . - Very hot . So when are you gon na get naked and recite something to me in your accent , hmm ? Come on , tit for tat . No is not an acceptable response . - Listen , uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . Yeah . Kingsley , you heard of Jayne Mansfield ? - Jayne Mansfield ? - Yeah . Yeah , the film star , blonde with those ... Titties . That's right . That's right . Well , she was killed a couple of years back in a car wreck in Louisiana . And a friend of mine just called from town . They have the very car she was killed in out at the discount store . And they're selling tickets . And it's a big deal . And I darn near forgot it was today . Would you like to come with me ? Come on . All right ? - Oh . - Let's go . All right . How grotesque . it's a good spot . I come out here to do my thinking . I used to bring Patty Overton out here and just wear her ass out . That was before the war . She married a Primitive Baptist preacher . She was hare-lipped and you needed Grandpa's bifocals to see her titties , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God damn , she could take it right up to the gills without so much as a hiccup . Oh , I think she sounds like a lovely girl . Yeah . Right , enough beating about the bush . Let's get on with it , fly boy . I think a little Tennessee Williams would be appropriate . Do you know "" A Streetcar Named Desire "" ? You hear that ? No . I don't . Birds ? Silence . That's what was hard to get used to . It still is sometimes . It's kind of like floating on a peaceful lake with a tornado in your head or something . I never did want to see wrecks . I didn't want to know what somebody's last thought was before they died . I never wanted to see dead faces looking at nothing . I just wanted to fly . When I was a kid , I read books on it . Once in a blue moon one would fly over and I 'd watch it till it disappeared . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren't even in the war at that point . I just wanted to fly up there in the quiet and the still . I was a navy pilot . How about that ? It wasn't quiet and still though . It was loud and crazy and scary . But you went up every time you were supposed to , did what you were supposed to do . And I went up with three minds . One mind was always thinking , "" One way or the other , I'm gon na get back . I'm gon na make it back . "" And then another mind was always thinking , "" This is probably gon na be the last day of my life . "" And then your third mind was right down the middle and didn't think about anything . It wouldn't let the other two in . You know , people say they don't like to talk about war because it brings up the bad memories and the nightmares and everything . I don't believe that . I believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . See , in the early part of the war the Japanese were good pilots , better than we were really . Later on we got better , but ... I made a mistake that day . It was a clear blue day and he got in behind me and I got hit right here and back up there in the back . And I couldn't believe I 'd been shot . And at the same time I 'd been expecting it all the time , you know ? I ... one way or another ... I bailed out . I didn't want to . I was scared to . But I didn't want to burn to death . That's what we were mostly worried about up there . Yeah . You know how lucky I am ? No . I landed right in the middle of the goddamn US marines . It knocked me out . I broke my right leg , collarbone , a few ribs , pelvis , both hands . I don't remember a lot about it , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalcanal . I woke up in a hospital , had both my hands in casts and my right leg , just tore to pieces . And ... the hospital got hit . And I nearly burned to death . I saw a guy coming at me with a big ol ' wet blanket or something and he threw it over my head . I thought he was trying to kill me . But he saved my face , as Jimbo says , for what that's worth , and got me out of there . Carroll got to come visit me a couple of times . That's real special . And that was the end of the war for me . I mean , God damn , honey , you can't get out of your own skin no matter what it is . Anyhow , it takes five kills to become an ace . And I got six . I'm an ace . Skip . Uh , I didn't beat off . Come on , I know a place . Jim : Her and her boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night . The kids was in the back seat , didn't hardly even get hurt . A little ol ' dog of hers deader than Rin Tin Tin . Kingsley : Yes , I can remember when it happened . It's always shocking when the rich and famous die . There's no reason for us to believe that they should have immunity , - but we seem to . - Yeah . Yeah . You reckon how many people would live to ripe old age if we didn't go anywhere , ' cause transportation kills a lot of people . Yeah . What if the last thought in the world was , "" God damn it , here comes a car across the center line about to kill me , ' cause I had to get out at 10:00 at night for a roll of toilet paper . Well , I wish I would have just wiped my ass with a sweetgum leaf . "" Yes , I've been thinking a lot about last thoughts recently . I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in my sleep so there wouldn't be any conscious thoughts ... - Oh , that's good . - ... just a dream instead ... Yeah . - ... hopefully a good one . - Yeah . Yeah . Three , please . Whew . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Move over , son , so we get a better look . Yeah . Mm . There it is . Whew . Mm . Yeah . What they said was , there was ... the car was headed through a road in the swamps . And there was a mosquito truck on the road spraying pesticide . And it comes drifting across the road like a cloud , just this fog of poison . And this tractor trailer rig slowed down when it hit the fog . And Jayne Mansfield's car slid right under it . That was it . That was all she wrote . Yeah . Mm . She was decapitated , wasn't she ? A lot of people think that , but it wasn't the whole head . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kingsley , you spend a lot of your time figuring things out ? You know , Jim , these days I think I spend more time accepting things . Not me . I spend all of my time figuring things out . Yeah . Boy : That ain't her real head . Shit , don't you think I know that ? My daddy says it's probably not even really her car . Ain't you got anything better to do than to pester me ? Huh ? Huh ? That's right . Yeah . - I'll be in the truck . - Yeah . Well , mm , seen enough ? Just about . Just about . Whew . Mm . Mm . Jim : Yeah . A dead man's stare ain't any different than that plastic head's stare . Ain't nothing in either one of them . I saw it on the battlefield many times . I'm sure you did too . Yes , I'm afraid I did . The fact is we all have a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear that ? Yeah . Yeah . I put pieces together all the time and they all fall apart . Before I can ever get it all put together , they all fall apart . Jim : That's it exactly . Everything's been turned upside down . Yeah . Listen , I love my boys , but for the life of me I can't figure them out . Jimbo is a good hand around here , turned out normal , didn't even see combat . The other two was out-and-out heroes , turned out to be hardly naught but hobos . You think it 'd be the other way around . Yeah . Yes , well , I have to say that Phillip has been a bit of a disappointment to me too . Yeah , well , times are changing . Good life's disappearing . Sometimes I pray I'm not here to see it go . Oh my God , do you believe them ? They're acting like long-lost buddies . I know . I'm amazed . Jim : Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsley : it's really quite a storm . Jim : Rest your bones . Vicky : Look at them . No telling what they was up to while we was at church . Jim : Yeah . Phillip : I'm gon na go freshen up . Donna : Well , hey , sister Vicky . Let's take a walk . Donna : We had fun riding . It's about my sister . - Jim : You what ? - Donna : We had fun riding . You need to leave her the fuck alone . Well , now , see here , I don't know what you're getting at . No , no , no , no , I'm ... I'm not pissed off at you . I don't even like you . I only get pissed off at people I like . There's nothing in this for me . This is for your own damn good . Don't get mixed up with her . The power's out ! Jim : See what I got to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ain't a bad gal sometimes . But she can suck you down in the hole you'll never be able to crawl out of . Neal used to be a slim , muscular , good-looking , humble guy . Now he runs his mouth off like a threshing machine just so he doesn't have to hear himself think . And if you look at him , he can't even hardly squeeze into a damn leisure suit , eats whatever you put in front of him , drinks two cases of beer a day . Donna : Like all the shit you done . Jimbo : You want to have some spending money in your pocket ... - Jim : Careful , careful . - ... and not to have to work like a slave , keep your sanity , let her be . She's tricky . She's as whiny as a two-week-old cat . Jimbo : I ain't even sure them's his daughters . Jim : ... stop and see what's going on now . - Jimbo : Get me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They call it free love . It's a free ride is what it is . Kingsley : What astounds me is the lack of respect . You know , the people that we fought and that died next to us ... if they were to see what was going on today , they would literally spin in their graves . It's just a crying shame . While our boys are fighting in the jungle , the hippies are ... they're singing songs and pissing on our flag . Well , don't they realize that there is a rising tide of communism that's going to sweep up onto our shores and overwhelm us if it's not stopped in places like Southeast Asia . Exactly what I've been telling Carroll , word for word . Phillip : This war is not about communism . It's about nationalism . The Vietnamese people just want to be free of foreign domination ... first the French , and now the Americans . Jim : We ain't trying to dominate anybody . We're just trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun ? Kingsley : Yeah , well , sometimes violence is a necessary evil . That's right . That's right . It was my turn in ' 17 . And then Carroll and Skip had to go off after Pearl Harbor . And pretty soon , well , it's gon na be Alan's turn . We need to keep Alan around here . We got ta groom him to take over one of these days . Jim : Well , now there's plenty of time for that . What , you want him to come home with a chest full of medals too , or get killed ? Or both . Hey . Well , I'm just glad I got girls and not boys . Phillip : Don't you think you've had enough , Father ? I mean , you're just a day out of hospital . I've had quite enough of you hectoring me about my drinking . It's one of the few pleasures that I have left . And also I've had quite enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I'm no expert , but I do know something about war . I was a soldier too . Oh , yes . I 'd forgot . Yes , you fought in the glorious battle of Singapore . - The Nips surprised us . - Yeah ? Our heavy artillery was pointed seaward and they came up behind us through the jungle . And we surrendered to a force a third the size of ours ... the most disgraceful defeat in British history . And Phillip was a part of it . It was a botched business , I admit . Yes , well , coward Percival should have been court-marshaled , short . General Percival was a brave and honorable man . The situation was hopeless . The fact is , Phillip , you spent the war as a prisoner , as a mere slave of the Japs , not as a soldier . But I survived when a great many of us didn't . I think I should receive some credit for that . Kingsley : Oh , the will to live is very powerful even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I surrendered because I was ordered to surrender . You didn't have to surrender ! You could have gone off into the jungle and fought as a guerilla . You haven't the faintest bloody idea what you're talking about ! Yeah . I am astonished . What makes you think that you can speak to me in this fashion ? What makes you think you can sit there and spout drunken nonsense and not be called upon it ? Well , face the truth , Phillip . You're lazy and you drift through life and then you blame everything on the war . You're insane . I've never blamed the war for anything . Kingsley : You really do live in a fantasy land . Fantasy ? You are a pompous old dinosaur that's outlived his time . I think those Japanese guards kicked you too many times in the head . I really must apologize . I have behaved very poorly . Don't worry about it . I have busted a few glasses in my day . Jim : Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing , Skip ? I came to see you . Just go put a shirt on , get you some ice cream or something and go to bed . Yeah . You remember me being a kid ? Well , hell yes , you was good one time , so I remember . Yeah . You remember when I was a little bitty kid ? I just said , yes , I do . Now you're my damn kid but , God damn it , I'm going through some business papers . Just get you an ice cream now . Go to bed . You remember any stories about me when I was little ? You remember anything , like one time when you and me had a conversation sometime , something like that ? Anything ? I mean , just some story about me when I was a little kid , you know ? ' Cause , you know , Mama told me one or two last time I saw her . What did she tell you ? Well ... she told me one about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to tie him to a tree while they fed the chickens and put the wash up . Jim : Mm-hmm . They called him Precious . Mm-hmm . Yeah . The power's back up . Put your shirt on . Go find something to do . Yeah . All right . Turn that music down ! Donna . ? Please , fantasy ? ? Please stay with me ... ? I put a shirt on , Daddy . Boy , you sure did , didn't you ? Mm-hmm . ? My reality ? ? Stay close to me ? ? Stay , fantasy ? ? Please stay ... ? Boy , I must have been something else when I was a kid . Yeah . Donna : What are you thinking about ? Phillip : I'm not sure . Well , there's no way it wasn't gon na happen . Doesn't it feel good to live ? Yes . Yes , it feels good to live . Well , you don't seem too happy about it . Don't get all English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that wasn't good . No . No , I can't tell you that . Quit being so weird . You are thinking something bad , aren't you ? It's not fair to be acting so weird and not tell me what it is . Talk to me . I'm just tired , just very tired . Don't make excuses . Tell me . Okay . Those things my father was saying about me , about the war ... I was a prisoner , a slave , but I was still a soldier . God . That's what you were thinking about ? Not about me or about just now ... you know , about us ? You wanted to know . Well , the war's over . And daddies are daddies . They're always yelling and saying shit . I don't want you to think about anything else tonight but me . I'm sorry , but you insisted . No way you could really understand anyway , there's really not . Hey , don't treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you really spend the whole war as a prisoner ? You didn't ever fight ? It depends on what you mean by fighting . Fighting the enemy , shooting , jumping from foxhole to foxhole ... not too much . Fighting to survive every crawling , filthy , miserable , horror-filled minute ... yes . Yes , I fought . Where are you going ? I just want a cigarette . The storm didn't last long . They never do . Probably way off in the next county by now . Camilla : My father's a monster . Skip : Yeah , Daddy's a monster too . - Skip : You watch much TV ? - No . - Hey , Daddy . - Hey . I heard you and Kingsley are going hunting . Yeah . We're gon na go out ... out around Ten Mile Creek . But it ain't hunting season . In my places it's always hunting season . I'm proud of you . How come ? Wha ... ? Because of how nice you've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for 20 years , blamed him for ruining my life . Yeah . - What changed ? - Well ... it started at the funeral home when they rolled him out to the ambulance . I looked at him on that stretcher ... a strange town , a long way from home , just ... his wife just died , he's thinking maybe he's fixing to die too ... and I just thought , "" Well ... "" "" ... that poor devil . "" it was like I wasn't mad no more . What is that ? Ice tea , hon . I made some for your grandpa . He and Sir Kingsley are going hunting . Made some hot tea for Sir Kingsley . Want a sip of tea ? Eh ? Not yet . Not yet . I'm thirsty . There was a Civil War battle fought not far from here , called the Battle of Ten Mile Creek . - Really ? - Yeah .

That was Alan . He's been tripping since last night and this morning put some in Grandpa's ice tea . Why would he do that ? ' Cause I told him . I said it 'd be a good idea . Fucking dude . Actually I've got a very funny hunting story about Phillip when he was a small ... Hold on , hold on . Hold on . - Sorry ? Beg your pardon ? - Hold on . What's ... ? What's happening ? What's happening ? Kingsley : How do you mean ? Yeah . Everything feels funny . A little wiggly . Do you feel a little wiggly ? Jim , are you all right ? Everything's changing ... the ground , the trees , the sky . The leaves like a wave . And ... I don't have any balance . I don't have any balance . Please tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving leaves up yonder , see ? ' Cause I don't know what ... I don't know what's going on or where I'm at . Look , look , we've got to get you back home .

How did you get behind ... behind our lines ? I got a whole company of men right behind that curtain over there , you sorry sack of Hun shit . Drop that weapon ! Jim , have you ... have you gone completely mad ? - Jim : Yeah . - What ? I'm not a German , Jim . It's Kingsley . German Jim Kingsley ... good alias . Is that how you got back here , Mr . Alias ?

Who do you think you's fooling , you cabbage head ? Open your mouth . No , I'm ... I'm English . We fought on the same side . But it's not the Great War now . It's 1969 . So please , please , please put the gun down . Oh my God . Kingsley : Heavens . Jim ! Where's Daddy ? Is he back yet ? He's hunting with the old man Bedford . What's going on ? Alan put LSD in Daddy's ice tea . - He fucking what ? - Donna : Where did Alan get LSD ? Did he say where he was going ? Yeah , they're out along Ten Mile Creek . Okay , come on , come on . Let's go . Let's go . - Get your truck . - Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Daddy ! Hey , Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Daddy ! - Carroll : Hey , Daddy ! - Father ! - Daddy ! Y'all , shut up .

Come on , Kingsley . Jim : Get your skinny little ass in here ! - Thank God . Are you all right ? - Yes , yes , I'm all right . Poor Jim has completely lost his mind . Jim : Uh-oh , here comes the police . What are y'all looking at ? Phillip : What on earth happened ? Kingsley : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . Jim : Come on in . I love it . I love it . Jimbo : You got a 70-some-odd year old man out there ! He could have hurt himself ! Alan : I didn't know he was gon na be going hunting . Jimbo : Son , he's out there running around the woods with a gun ! He could have killed that goddamn Englishman ! Alan : Yeah , but he didn't , Dad . It's okay . God . Jimbo : Boy , it ain't about what he didn't do ! It's about what it could have been ! Kingsley : Oh , well . Jimbo : What the hell has gotten into you ? I raised you better than this , boy . Did you think of me ? Did you think of your mama ? What do you think your mama's gon na think of this ? How is he ? Alan : Exactly what I was thinking . - About the same . - ... you had to live with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the drug to wear off . Alan : You don't ever care about nobody but what you want . Jimbo : Son , I'm gon na tell you right now , I would never do that to my father ! I'm glad you're safe though , Father . Jimbo : I would never do that to my father ! I was worried about you . Jimbo : How the hell could you do that ? Nothing to worry about . I've been in tighter spots . Jimbo : You're disrespecting me right now ! You're gon na be grounded forever ! - You understand ? - Phillip ... - Alan : You can't ground me . - Jimbo : I sure as shit can ! - Last night I ... - Alan : I'll just run away ! I think I said some things I didn't really mean . - I didn't either , Father . - Alan : You ain't gon na hit me ! Alan : You ain't gon na hit me ! Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand me ? Alan : I'm going away to Carroll's . Let's just put it behind us and go on . Jimbo : You get your ass up to that room . Get your ass up to that ... Alan : You can't tell me what to do ! - Kingsley : Oh , yes . - Jimbo : I sure as shit can . As long as you're in this house ... - Go on . - ... you're mine ! Alan : Well , I hate this house ! And I fucking hate you ! Jimbo : Better don't come out till I tell you to come out ! My billfold got wet in the creek . Take all the stuff out , spread it all out and dry it . - Okay ? - Okay . - See ? - Where is it ? It were in there . Yeah . Just dry everything ... my license and whatnot ... and that damn letter of yours . - I don't understand . - What ? All these years you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant something to you ? it's not gon na kill you to talk to your kids , Pops . You might be surprised what happens . What's the matter with your head ? Huh ? I can't ! I can't breathe ! I can't breathe ! - Daddy , Daddy . - I can't breathe . Daddy , it's Jimbo . I'm right here . - I can't breathe . - I'm right here . Let's get you up . Come on . I can't breathe . I can't breathe . Skip , don't just stand there . - It's swelling me up ! - Get over here and help me . - I can't breathe ! - Let's take him outside . Come on . It's pretty to look at , but it ain't good fire though ! I can't breathe ! Motherfucker ! I can't breathe ! Hey ! I can't breathe ! - Come on , Daddy . - I can't breathe ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can't breathe ! - Come on . - I can't breathe ! Watch that step , Daddy . - You steady him , Skip . - What's that ? I'm gon na go make some more coffee . All right . Did you need me to hold you up , Daddy ? Uh , hold yourself up . Skip . Yeah . Yeah . You know , there was a ... there was a time when everybody I looked at looked like pigs with hollowed out eyes . And everything was kind of yellow . Yeah . Is that when you was in the war ? No , about 10 minutes ago , or maybe it was yesterday . I'll be darned . Yeah . Yeah . Hey , you see down there where that fence goes along with the driveway , looks like a big rubber band , you know ? Huh ? No , sir . I can hardly see anything out there , to tell you the truth . Well , I was putting barbed wire up along there . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you helping me . And I got all tangled up . I ended up falling , getting all rolled up in it . And it was all stuck in my hair even , my shirt and my pants . And I asked you to help me get out of it . And you started bawling and run off . I said , "" Why , you little shit . "" And in a minute or two you come back just hauling ass , still crying , with a pair of wire cutters . I said , "" God damn , Skip , I done got wire cutters right here . I just need you to help me get out of this . "" You ... you always ... you always panicked when somebody got hurt . You never could see anything get hurt , you never did . Yeah . You said I was about seven or eight ? Yeah . - What are you doing ? - Huh ? What are you doing ? I was just kind of putting my arm around you a little . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Are you wet ? - Wet ? - Yeah . No , sir . I'm ... Do you feel wet ? Jimbo : if we was Old West outlaws ... I was thinking about this the other day ... I 'd be Jesse James , Carroll would be Pat Garrett ... Skip , you 'd be Billy the Kid . Carroll : Pat Garrett wasn't an outlaw . Jimbo : Yeah , he was . He changed his mind and he switched over . How come I 'd have to be Billy the Kid ? Jimbo : ' Cause . Because he was just a dumb-ass who got lucky and killed a few . There's this one picture of him . I saw it . He's lopsided . Looks like he's licking the snot off his nose . What if I throw a low , hard one down there , bounce it up in your nuts ? How would you like that ? Jimbo : I don't think I 'd like that too much . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit . Carroll : Hey , can we take a break ? ' Cause I'm tired of just standing here . I don't know about you . Hey . - What ? - Hey . Oh . One of the dogs has been shitting on the porch . I think it's this damn Penelope . Where did everybody go ? Well , Jimbo's out back someplace there . No , I mean , where's the Bedfords ? Well , they left already about an hour ago . Yeah . - They left ? - Yeah . Well , why didn't anybody wake me up ? I reckon nobody thought about it . Good girl . Well , what did they say ? They said , "" Bye . We had a good time , "" you know , stuff like that . Dorothy gave them some chicken and biscuits to eat on the road . - Well ... - Good girl . Did anybody say , "" Tell Donna goodbye "" - or something ? - Not that I remember , no . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Don't shit over there now . Uh , I 'd better see what Jimbo's up to . Okay . Jim : Yeah . It'll be good to get home , hmm ? Yes , Father . Well , Skip , you finally got some decent pussy , didn't you ? Well , maybe I'm in love with her . What do you think of that ? - What ? - I'm sorry , buddy . I'm sorry , that's just funny for some reason . Hey ... - Nah . - Shit , man , Daddy did acid . - No . - He said he figured out everything he ever wondered about . Then he said that when he puked he forgot all of it . Hey , Jimbo , what did you put in Mama's casket ? I saw you put something in there . It's just something between me and her . Come on , man , what was it ? It was a letter I wrote her and never sent her . Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don't think I never smoked dope before ? What do you think I am , a caveman ? Shit . I just don't like it . It ain't good for me . I start thinking the FBI is chasing after me . My heart starts racing so fast , I'm worried it's not gon na stop till I'm dead . Hey , Jimbo , me and Carroll ... we don't care that you never did see combat , just so you know . We really don't . I mean , you're our brother and we love you to death and you're our flesh and blood , you know . And we're glad you didn't . There ain't no reason to be jealous about it . You don't have any idea . So , um ... you ought to be happy about it . I mean , me and Carroll's proud of what we did and everything , but it's a goddamn nightmare , Jimbo . So you ought to just let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of as normal . Me and him can't , you know . I mean , you see how Daddy treats us . What little sleep I get , I wake up thinking I'm on fire . Now how would you like that ? God damn , buddy , I love you to death , but sometimes , man , you can really fuck up a free meal . Now what did you have to say that for ? I mean , he was actually smoking with us and talking to us . Now why did you have to say that , man ? It just felt right . Here . Put this on your face . Now that's why you 'd be Billy the Kid . He got shot when he was 21 for being too big for his britches and not thinking . You just need to think sometimes before you open your mouth . I do think , Jimbo . No , you don't . I try not to . Hey , hey , let's go get some cheeseburgers and go hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Let's go . You drive . You shitting me ? No . Go ahead . Carroll : Are you sure , buddy ? Yeah . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let's do it . Skip : Jimbo , stop . Stop the car . Stop the car . God damn it . I c ... I'm sorry . I'm sorry , Jimbo , it just don't feel right . Jimbo : Well , God damn it , Skip . Daddy . Hey . What's up ? I went to the recruiting office yesterday when you were over at Grandpa's and I joined the army . The sergeant said they'll keep me and Connell together . Everybody in the family did it , Daddy . I saw this picture of some guys in ' Nam hanging out with some palm trees , with their shirts off and guns slung over their shoulders . Looked so fucking rock ' n ' roll . I want to do something cool , Daddy . I don't want to rot here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? What were they thinking ? ? ? And what were they drinking ? ? ? Were they leaving ? ? With any regrets ? ? ? Were they achieving ? ? What they were believing ? ? ? Did they pay off ? ? All of their debts ? ? ? My head's in the clouds ? ? Anytime there's bad weather ? ? Wondering if storms ? ?

The end is just really ? ? The start ? ? I spend all my time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart ? ? We'll all go through the ? ? portal ? ? Yeah , no one's immortal ? ? But the time and the place ? ?

Yes , please . - We'll fix it or get you another . - He's my bunny . I want to keep it . Sam , I'm sorry . Why Tyrannosaur ? What ? About your wife . Tyrannosaurus or something ? Oh , Tyranno ... Right , yeah . It was ... It was just a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , the movie ? Do you remember there's a scene in the car , the kids are scared and they're looking at the glass and you hear the Tyrannosaur coming ? As it thumps its way towards them , the glass starts to ripple . So , my wife was a big lady . You 'd hear her going up the stairs . And it was like boom , boom , boom , boom . And I swear if I put a cup of tea on the sideboard , you 'd see the same ripples in my tea . So I called her the Tyrannosaur . I thought it was funny . I was being a cunt . - Did you love her ? - Mm-hm . And I hated her as well . She was a simple lady . Had this naive faith in people . Would forgive anyone for anything . Used to drive me fucking nuts . So full of forgiveness and love ... And I stomped the love out of her . I'm not proud of it . I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . - Do you wish she was still here now ? - No . - I 'd still treat her like a dog . - Why ? Cos I'm not a nice human being . I don't agree . I think you're a good person . You don't know anything , girl . I feel safe with you . Nobody's safe with me . Hey there ! How you doing ? Hope you don't mind . I wanted to cook something for you to say thank you for looking after me . And , erm , I've got something in here . Just to brighten the place up a bit and to say thank you . Are you Ok ? Sorry . I didn't want to force it on you . I just wanted to say thanks . You're fucked . Sorry ? I took your keys . I went to your house . I wanted to sort this shit out . I saw him . Yeah . Was he there ? What did he say ? A load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you done , girl ? What ... what's wrong ? What are you looking at ? Who the fuck are you to judge me ? You know nothing about me ! You don't know what that bastard did to me ! He ... He raped me . Oh , God ... He put things inside me . He put glass inside me . I wanted to have babies . All I wanted was to have babies and to be a mummy . Oh , God ! Help ! Please help . Will you hold me ? Will you hold me , please ? No ... Please ... Heavenly Father , help me . Dear Hannah . It's taken me a while to put this together . I'm not so great at writing letters , but I wanted to get in touch . Life's been mad for me in the past 12 months . Been awful sick for a number of reasons . I don't know if it got in the papers to you , but Samuel got attacked by that dog . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggy wound up so much that it turned on the nearest thing to it . Give me that fucking bunny ! It happened to be my buddy's face . Fucking thing nearly got chewed up . I could see it coming . An animal can only take so much punishment and humiliation before it snaps , fights back . That's its nature , you know ? I felt responsible for the boy . But I was trying to turn over a new chapter in my life . Events sent me a bit gaga . And my head just went . That is the second little dog I've killed . I'm not proud , cos I love dogs . But it had to be done to even things up in my mind a bit . Think I went a bit native . That's what Tommy told me . No ! "" You went native . "" My fucking dog ! And I thought that sounded about right somehow . Fuck ! You fucking cunt ! I'll fucking kill you ! I'm gon na fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You sick fucker ! Come on ! Come on ! You wan na go to war ? It was my fucking doggy , man ! I'll fucking kill you ! Come on ! That's my baby . He's killed my fucking baby , man ! That's my doggy . My fucking baby , man ! So I did get a bit of time for it . Got a lot of letters from people who said : "" Well done . Good on you . I 'd have done the same thing . "" But nobody ever does . They all think it , but I do it . That's the difference between me and you and the rest of the world . When I got out , I thought I 'd make a new start . I don't do the drink like I used to . I just decided enough was enough . I put flowers on my Pauline's grave every week . I prayed for you the other day . It's not something I do , but I found I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that shite , as you well know . I 'd like to come and see you . There's things I want you to know . You asked me once about why I went in the shop , but I never told you . I didn't go in there looking for God . I wanted you . Apart from Sam , you were the only person that smiled at me around here . And I wanted it . I wanted it to soak into me and brighten me up . And I thought you were beautiful . I just wanted to look at you , that's all . Didn't want to know you . Because I knew if I got to know you , you 'd have your own shite . You wouldn't be perfect , and I didn't want that feeling ruined . And boy , was I right . Anyway , I'm signing off now . My address is on this letter , so write to me if you feel like it . No pressure . - Hannah . - Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ? Hang up my skin to dry ? We were wasted , son ? We were wasted , all ? On the ride ? From the nightclub to our drive ? All the way we sank ? And from the flat ? Above the square ? We watch our comrades bare ? Their teeth , their souls , their flesh ? We were wasted , son ? We were wasted , all ? On the ride ? From the nightclub to our drive ? All the way we sank ...

I'm not mentioning any names , but I have two wrapped up in the rest home right now . I bet I can guess who one of them is . - Is it ... - never mind . Never mind . Well , don't you let her get away with that . I went to school with her . You know , Lucille , I admire your attitude and I agree with you . What God intended .

Everybody's beginning to see things as they are , aren't they ? Well , some of us , father , are not so much interested in seeing things as they are , as we are in seeing things the way we 'd like them to be . Well , just as long as you 'd like them to be for the old red , white , and blue , it's all right with me . Well , Dr . carver , nobody can ever say that we weren't brought up on those good old American bromides . Well , the bromides can come in pretty handy sometimes , can't they , doc ?

Now , keep us going down there . Doctor , you know in my catechism and cookie days around here , I'm afraid I took you rather for granted . Oh ? But I think you'll be interested to know that I've learned to take my hat off to science and to research . Uhhuh . Well , we fellas , that is , fellas smarter than I am , uncover a lot of things that are new , and different , and progress making . But more and more , some of us are beginning to realize that someone put them there for us to discover . Someone put them there . Yes , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find , kind of like an old-fashioned egg hunt , huh ? To discover something is great , but the wonder of creation ... you know , doc , I follow you . I see what you mean . Columbus discovered America , but he didn't put it here . Of course , Columbus is a great hero to us , but I'll bet you that the Indians weren't impressed with him . Well , how could they be ? ' Cause they were here before he was . Did you ever think about that ? No , father , no , but I will . Well , I'll see you all in the bomb shelter . So long . So long , doc . I'm all ready , Dan . Uh-huh , well , you better be . Been having a little trouble with your father lately . You ought a hear him yak when I'm late . Is that so , mother ? Here's your hat , father . Still active , father ? Well , you're darn right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I , mother ? No , he hasn't , John . Our attendance has doubled recently and we're alert . We have to be . We've been holding some special meetings , son , and every now and then we send out for ... more beer ? No , John . We send out for a speaker , someone whom we feel knows more than we do about what goes on in the world today . We ask a lot of questions and ... and we're getting awful smart awful quick . Were you gon na say something , mother ? Oh , I was going to say that if your father's singing at eleven , we ... father's singing ? Will we be able to get a seat ? There might be a line .

I've been following your career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Joseph's . Oh , thank you , father . Good work , John , good work . And speaking of good work , your mother and her ladies sodality have been more than generous to me . Only last week , they gave me a brand new stove . You should have seen the old one . We had to pay the junk man to throw it in the ravine . Your mother and the sodality , they're always doing things like that for me . That's a nice life you have , father . What's that , John ? We take care of you in this world and you promise to take care of us in the next , huh ? Washington hasn't changed his sense of humor , has it , father ? What do you hear from the other boys ? Well , nothing as yet . Why don't you , um , pull the car around in front ? Sure , all right . We enjoyed your sermon very much , father . Didn't we , John ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ... how you took a little story about the mustard seed and developed it for 20 minutes . It was wonderful . Should we go , mother ? Goodbye , father . Nice to see you . Going to be able to spend much time with us , dear ? Oh , I intend to , mother . Would you mind stopping , letting me off at teachers college , father ? I won't be long , mother . I've been expecting that . Can't wait to see old , uh , Professor , uh , toosis , can ya ? Can't even remember his name . I just want to pay my respects and get his advice on a talk I'm giving to the graduating class at my old Alma mater . Why , John , what an honor . Could we be there ? We 'd be so proud , wouldn't we ? Mmhmm . Well , it's an awfully long trip , mother , and time is so short . I'll send you the speech and you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , take a left at the next corner , father . Do you know that you can fly 500 Miles in 2 hours ? We could fly and hear John . How ' bout surprising him , Dan ? Fly ? You and I ? Everybody flies nowadays . We ought a keep up with the times . Dr . carver said I should be nice to you , didn't he ? Mmhmm . Wouldn't cost too much , would it ? Oh , I should say not . I hear some irishman advertising on the radio every day . ? You can fly any place in the United States ? ? diddle-diddle-Dee- diddly-diddly-doo ? ? and travel by air is much cheaper , too ? ? phone wasuch too-ra-loo-ra-loo ? ? I'll do it for you . But he didn't invite us . We're lowbrow . He'll probably invite his highbrow Professor . But he can have his highbrow professors , ' cause if he prefers the ... what's the matter with ya ? I might ask you the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breaks bad ? I just had ' em fixed . You stopped . I didn't stop , I just slowed down . I had to see what street this was . Well , you must be a stranger around here . Yeah , yeah ... I don't care where you're from , they don't drive like that . Well , we don't have to get in a big hassle about it . You just bent my Fender a little bit there . Well , here's my driver's license right there and here's my insurance card . We don't need to go into all that . Oh , yes , we do . You drive like an idiot . Well , I guess she's right . That's my little wife . How do you do ? Well , uh , no hard feelings . No hard feelings . We'll just forget all about it , huh ? Mother , you shouldn't have waited up ! Wanted to . But I asked dad specifically to tell you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it's kind of like old times . Waiting up for me to come home , isn't it ? I had a little work to do anyway . Now , come on in . Come on in , son . There's your ... your old chair . Sit down , sit down . Take the load off your feet . Yes . Remember how you used to sit there reading all night long and I 'd come down in the morning and find you sound asleep . We still have some of your old books . Oh , mother , I'm terribly sorry about dinner , but when the Professor and I get together , you know , I haven't seen him in a year . You haven't seen us either . He means that we've just been dying to talk to you , too . Why don't you talk to your father for a little while ? I have some ... I'll be back in a minute . Oh , you're wonderful , mother . Too bad that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben and Chuck off . Those two are a riot . Yes , mother wrote me all about it , father . Oh , she did , huh ? Well , did she tell you about Chuck ? Mmhmm . Eight pages , both sides . What's the matter with you , son ? I mean , you seem nervous about something . Is something bothering ya ? Feel fine . Maybe a little tired . Well , why don't you go on up to bed now and go to sleep ? We can talk anytime . Let's talk . I'm looking forward to talking to you , father . Talk , talk . You know me , John . All I know is what I read in the papers . In the local papers , huh ? Well , our local paper's not so bad . Our editor pulls off many a witticism . I'm sure , father . You just thought of one ? Yeah . Yes , he had a ... he had a good one in there yesterday about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he steals the ... he steals the results of next year's election . You know , every day he puts one of those in a little box . In a little box . Did I miss out on something ? Oh , mother . Father still has his sense of humor . You still teaching at the little red schoolhouse , father ? Oh , yes , yes . Still teaching them the same down to earth ... - fundamentals . - That's right . - Dan's been - working on his speech for the legion . He's running for commander of the post . Maybe he could help you with it , huh ? - Who ? - John . Well , I 'd love to , father . You know , add some little colorful touches . Put some bows on it . Why do I want some bows on it for ? Oh , well , father , she doesn't mean that . I think mother means that maybe you 'd like to take advantage of your investment in me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Uh , my subject is , "" where are we headed ? "" Hm , well , where are we headed , father ? That's what I 'd like to know , son . Well , how can you tell them what you 'd like to know ? I've got it . You've got what ? What do you mean ? That's what I 'd like to know is what you mean , father . Where are we headed ? I know where we're headed . Well , good . So far , you haven't said anything yet that's gon na get you any votes . But don't worry , I've got it . It's all here , it's packed with dynamite . Well , it sure is loud . Well , it might be loud , yes . You ought a come over , it 'd do ya good . Here's some of the singing that we do at the finish because we've got one particular song that I 'd love to walk into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full blast . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to your home o'er the sea ? ? to the land from whence you came ? ? no matter what its name ? ? but don't be ungrateful to me ? ? if you don't like the stars in old glory ? ? if you don't like the red , white , and blue ? ? then don't act like the cur in the story ? ? don't bite the hand that's feeding you ? ? Oh , father . Rousing words . Great , father . Oh , I'll read your speech . Oh , gosh , I've got to learn this . We've got ta do it together . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to the land o'er the sea ? ? I didn't get your name , go back from where you came ? ? and don't be ungrateful to me ? ? Mother ! I thought you might like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I thought you might get hungry , stranger . You still eat , don't you ? You're working on father's speech ? Mmhmm . Making a few suggestions . Good . I want to talk to you . Tell me all about yourself , tell me about everything . Can't we talk just a little bit , like old times . Of course , mother , why not ? I don't know . But somehow I just have a feeling that we're not as close this time as we always were . What's happened to my boy ? Well , he's grown up , mother . Boys do grow up , you know ? You're aware of the silver cord , mother . It must be severed , you know . Yes , I was there at the time . Oh , John , let's you and me talk sense . Silver cord , fiddle-Dee-Dee . I ... I don't want to intrude , but we don't have to be strangers either , do we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you got a girl ? Well , sentimentalizing over the biological urge isn't really a guarantee of human happiness , dear . Ah . Now you've got me as mixed up as you had your father . Oh , and speaking of ... you were rude to your father tonight , John . No , I think you're wrong . Oh , no , I know your face , John . I've looked into it too many years not to know it . I know every line . Every curve of that mouth . Been stealing any pennies lately ? You're not going back that far , are you ? You haven't forgotten ! Oh , no . Oh , how everybody thought you were so sick when you didn't go to school . I knew what was bothering you . I brought you right into this room , didn't I ? - Right here . - Yes and I said , "" it's all right , John , I was saving them for you anyway . "" And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden you weren't sick anymore . You've got to begin to accept the fact that I'm no longer a baby . You've got to get used to the idea . You were the gurglingest baby . Well , there you go again . Ah , I used to put you on my knee and bounce you up and down . Up and down . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings on . One shoe off and one shoe on , teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John . And you said , "" do it again , mommy , do it again , mommy . "" Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed ... I got tired on this knee , and I put you on this knee . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings ... you used to wear me out . Do it again , mother . You're joking . No , I'm not . Yes , you are . Oh , I can ... Well , that's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your father . - Oh , mother . - Oh , no . I don't understand . No , John . Not with me . It's me . You remember me ? Oh ... When it gets to the stage where you're making fun of a mother's love ... oh , no , mother . II ... I guess I'm just like all the other mothers . I can't take it . Making fun of my lullaby . Spoiling my memories . Oh , but I didn't mean it , mother . Oh , yes , you did . With all my heart , I didn't . Well , then don't ... don't act "" like the cur in the story . "" ? Don't bite the hand that's feeding you ? You're laughing . I made you ... well , you can still do that , can't you ? Well , if it takes my tears to make you laugh , that's all right , I don't care . Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fender . That's right . Did you come to laugh about it ? Well , no , I , uh , the , uh ... I was playing cowboy and Indians with the neighbor's child and trying to do my work at the same time . What do you want ? Oh , oh , well , it's about that , um , the ... the bent Fender , you know ? It came to a little more than I expected . It , uh , was , um , $18 ... don't choke over it . No , I'm not ... and 70 odd cents . I see , that's why you're here . Well , you know , after all , $18 is $18 . Oh , I know , I know , with taxes the way they are . Well , yes , you have to , uh , make a lot more than ... Well . Your attitude's a little different from what it was yesterday . Well , yesterday , I didn't ... well , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Well , I , uh ... Would pick a time when my husband wasn't here . What makes you presume that it was our fault ? Well , I think that's a rather natural presumption . Oh , yes , Sunday Christian , huh ? Well , I ... I mean , I'm just drivin ' along minding my business when , boom , it's a crash and I look back and then at you . Whose fault do you think that was ? Why didn't you look where you were going ? Look ? You hit me from behind . After all , I haven't got eyes in my rear . No ? Well , I ... I mean , I , you know , I can't ... I can't see what's in back of me . I thought that's what you meant . You meet some peculiar people nowadays . A lot of pettiness in the world , don't you think so ? Lady , there's nothing petty about $18 . It was the 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I don't think we hit anybody else yesterday . Hope you didn't have any trouble at the front door . Well , no , that , um , that was a present from my two sons . They're in the service . Yes , they were here last week . We had a sort of , um , farewell dinner . Well , I ... oh , but pardon me , you want to fight the battle of 18.70 , what is it ? It does seem a little silly to squabble about a repair bill when boys like yours are ... oh , you've got another side . Yeah . Maybe you 'd like to squabble over a cup of coffee . Yeah , I 'd like that . Come in . Bring the bill . I got it . That's what my boys sent me . Well , that's ... that's beautiful . I'm just dying to try it on . Why don't you ? I think I will . That's nice . Mmhmm . Madame butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as sad as poor butterfly . It's , uh , it's only that this was sent from San Francisco . That's a harbor , isn't it ? That's where ships sail from ? Yeah . Well , that was a welcome interruption . Yes ? Cleaner . Yes , it is . Where's Mrs . Jefferson ? Oh , she's , uh , on the phone . I'll take it . Yes ? No , he isn't here now . Who is calling , please ? Uh-huh . Wouldn't you think people would leave their names ? These are my two boys . The one's that , uh ... yeah . Look like a great pair of halfbacks . Yes . This one used to pass to that one . Yes , he 'd fade way back . Oh , yeah , to give him a chance to get down the field . Uhhuh . And then ... Boom , touchdown . You have two fine boys , all right . Oh , we have another son , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has more degrees than a thermometer . I said there was only one bright one in the family . He's brilliant though , really . He's going to give the commencement address at his university . Oh , that John Jefferson . Well , he is ... he's just famous , that's all . He doesn't know it , but his father and I are going to be there to hear him . Oh , that's wonderful . Well , I may be there myself . That's my Alma mater , too . - Oh ? - Mm-hmm . Well , uh , does ... he doesn't live here with you now then . No , he's just visiting . He's in Washington . That phone call , that was for him . Oh . That was long distance from Washington . He has a great career ahead of him . Well , it seems you have three fine sons , Mrs . Jefferson . Mmhmm . God was good to me . Oh , I don't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You're a wonderful mother . Is your mother still living ? I have a wonderful mother , too . Nothing petty about her . Oh , you shouldn't have done that . You never would have got it anyway . Mother ? Yes , John ? Hi . Oh , you said you 'd be home early . Have a good day ? Mm , fine . Well , my day was ... little lonely ? Oh , I'm sorry , mother . I promise that I'll see more of you . You do , John . You had a long distance phone call from Washington , D.C . Oh . Uh , who was it ? They didn't leave any name . What did he , um , did he leave any message ? It was a girl , John . You've got a girl , John ? Oh , no , mother , it was probably just a routine call from the office . No , it was a payphone . I heard her drop a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd call back later . Mmhmm . Where's father ? He's , uh , going over your notes . Oh . Well , I hope I was of some help on his speech . Well , uh , he didn't say ... John ? Father . How's your supper coming ? Oh , fine . Well , I'm sorry that I missed you this morning , father . Well , it was as much my fault as yours , son . I ate in haste , I had to leave . Well , uh , did you find my notes useful ? That's what I wanted to talk to you about , John . I hope you got my points , father , because I didn't want you to be saying things that you didn't mean . Now , you know , I realize as well as you that the legion is a great force for good and caution must be shown to avoid the danger of a misuse of their power . Well , don't you think fighting men can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , father . Well , then what happened to my first line ? We legionnaires must fight to keep the power in the people and if we let the state give us freedom , it also has the power to take it away . You , uh , you didn't find any substitute for that , you just , uh , marked that out with a blue pencil . Put your line back . Darn right I will . Put the wholespeech back , it's all right with me . That's what_i intend to do . I said , "" when the state denies God given rights and regards itself as a source of liberty , freedom is doomed . "" That isn't even your idea , is it ? No , I copied it . What difference does that make ? Copying it doesn't make it right . I copied it right . Just wait there . John . Oh , father , let's not go into it anymore . No , I've ... I've got another subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a talk . A good talk , away from your mother , and it's about you , son . Well , if you 'd enjoy it , father . Well , I don't know whether you will . As I told you , we're alert and we are alert . You just said that . Yes . And you sound to me like one of those guys that we should be alert about . One of those guys , father ? I just said that you sounded like one , I didn't say that you ... ' cause if I thought that you really were , you know , I 'd take you out in the backyard and I 'd give it to ya both barrels . No trial , huh ? Nah , you're off on the wrong slant . And you know what I'm talking about ' cause as your father , I wan na know where you're at it . Well , I can help you there . I'm headed for the bathroom . Wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'ll go with you . Yes ? Yes , it is . Yes , he's here now . Just a moment . Thanks , mom . Hello ? Yes . Uh , lu , I'm sorry , but I'm going on down to the legion now . Well , what about supper ? I'll eat something when I get home . Oh , but you must have a bite . Well , I'm not hungry . Oh , I'll hurry it up . Now , look , the meeting isn't till 8:00 . You have two whole hours . Well , it'll take me two hours to get my speech back the way it was . All right , see you later , son . Good luck , Dan . Thanks , I can use it . I can hear ya now . Yes . Yes . I heard you . I heard ... yes , goodbye . Oh , I ... I ... I know how you feel , mother . Do you ? I don't understand father's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . With a son like me ? You look worried , John . What , was it that phone call that did it ? Well , it was important , yes , mother , but , well , don't , uh , let's not go into how I look again . All right . I ... I made ... I made a cocktail in case anybody was in the mood . Good , let's keep it bright . I made enough for three , but ... you know , I ... I don't like to get back to father again , mother , but ... if you didn't , I would . He's so troubled , John . You know , when we left you off at the university ... Yes ? Well , um , he was so mad that you 'd rather talk to highbrow professors that he smashed right into another car . Oh , he did ? Was it father's fault ? Well , he claimed that the other fella stopped too fast . Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man came by here today with his bill , but I talked him out of it . He finally tore it up . Oh , he finally tore it up . Well , um , did you ... did you have to do a lot of talking ? Oh , I certainly did . He was downright ornery at first . Well , I turned him into a nice fella . You know , warmed him up with some coffee . Well , you two had quite a chat . Yes , we had quite a chat . I told him about Ben and Chuck , what great athl ... about this fellow , uh , did he ... I was talking about your brothers . You keep wanting to talk about this fella . What's the matter , John ? Does it bother you that I talk too much to strangers ? Oh , no ! It's just that , well , it does seem odd that the fellow would come all of this way merely to tear up his bill . Yes . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . Maybe . Now I'm bothered . I told him about you . He seemed very interested . You know me , John , when I get started about you . Oh , yes , mother . Did you , uh , did you start when I was a boy with a penny jar ? No . I did ... Quite a lot of talking though . Here it is , John . - Hm ? - Remember ? Yes . Oh , my pills , I forgot . What are they for , mother ? Modern science has pills for women of my age , John . For , uh , people who forget where they put ' em . They're supposed to insure us against going goofy . Goof insurance . Oh . I told Dr . carver that I 'd just as soon put my faith in God and what he intended . I 'd go along with science , too , mother , and take those little tablets . What about Moses and the tablets he left us ? With the prescription written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't need any pills . No . I always got my strength from two books , both very nourishing in their own way . The cookbook and the Bible . Remember how I used to trick you into learning this one with this one . I 'd say to you , "" I'll make you , um , cookies , pies , cakes , and jam , if you'll learn Matthew , mark , Luke , and John . "" We had a kind of a deal , remember ? Mmhmm . John , what is the matter with you ? Oh , mother , I've got more important things on my mind than cakes and cookies . And Luke and John . I , um , I've got to make a phone call , mother . Lehigh 2-4-1-1 , please . I'm sorry , mother . Um , what time is your next plane for New York ? Not until 12 ? Yeah , I know , but I've got to get there right away . I mean , I've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . I'm sorry to be popping in on you at this hour , but you heard my announcement about the clothing drive . Oh , my bundle isn't ready yet , father . Oh , I have a lot of things for you , especially now since Ben and Chuck are gone , but I have to go clear up in the attic to get them . Will tomorrow be all right ? Well , I suppose it'll have to be . I've been thinking about that joke that was told me Sunday . You know , the one about everybody helping me in this world and then trying to find me in the next . The joke has questionable merit and if John thinks what I ... he's on the phone . Oh , hello , John ! Hi , father . I'm doing a little work for the poor . John ? What ? I'm trying to help out a few people in this world , too . - Goodnight , father . - Goodnight . Well , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the car and ... well , then how much further is that from your field ? Damn . All right , yes . Bye . Come in . Mother ? All packed ? Yes . I wish I could leave with you feeling better . You could . I'm all right . I listened , John , when your father was saying some awful things to you . Oh , well , that's terrible , mother . No wonder you were so upset . I still am . Well , don't let father poison your thinking . I'm sure that I can clear this up in your mind . Do , John . Father is muddled , mother . He thinks in the past . The world at this point is in a turmoil and muddled thinking like father's certainly isn't going to help . Young thinkers are dreaming of the future , mother , what's ahead of us . Why not ? Go ahead . Our only hope is to learn to live with our fellow man . The globe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . We must tear down our spite fences and learn to live with our neighbors . That's good , John . Tear down our spite fences , love thy neighbor . Go on , I go along with you so far . Good . Now father thinks ... what do you think ? I love humanity , mother . I love the downtrodden , the helpless minorities . Good , John . That's what I tried to teach you . You know by heart that we must labor to help the weak , like Saint Paul said . No one can tell me that an early religious training doesn't show itself . Good . I know everything that you stand for , mother , and what I'm striving for is an intelligent and practical way to bring into existence a new and better ordered world . Wewe did understand each other , didn't we ? Yes . Remember how I pleaded for your education ? How they teased me that you were my favorite . You're part of me and it's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a part of you . I had dreams myself , John , of great things to be done . But a wife and mother doesn't have much time for more than put off till tomorrow . I ... I hoped , John , that ... You 'd see that someday my tomorrows would come through , some of them . We talk the same language and we think the same way . Of course we do . But , now , try to understand me . Everything that we agree on , you and I , I warn you , this is liberal thinking . So what ? If we think this way , we're leftists , communists , subversive . That's ridiculous . Well , of course it is , but that's the way father thinks . Oh , he doesn't mean that . Aw , I know , mother . Father's wonderful . And I 'd do anything to convince him that he's so wrong about me . Well , just tell him what you told me , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his head . I ... I want to prove once and for all how ridiculous his suspicions are . I 'd go to any lengths , mother , for your sake . I would swear on a stack of bibles . You would ? Well , it's just an expression . But so expressive . That'll do it . Oh , I'm beginning to feel better already . You know how religious your father is , wait till we tell him . Go ahead . Oh , mother . Go ahead . How does it go ? Oh , mother . I swear that I am not now or ever have been a member of the communist party . Feel better ? I can't wait for your father to come home . I'm a little relieved myself . You can't blame me now . Well , you really were worried , mother . Well , it alarmed me , you know ? You kept talking about this fellow with a silly bill . I thought it had something to do with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? I don't know . I mean , I didn't ... you mean my telephone conversation , my having to leave suddenly has got something to do with this man in the ... yes , yes , yes . Oh , mother , I'm ashamed of you . I'm ashamed . Well , you see , that just shows you what one remark like father's can do . Oh , I 'd hate to tell you what I was thinking . Your brain was racing , huh ? Was it . Well , now , you ... you get out of here . I'm going to get dressed and I'm going to get you something to eat . Oh , mother , no , I'm not hungry . Anyway , I should be calling my cab , you know ? Oh . Well , meeting broke up early ? No , no , I left early . What are you up to ? Well , I was just calling a cab , father . I have to leave suddenly . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , was it ? Did what I had to say in there cause you to ... oh , no , no , father . How was your speech ? Eh , you know that crowd . They , uh , they're not too bright . They applauded me . Where's your mother ? She'll be down in a minute . Will you and I have time to finish our talk ? It'll have to be brief , father , because my cab is on the way . Well , it can be . And if you won't remember where you were , I know where I was . It's your turn to talk , so think over what you're gon na say and I'll see how your mother is . Well , John , I ... Hm . Mm-hmm . Hm . This , uh , this is the Bible that your mother taught ... forgive me , son , if I look a little fuddled ... well , that's all right , father . Your mother just told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . She told me that she 'd heard us . Or heard you , father . Well , anyway , she believes in you . You've made her very happy , son , and I'm glad because I've tried to make things pleasant for her . Dr . carver , he told me ... father , try a little harder , will you ? Because you brought this on by leaping to the accusation ... no , I never accused you . Oh , yes , you did , father . No , I just said that you ... that you talk like a scummy . Uhhuh and mother heard it , so now she's upset . Well , anyway , I hope that this settles the whole thing . I mean , I can't do any more than swear on mother's Bible , so I hope that we can now forget everything that's happened , huh ? I hope so , yes . But , if you were , uh ... yes , father , go ahead . What ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a thing , would it , huh ? A whole stack of bibles . Well , there you go again . I know , I know . Father , open your mind and let this in , will you ? The church , they 'd believe me . The courts , they 'd believe me . Mother believes me , but you don't . Mmmm , not yet . Do you believe in the Bible ? Well , now , father , do you believe every page ? I mean Jonah and the whale ... I believe every page , son . Jonah and the whale ... even the pages you don't understand . I believe in those , too . That's faith . That certainly is , father . You mean you believe in heaven and hell's fire ... I sure as there's a hell do . Listen , son , take the first commandment . Do you believe in the lord thy God ? What about honoring your father and mother ? That's the fourth commandment . Well , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that one . Oh , father . What page was that on ? I don't know what page it's on . You made me do it . What have you done , Dan , what have you done ? You hit your son ! Well , he was just trying to pound some religion into me , mother . He tripped over the table . Will you get out of here ? Dan , will you get ... come on , come on , come on . Oh , please ... get on down to the legion . Now don't get yourself , lu , all excited . Put it on . Yes , mother , I'll put the coat on , but I wish you wouldn't get yourself ... and your hat , now , go on . Put the hat on . Maybe they've got some more beer left . There is . A whole barrel of it . So you're against me , too . Guess I'm just too dumb to get it . No , you're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . Hitting your own son . No , I didn't hit him , I just merely pushed him ... get out of here . ' Cause he's clumsy . Well , I'll have to go and change , mother ... I know you will ... I know ... wait a minute . Just let me ... let me sterilize it for you . Oh , mother , you don't have to . Put a band-aid on it or something . Oh , that's an ugly thing . Well , I told you that this would happen . I know you did , I know . I just can't talk to him . Well , there's my cab , mother . Here , I'll do it . Well , I've got ta change my pants anyway . And I've got ta catch the plane before midnight . Call a cab ? Yes , be there in a minute . I'll get it , mother . Hello ? Ben ! Well , how are you ? Where are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down to pay a visit to mother and dad . Chuck , how are ya ? Hiya , boy . You keep up the fight in the home front , won't ya , John ? Yes , yeah , I'll be in there punching . Well , good luck to both of you . And I'll put somebody on so you can get your money's worth . Hello , Chuck . You in San Francisco ? I got the kimono , it's wonderful . I was a little disappointed though , no opium pipe . She got the kimono . Hi , mom . Hello , Ben . Chuck says you may be leaving soon . I hope you're on a slow boat . Goodbye , boys . Goodbye , mom ! Byebye . They're leaving , John . I won't hear those voices again for a long time . Well , mother , maybe we'll have a lasting peace one day soon . Oh , you fight for that , John , in your way , and say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light two candles for them , I'll light one for you , too . Good . Bye . Now , don't forget you're my tomorrows , John . What's the matter , dear ? Goodbye . Oh , your knee . Oh , it's all right . Soso many things on my mind . What are you gon na do about the trousers ? Oh , they're ruined . Throw them away . Give them to father o'dowd . Goodbye . And you drive carefully now . - So long ! - Or I'll school you ! Good morning . Good morning . I'll fix that . You look like you finished the barrel . People who aren't so bright can hold a lot . Dan , I blew up . I'm sorry I threw you out of the house . That is a commie specialty . - What ? - Breaking up homes . I may not be bright , but I know that . I'll have to talk to you in the morning . John stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but he loves humanity , Dan . He may love humanity , but he's not for his old man . I'm a human being , I'm human . No crying , jagna . Can't stand anybody that looks into the future . You can't even stand . I'm all right . John explained it all so clearly , Dan . You're suspicious of anybody that has liberal views . Saint Paul was a liberal ... leave Saint Paul out of this . You leave the lamp alone . Listen . Let's just stick to John's kind of liberalism , hm ? They just caught one of his kind down in Washington . But you don't mean for a minute to infer ... she knows a lot of people that talk just like our son John . That's the beer talking . No , it isn't . I switched to bourbon . You're in fine shape to teach little children in the morning . I'm not teaching little children in the morning . I'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s the use of teaching honesty , goodness , love of home and country ? Hm ? Nobody gives a hang . Oh , some mothers are very interested in report cards . Good grades , not character , high marks . Fathers , they just don't care . I take that back . One father did come to the school . He wanted me fired . He heard that I had mentioned God in the classroom . His little son of a ... father like that snitched on me . I must teach his little stool pigeon reading , writing , and ' rithmetic . Just suppose that he gets excellent in the three r's and he gets a goose egg for character . Reading , excellent . But if he reads nothing about his faith , whatever it might be , his head will be as empty as ... as John thinks mine is . Take writing . There's a lot of good writing on bad checks . Forgers have excellent penmanship . Am I boring you ? Oh , go to bed , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit your son . I'll tell you now and then I'll go to bed . I saw red when he said that i made it difficult for him to honor his father and his mother . It's wrong . He honors his mother . And so do I . I honor you , lu . But he makes fun of ... oh . I'm sorry . It's all right . But he makes fun of his father . You saw how he acted when I sang my song . ? If you don't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back ... ? ? Now who's breaking up our home ? If I broke anything , I'll fix it . I just wanted to show you how silly your son behaves . Where does he get his awkwardness ? You know , I've been thinking . I'm not going to quit . I'm going back to school in the morning and keep on teaching little children . Hello ? Yes . Yes . Hello , John . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s too bad your father isn't here so you could talk to him . Well , John , I know how busy you are and this is expensive , but believe me it was worth it , dear . And I hope that your day is as bright as you've made mine . Goodbye . What ? Oh . Your trousers ? Those old things ? Well , I gave them to father o'dowd like you told me to . Why ? Did you leave anything in them ? John , you seem upset . Is that why you called ? All right . All right , I'll get them . I w ... I will . I'll get them this evening . Right away . All right . Your father has the car , but I'll walk over . All right . Well , it was good to get to talk to you , John . Goodbye . What is the reason for this visit , Mr . ? You didn't tell me your name before . Suppose you start right off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jefferson . Federal bureau of investigation . Mm-hmm . No , I won't , uh , take your hat . I have a feeling that you're not going to stay long . Would you mind if I sit down ? I don't care . I'm aware this is a shock to you and I ... I don't want to frighten you . I'm not at all frightened , Mr . stedman . I seem to ... to startle you . Naturally . When you showed me who you are . No , no , even before that . I ... I thought that you looked , uh , you looked more shocked when you saw me than when you found out who I am . Well , suppose you say why you're here and I'll try to have the right expression . It's about John . What's he d ... what do you think he's done ? I'm not sure that he's done anything . Well , you won't be any more sure by talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you anything anyway . Well , you're within your rights to refuse . Were you within your rights when you wormed your way ... that's right , you wormed your way , into my confidence so I 'd do a lot of talking . I know that ... that our methods are very often criticized by certain sources because we're after them day and night . But nobody objects to a firm that protects its business by investigating your credit . Insurance outfits have to protect themselves by thorough investigations . Well , I ... I've always had great respect for you people , up to now . Do you ... you care to answer any questions ? Or not ? Like , for instance ? I 'd like to know why John left suddenly . Well , I know why . He had a perfectly good reason for leaving suddenly . But I see no reason why I should tell you . I know this , though , I'm leaving suddenly . I have a lot of things to do . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things i have to do . You can stay around though , it's all right . Look the house over . Oh , you'll find my beds aren't made . I haven't done my housework yet , thanks to you . Oh . There you are , father . Oh , hello , there ! Did you come over to help us ? I want you to see this . Now there's something that anybody could use . Mrs . mooney gave me that . Oh , the woman has a heart of gold . Father , I want something back . You Indian giver . Well , you know those trousers I gave you ? They're John's and he wants them back . Then he's the Indian giver . Perhaps he left something in them . No , I , uh , I asked him that and he said no . They seem worthless to me . Well , we'll find them if they're here . Here's some of my stuff . Would you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... they were gray . - Gray . - Flannel . Flannel . They had a little stripe in them , I think . Gray flannel with a little stripe in them . There's gray flannel with a little stripe in them , but , uh , that's a coat . Is there any other kind of a hint that you could give me or a clue ? Yes , there is . Here they are . Well , they're not much , are they ? Well , to me , those trousers are a complete ruin . That's what I tried to tell him . How in the world did he ever do that ? Hehe ... he sort of tripped . He had a nasty fall . Well , I don't care who his tailor is , he'll never fix that up so they look like their Sunday best . Well , they're good material though , you know ? Oh , yes , they are good mat ... oh , he could fix it , he could . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . I'll tell you what you could do . You could cut them off right there . Make short pants of them . Oh , I noticed Sunday when I talked to John , he's changed considerable since he wore short pants . But I've always said he was the best altar boy I've ever had . He not only served the mass , but he had sort of a , well , a nuance . He looked good doing it , like a notre dame quarterback . And on the other hand , you'll take Chuck and Ben . When they served the mass ... now look at ya . The minute I mention Chuck and Ben . Goodbye , father . Goodbye . Will you do that ? Excuse me just a moment . Arbie's ? Just a moment . Telephone . Yeah ? She got in , huh ? It looks like it . Well , she'll either come to see me or go to that other place . Yeah , well , there's a nice view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol over here . And , uh , down through here there's a little park that , um ... Oh , you're tired , mother . Why don't you sit down ? Now , tell me , how did you get here ? I flew . No ! How did you get up enough nerve to get on a plane ? Oh , I haven't . You seemed so anxious to have these in a hurry . Oh , but you didn't have to ... well ? Oh , mother , you could've mailed them . I mean , I merely wanted ... the trousers , yeah . Not particularly glad to see me , just glad to see the trousers , huh ? Oh , mother , the trousers . I'm tickled to see you . I'm just ... well , I'm just surprised that you 'd fly all the way down here . Yeah . Well , things work out for the best , don't they ? Here I made such a fuss over these trousers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . You know , when you told me that you had to walk all that way it worried me and I called you back to tell you to take a cab on me , but there wasn't any answer . Oh , I was gone , I ... But there was somebody there . He ... no , I guess maybe he was gone , too . Who ? That man you're not worried about . He came back . As long as you're not worried about him , his name is stedman . He came back . Well , then you brought these trousers down just so you could talk about him , hm ? You know , I've been thinking about him . He could have been with the FBI , you know , on one of those routine loyalty checks . We shouldn't resent it . I mean , after all , it's their duty to investigate and protect us . And they're having to work overtime these days , you know , I mean , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see what you mean , mother . My gosh . But it's amazing , you know , what our weavers can ... Um . Mother , what was that man's name again ? You mean stedman , don't you ? Can't I help you anymore ? Don't deceive me , John . If there's anything wrong , if you just tell me , you know , then maybe I could help . What are you looking for ? Is it a key ? Well , I thought maybe that there was a key in my trousers , mother , and I thought maybe that you might have it . It's the key to my apartment . But , darling , it's of no importance . John , darling , is it of no importance ? Mother , it's of no importance whatsoever . I mean , I lose it so many times . You know , I hate to keep asking the landlady for another . Do you have it ? Yes , I do , I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you back . No . It was to take a cab . Mmhmm . But I also wanted to tell you about the key , too . I feel faint . I'm sick . Oh , mother . I hate to rush you , John , but without you , the committee's just sitting there . Mother , now I'm in the middle of a big conference right now , but I'll break that up and take the rest of the day off , hm ? No , it can't be . Thought that was you and then I said to myself , "" now what in the world can she be doing in Washington ? "" Well , I still say what are you doing in Washington ? Came down to see my son . Please don't ask a lot of things you know already . May I ask if you're going back to see him again ? Yes , I am . He's just going to be busy for the next hour and a half . And I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you have some time on your hands , you certainly picked out a nice spot here . I guess you know that's Jefferson's memorial over there . He called this liberty of ours a gift of God . The words are inscribed on the memorial . That's the Washington monument and , um , the Lincoln memorial . No , you can't see that from here . That's just over there beyond those trees . And then , uh , beyond that across the river is Arlington cemetery . That's famous for those who gave their lives for us . Well , how are those two fighting halfbacks of yours ? Have you heard from them ? They sailed . Now we have to fight on the home front for those two . They're fighting for everything these dead held dear and the living should . Whatwhat are you trying to do ? Fire up my patriotism ? II just want you to appreciate that everything I've done on this case I've done to preserve the things that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson . Do you think my boy is mixed up in this ? Oh , if you thought for one moment . Oh , he couldn't possibly . Did , um , did John ever get any phone calls when he was down at the house ? Yes , he ... you were there . We have this miss carlin down here in the district jail . I think it might be a good idea if you listen to her voice and , you see , you have plenty of time . I have my car up here . I warn you , it wasn't a very good connection . I remember that . So I picked her up after she left you . I felt sorry for her . Had to have our little joke . Couldn't say she was glad to meet me . Hoped she would never see me again . She wanted to make sure that you weren't going to follow her . She'll turn here in a minute . Mm-hmm . She watched you go around the corner . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chances of being followed . Smitty picked her up here in his car . Then carlin's apartment is over here on the left , huh ? That's right . We , uh , we had two hidden cameras outside Ruth's apartment up here . Mmhmm . See , one was hung from the fire escape and we picked her up coming in the hall . Yeah . Look at that . Look at her hand shake . I don't blame her . Mine would , too . She knows now . She had all of her chips on this one son . Got a real problem on her hands now . I picked her up here later in the park , sitting on that bench . The beating she's taken . I'm gon na have to ask her questions . She being a truthful woman , every answer is going to incriminate her son . It's gon na be quite a test . God and country or her son , John . She's headed for the airport now and home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lu ? Lucille ? Hey , lu . What's the matter ? What have you been up to ? What's happened ? I flew to Washington , Dan . To see John . You flew to ... Well , I thought we were going to fly together to see him . You beat me to it . You went to apologize for me , huh ? Maybe you're just a little air sick , dear . I am a little sick , Dan . I had to see John . I'm sorry , lu . About everything . I brought this all on by hitting my own son . Hitting him was just like hitting you , wasn't it , dear ? How could a man be so dumb ? No , you're not , Dan . Look , I know , I'm just not very bright . You never said it truer . You are the brightest and dearest . You've got more wisdom than all of us because you listen to your heart . You're not blinded by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest and clean . Now don't overdo it , lu . See , when you talk like that , you're the one that's not thinking so straight . It's not your fault , Dan . Yes , it is . Lu . Lu , I've been suffering all day long . I'm gon na tell John tomorrow how wrong I was . I'm speaking honestly from my heart . What's the matter , lu ? Would you call Dr . carver , huh ? What is the matter , dear ? I feel ... I don't know . I feel I want Dr . carver , Dan . Well , here . Lie down . We'll cover you up . You know , we'll get Dr . carver . Oh , oh , well , they have no phone , have they ? No , I know , I know . Lu , the doctor's over at the rebners ' . Now , I'll go get him . It shouldn't take very long . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you avoided your father . I came here to find out about you . Why did you leave the office ? We'll get around to that . Oh , mother , you had me worried sick . Yes , mm-hmm . Did you tell father about your little trip ? I didn't tell him all about it . If I had , it would kill him . Or he 'd kill you . He ... I've sent him for the doctor . What would kill him , mother ? I mean , I don't follow . I don't understand . If he knew that the FBI is after you , John . Mother , I thought I explained to you all about the FBI . Now , no more fancy lies , John . You'll spend your tomorrows in a federal prison unless you can explain the key to that carlin girl's apartment . Well , now , what makes you think that I ... because it fits . It opens the door . You mean you went to her apartment ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother , are you out of your mind ? Not yet . You lied to me so much , John , that I had to know the truth . Do I know it now ? Are you guilty , John ? Mother , I'm guilty to this extent . Now , wait just a minute . You see , darling , Ruth carlin and I were intimate , quite intimate . And naturally , I hesitated telling you . Only one ... one sin in the constitution and that ... and that's treason . I don't know what's happened to my morals for the moment , but is ... is that all ? Is that all you have done ? That's all , mother . That's bad . But it's good . That's right . But who would believe it , mother ? Besides you and me . Mr . stedman would believe it . He 'd understand . We could get him on the phone . Well , no , mother , that isn't necessary , dear . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret just between us . But we have to tell Mr . stedman , Johnny , he won't let it go any further . Oh , I'll be so happy to tell him . Mother , have you seen him again ? Yes , he came up to me in the park and he took me to see her . To see ... But I ... I didn't recognize her voice , John . He took you down to the jail ? Well , that's why we can't tell him , mother . I mean , he ... It's his job to persecute innocent people . No , he 'd believe us , John . Un ... unless you're lying again . You are lying . Look at you . You are guilty . Mother , darling . "" Mother , darling . "" Listen to you ! Pleading for love , mercy , all the things you've scoffed at . Now you're asking for mother love . Confess to the FBI , John . You've given up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyway . I'll reach my own decisions , mother . You have to make one big one right now , John . Mother , if you will stand by me , I know that I can show you the light . After I make my speech to the graduating class ... after you what ? Oh , no , you're not . Just because my son has been poisoned , I'll ... I'll not let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . Are you planning to make them over to your pattern ? Made in your image and likeness ? God , help him . Look , before father gets back , please give me the key . The key ? Yes , the key , the key to your freedom . So you'll be free to go on making other young people as wretched as you are . Spreading despair . Oh , disguised as hope . Well , now , uh , mother ? How do you plan to stop me ? I'll tell all I know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I haven't lost all faith in you . There are issues in the world today , mother , that transcend a mother and son . Yes , there are things that are far greater than you and me and we have to face them , not as mother and son , but as individuals . The cord is severed . All right . So , as an individual , I believe in human dignity , truth . Wow , you certainly aren't talking as a mother now . But you're ill , dear . You're talking insanely . Am I ? Within your state of mind , dear , no one would believe what you're saying . And I 'd be forced to agree with them . A woman in your time of life , dear , under a doctor's care , two boys in uniform , a husband , my father , inflaming you with patriotic fanaticism about spies and traitors . John , you couldn't . Do ... do you mean that ... You might perhaps have me put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I want to give him the key . Dan , I can't fight much longer . Is it in your purse ? No , it isn't . What are you going to do , John ? Use force and violence on your mother ? Someday , mother , you'll understand how big our fight is . I do now , I do now . No , you don't . There are millions on my side . Millions on my side . And what a fight you have on your hands . Wait a minute , mother . Don't say a word about this . Why not ? Dan , Dan . Hello , Mrs . Jefferson . Come in , Mr . stedman . This is my son , John . Well , I'm sorry , Mr . stedman , you couldn't have come at a worse time . My mother is very ill . Well , I'm sorry to hear that . But my father will be here any minute with the doctor , but we're terribly worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imagining all sorts of things . No . He came at a good time . He came at a good time . Come in , Mr . stedman . You , too , John . Go ahead . You start it , Mr . stedman . I would like to ask a few questions . Yes , indeed , I am ... and that is if your mother's condition will permit . Well , obviously , it doesn't , I 'd like to ask you a few questions myself first . We gather information , we don't give it up . Mr . stedman , you know that it's within our rights to ask you to leave this house immediately . No , John , this is my house . It has a mortgage on it . You know that , John . We always thought it was such a wonderful mortgage . Maybe , uh , the bank will , uh , come and throw us all out . I 'd like to get rid of this house . It's old fashioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that should give you an idea of my mother's condition . Mrs . Jefferson , I would like to ask you , where did you go after you left ? Oh . You . You take over whenever you want to . Uh , so , after you left me , I ... Could I tell this in my own way ? Certainly . I'll get back to your , um ... All right . I went to a church because I was a confused stranger down there . And a ... a church is , um , a traveler's aide to people who don't , uh , know which way to turn . That would straighten out a lot of people . Oh , yeah . They ... they should try the church . Then they 'd begin to remember things that they've , uh , lost , like honor . My sacred word of honor . Tell people . Tell them about their sacred word of honor . I'll tell them . Mother will be to drum next , singing "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don't talk like that about your mother . There's nothing petty about your mother , is there ? No . You be nice to her , you promise . Promise . I promise . Those ... two two boys of yours , those two halfbacks , they're gon na be marching soon , aren't they ? Yes . They'll sing with us . ? He died to make men holy ? ? They may die to make men free . There they are , yeah . They called me from San Francisco . What fight they had . Do you remember , John , hm ? Yes , dear . Many is the game they pulled out of the fire when time was running out . When time was running out , John . Yes . You never played , did you ? No , dear . I think sometimes it hurt you when your father and I jumped up and down cheering for them . Which you remember that I whispered to you , "" keep on studying , there are other goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ben and Chuck again . They're fighting on God's side now and I'm fighting with ' em . The doctor will be here any minute , darling . You listen to me , John , you've got to get in this game and you've got carry the ball yourself . Well , you're doing all right ... I'm carrying it now , but I want to pass it to you , hm ? Take the ball , John . I ... I don't want to make this last play . John , time's running out . We can't stop that clock . John , take the ball before the clock runs out , John . I'm ... I'm ... I'm cheering for you now . My son John , my son John , my son John ... mother , why don't you go upstairs and lie down , darling ? There's the gun . We lost . That was a tough one to lose . Mother . Mother ? Take him away , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be punished , John . You look a little sick . I ... I used to spank your little bottom , but you're big now . You're big . Mother , darling , will you listen ? Your conscience must be nauseated . The lower you sink , the higher you rise in your party , don't you , John ? Come on , doc . Go on in , doc , she's right upstairs in the bedroom . You know where it is . No , she's , uh , she's right in there . Oh , thank you . What are you doing here ? Now wait just a minute , Mr . Jefferson . A lot's gone on since you left . About John ? Is that Dan ? She's taken an awful beating . Yeah ? I was just saying that we ought to sell this place . Yes , yes , dear . Get rid of it because , uh , it's too much . Right , now just ... just be quiet . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness is in a pretty bad way . Testimony may never be any good now . Well , for the moment , it looks like our case is shut . I'll be in as soon as I can . Right on . Now , try to get a grip on yourself , Dan . How can I with a traitor for a son ? He said he couldn't prove that . How did he happen to let him get away ? He said he couldn't hold him without Lucille . And we won't know about her ... he got out of here before I killed him . Shh , please . I'm trying to get her to sleep . How is she ? She's not going to lose her mind . My own flesh and blood . Doc , doc , you've known me for a long time , haven't you ? Sure , sure . I never , never in my life have I done anything to ... I know , Dan , I know . And she ... And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan ? Let's pray for John . All right , dear . Our father who art in heaven , hallowed be they name , thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , on earth as it is heaven . Give us this day our daily bread and for ... forgive us ... Attention , please . Flight 92 for Lisbon now boarding at the concourse gate number 20 . All aboard flight 92 , please . Hello . Yeah . John ? I understand you're on your way to Lisbon . Huh ? Well , what happened ? Not going . Passenger John Jefferson , the plane for Lisbon is leaving immediately from gate number 20 . What time to make a big decision . Well , do you want to come over here and let me help you make it ? By yourself . Well , John , I don't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Well , uh ... No , we don't make deals . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Judas . Passenger Jefferson , this is the final call . John , does anyone else know you're not going to Lisbon ? Now listen , John , use whatever free will you have left to make your own decision and get over here . All right . All right . What is the deal ? Well ... Do we make out a warrant ? Maybe . Maybe we do . Why , John , what an honor ! Oh , I 'd give my life to make you truthful . I'm cheering for you this time , John . I'm ... I'm ... I'm cheering for you now . Go on , rise to it . You can do it . I mean , everybody has some purpose in life , even Judas . John , I don't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Just because my son has been poisoned I'm not going to let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and break their parents ' hearts . You're not going to tell those young Americans to use their God given liberty to destroy liberty .

Some people would rather he didn't , I imagine . Yeah . Hello ? Yes , John . You finished your commencement address and you want me to hear it ? Well , John , look , I warned you about us making any kind of deals bec ... John . John ! Yes , and someone else can hear you , too . John , get out of there as fast as you can . Take Pennsylvania Avenue . Is there someone that 'd rather you didn't get there ? I think we're being followed . We'll soon find out . Hold on , mister . Well , at least the driver wasn't hurt . Hey , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Mr . stedman . They got me . Yeah , I know who . Try not to move , John , the ambulance will be here in a minute . I'm sorry . I wanted to make a speech to the graduating class . Where is it , John ? Do you have it ? I haven't got it . It's in my office . I made a recording . A recording . I'll get it . I'll get right over there . If I think the students should hear it , they'll hear it . I might add that , um , he was to have been given the honorary degree of doctor of laws this day . So the , um , speech was found in his office by the federal bureau of investigation . You will now hear it verbatim as recorded by John Jefferson , class of 1941 . Members of the graduating class and their fathers and mothers . I mention your parents because I address you as representing their tomorrows . Sometimes this day is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , it will be both , but my life will be altogether different from yours . By now , a plane has arrived in Lisbon . It would have carried me far beyond the laws of my native land , but no plane , no means of transportation , nothing can take a man away from himself . He lives with himself day and night . His conscience lives with him , its voice will not be stilled . Mine warned me that I would not be free in Lisbon , that I would only find my freedom here . So here I stand . Hardly believing that but a few years back i sat down there in my cap and gown , like all of you . I looked like you then . I felt like you feel today , ready to go forward , full of zeal , full of purpose . I was going to help make a better world . I was flattered when I was immediately recognized as an intellect . I was invited to homes where only superior minds communed . It excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't have dreamed of when I lived at home . A bold defiance of the only authorities my church , and my mother and father . I know that many of you have experienced that stimulation . But stimulants lead to narcotics . As the cellar of habit forming dope gives the innocent their first inoculations with a cunning worthy of a serpent . There are other snakes lying in wait to satisfy the desire of the young to dedicate themselves to something positive , to give their existence purpose . And the lure is to every young American's sense of justice , their love of fair play that makes all decent men rebel against the evil forces that exploit the weak . With the purest and noblest motives , we eagerly embrace an organized , definite , and active movement to alleviate the suffering all around us . Our beautiful liberalism is now aroused and we have faith in ourselves , our comrades . Somewhere along the line , our brain has been numbed so that we have substituted faith in man for faith in God . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . They have observed your abilities and seen qualities that I once possessed . It's too late to save me . It is not too late for you to save yourselves . No one warned me as solemnly as I am warning you now . Hold fast to honor , it's sacred . No one tried to live the part they wrote for me more than I did . But living it with no spiritual compass , i lost all sense of direction . Any means justified their ends . Shameless falsehood , self-abasement , treachery . And before I realized the enormity of the steps i had taken , i was an enemy of my country and the servant of a foreign power . Now you know that the honor conferred upon me in this citation is false . Every word in it is a lie because I am a living lie . I am a traitor . I am a native American communist spy . And may God have mercy on my soul . There is another paper waiting for me , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my proper degree and this is also my commencement day , the beginning of a new life , so help me , God . There's their chapel . Uhhuh . Let's pray for John , hm ? There was a lot of good in what he said . Some of those ... yes , let's hope they forget what he did . And pray they remember what he said today . Yes .

One time slot in case The Honorable Minister for Education Decides to show up this year . Brent , I suppose you propose The city versus country football match ? Absolutely .

What ? What ? Oh , it's good . It's good . It's really , it's great . What were you going to say ? Ah , nothing . But just that , um , Didn't you say that your students were Aboriginal ?

How would you guys like to perform at NAIDOC week ? Are you serious ? CHALMERS : Mm-hmm . Do you think we'll be good enough , Miss ? Well , it's going to take a lot of work . And we're really going to have to trust each other , So it's your call . I'm willing to put in the work . What do you think ? You want to do this ? ALL : Yeah . Is it a custom ? Ay , marry , isn't , But to my mind , though I am native here . To the manor born it is a custom . Suit the action to the word , the word ... CHALMERS : All right , take five . So who can tell me what subtext is ? Dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It's the most important question A performer has to ask themselves . What do these words really mean ? What is this character really trying to say ? For example , what if I walk into the room And I say , "" Good morning , class "" ? The subtext determines how I say good morning . So what if I say , ( Glumly ) "" Good morning , class . "" What do I mean ? You're sick ? Right , or I don't want to be here . What if I say , "" Good morning , class ! "" What's my subtext ? You've dropped an E ? That's right , Joseph , Or I'm trying to inspire you guys . We use subtext all the time . The same with artists and musicians .

In fact , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , really . Think about it . He used poetry , Rhyming couplets to express himself . His rhymes were a social commentary , Just like Shakespeare's .

"" Okay , Liam , read the last two lines of the scene we just did . Sit still my soul . Foul deeds will rise . All the earth overwhelm them to man's eyes . CHALMERS : Drew ? When my mama ask me , will I change , I tell her yeah , But it's clear I'll always be the same until the end of time . * So take , these broken wings * * I need your hands to come and heal me once again * You Steve ?

( @bell_ringing ) There's a full read-through tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey . Are you doing anything this afternoon ? Uh , no . Why ? Got a read-through tomorrow . Just wondering if , I don't know , we could go over some stuff ? Fortinbrass has my dying voice . So tell him , with the occurrents more and less . Which have solicited , The rest is silence . Now cracks a noble heart . Good night , sweet prince . And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest . What happens now ? You're dead . You know your lines all right . You're a freak . It's weird , eh , how much you remember from when you're little . What do you mean ? Oh , I used to listen to my uncle reads his lines Over and over when he did Hamlet . They rehearsed just across the water . All that for his dad , hey ? Oh , he didn't have much choice , but . What do you mean ? You know , duty and stuff . Don't know if I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What ? Dying for him ? It's not like it's going to bring him back . Besides , he wouldn't want me to . How do you know ? Because I know he loves me . I found out where Barry Griffen's living . Yeah ? Eastern suburbs . I'm gon na pay him a little visit , and I need you there . There's talk of another riot coming up . That's our chance . While the cops have their hands full here ... Bang . What about Dad ? This is for Dad , you dickhead . Dad and Uncle Charlie . We got ta show ' em ... we're still in charge . Then what do you need me for ? To drive . You won't even be in the house . I don't have a license . We're gon na go shoot this fucker , And you're worried about not having a license ? Jase might come too , But I don't what no one else knowing nothing ' , okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license . You got a black_fella's license , don't ya ? Take up the bodies . Such a sight as this becomes the field , But here shows much amiss . Go , bid the soldiers shoot . Okay , what do we think of the end of the play ? CASEY : It sucks . It totally sucks , but that's what makes it a tragedy . And what about Hamlet's state of mind ? Do you guys think he was really mad , or insane ? He ... he pretends to be mad so no one suspects him . Maybe . Or maybe so he doesn't have to take action at all . Wasn't it only when Laertes wanted to fight Hamlet That he was forced to respond ? Liam ? In Act 3 , the King says , "" Madness in great one's should not unwatched go . "" What does he mean by this ? There's a reason for him being mad . And the king knows it . That's why Shakespeare has lasted all these years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a deadly MC , Miss . Open to interpretation . CHALMERS : That's exactly right . Or any great work of art . It's through art that we can escape , That we can experience a sense of freedom . People use art to try to effect change . Shakespeare used the theater To express his view on Morality , beauty , politics . Other artists use music , Photography , painting , Even movies . Okay , today , I want each of you to write a letter To someone important in your life , A special guest that you 'd like to invite To come and see our play , okay ? It can be anyone , sports star , a politician , your mom , dad . I'm going to write to the Minister for Education as my special guest .

Stay right here by the car . And don't tell everyone my business . Mr . Werthan ? Yes , sir , it's me ! Guess where I'm at . I just drove your mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , but she's all right . She's in the store . Oh , Lord , she just looked out the window and seen me . She'll probably throw a fit right there at the check-out counter . Yes , sir . You are right about that . It only took me 6 days . Same time it took the Lord to make the world . Yes , sir . All right . ' Bye . Hey Oscar , Junior . How you old boys doing today ? How the lady been treating you ? I'll tell you one thing ; she knows how to throw a fit . What's so funny ? Nothing , Miss Daisy . We just carrying on . Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning here for 15 years . Never carried on before ! Leave them alone . Put your coat on . We're late . Idella , I'm gone now . I'm right behind her . Hear , oh Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one . Such a nice man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I can get it myself ! Hurry out of here ! Is something wrong , Miss Daisy ? Something I done ? Yes . I haven't done anything . You parked the car right in front of the temple , like I was the Queen of Romania . Everybody saw you ! I said to wait for me in back . Yes , Ma'am , but I was just trying to ... There were two chauffeurs right behind me . You made me look like a fool . A g.d . fool ! Oh , Miss Daisy , Lord knows you ain't no fool ! Slow down ! Miriam and Beulah , I could see what they were thinking when we came out . What's that ? That I was pretending to be rich ! - You is rich . - No , I'm not ! Nobody can say I put on airs . On Forsyth Street we made many meals of grits and gravy . I have done without plenty of times . Miss Daisy , if I was to ever get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around for everyone in the world to see . That's vulgar ! Don't talk to me ! Never understand some white folks . What was that ? ! I heard that ! Now , Miss Daisy ... you needs a chauffeur and Lord knows I need a job . So why don't we just leave it at that ? Good morning , Mama . What's the matter ? No , I don't always think something's wrong when you call . Just when you call so early . What ? ! All right . I'll be there as soon as I can . I better get on over there . ' Bye . Come on . It's not healthy to rush like this . I eat too much , anyway . Besides , it sounds like she needs me . When doesn't it ? Give Mother Werthan my love . Coffee , Katie Bell ! I didn't expect to find you in one piece . I wanted you to be here when he comes . I wanted you to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s stealing from me . Hoke ? Are you sure ? I don't make empty accusations . I have proof ! This ! I found it hidden in the garbage under some coffee grounds . - He stole a can of salmon ? - Here it is ! I knew there was something funny . They all take things , you know . So I counted . The silverware first . Then the linen napkins . And then I went into the pantry . And the first thing that caught my eye was a hole behind the lima beans . And I knew right away . There are only 8 cans of salmon . I had 9 ! 3 for $1 on sale . Very clever , Mama . I missed my breakfast and I'm late to a meeting for a 33c can of salmon ? You want 33c ? Here's $1 ! Here's $10 ! Buy yourself a pantry full of salmon ! Why , Boolie , the idea ! Waving money at me like that ! I don't want money . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it was mine ! I leave him plenty of food every day . I tell him exactly what it is . Like children . If they want something , they just take it ! He'll never admit this . "" No , "" he'll say , "" I don't know nothing about that ! "" I don't like it ! I don't like living with no privacy . Go ahead , defend him . You always do ! I give up ! You want to drive again , arrange your own insurance . Take the trolley . Buy yourself a taxicab ! Anything you want ! Just leave me out of it ! Why , Boolie ! What's he doing here this time of morning ? Can't be good , I promise you that ! I think it's fixing to clear up out there ! Excuse me , Mr . Werthan . Y'all busy ? We have to have a little talk , Hoke . All right , just let me get out of my coat . Yesterday , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon . Now I know you said to eat the leftover pork chops . Well , they were kind of stiff . So , I stopped by the Piggly Wiggly and got you another can . Do you want me to put it on the shelf ? Yes , thank you , Hoke . Be right with you , Mr . Werthan . Well , I got to get dressed now . Good-bye , son . You know , Miss Daisy , I was just thinking . We been out to this cemetery 3 times this month already . It ain't even the 20th yet . It's good to come in nice weather . Yes , ma'am . You sure right about that . Sure is . Mr . Sig's grave is mighty well tended . I think you're the best widow in the State of Georgia . Boolie's always pestering me to have the staff here tend to this plot . "" Perpetual care , "" they call it . Well , don't you do it ! It's right to have member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that ! Boolie will have me in perpetual care before I'm cold . Miss Daisy , you ought to go on away from here ! Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave . Leo Bauer . Is that Miss Rose Bauer's husband ? She asked me to bring it out here . Where is his grave at , Miss Daisy ? I'm not exactly sure . I know it's two rows over that way . You'll see the headstone , "" Bauer . "" What's wrong ? Nothing wrong . Nothing the matter at all . Now , you say ... I told you it's two rows over that way . It says "" Bauer "" on the headstone . What that look like ? What are you talking about ? I'm talking about I can't read , ma'am . What ? ! I can't read , Miss Daisy . You look at the paper all the time . Well , that's just it . I just be looking ! I try to dope out what's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , ma'am . I know my ABC's . I just can't read . Stop saying that ! You're making me mad ! If you know letters , then you can read . You just don't know you can read . I taught some of the stupidest children God ever put on this earth . And they all could read enough to find a name on a tombstone . The name is "" Bauer . "" "" Bauer ! "" What does that "" buh "" letter sound like ? - B ? - Of course ! "" Er . "" That is the last part . "" Bauer ! "" What letter sounds like "" er "" ? R ! - So the first letter is ... - B ! And the last letter ? R ! B-R . Brr . It even sounds like Bauer , doesn't it ? It sure do , Miss Daisy ! It sure do ! - That it ? - That's it . - What about the middle ? - Not right now . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . R at the end . B ... R . That's it . That's all right ! I sure do appreciate this ! Don't be ridiculous ! Let's get all this back in the car . I'm burning up . Of course I told you ! Of course I told you ! How can I be expected to buy it if you don't write it down ? ! I'm sorry , Miss Florine . I need you . I'll be right there . Do you have any idea what it takes to give a Christmas reception ? It takes an eye for detail . I told you a million times , Katie Bell , write it down ! More I can not do ! We are out of coconut . I'm sure we can manage . - I told her . - You didn't write it down ! I don't need to stand and listen to excuses on Christmas . You figure out how to serve ambrosia to 50 people without coconut . I give up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the end of the world . Everybody's giving the Georgia Power Company a merry Christmas . Bet Miss Florine beat them all , especially with the new house . Absurd ! If I had a nose like Florine , I wouldn't say , "" Merry Christmas "" to anybody . I enjoy Christmas at their house . No wonder . You're the only Christian in the place . They got that new cook . Florine never could keep help . Of course , it's none of my affair . Too much running around . The Garden Club this the Junior League that . As if they 'd give her the time of day . She 'd die before she 'd fix a glass of iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood . I hope she doesn't take it into her head to sing this year . Lord have mercy ! Look what Miss Florine done . If her grandfather , old man Frietag , could see this . What is it you say ? I bet he 'd jump out of his grave and snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Miss Daisy , you go on away from here . Wait a minute . This isn't a Christmas present . You know I don't give Christmas presents . I happened to run across it this morning . Well , go on , open it . Look at that . Ain't nobody never gave me no book before . "" Zaner Method Writing . "" I always taught out of these . I saved a few . It's faded , but it works . If you practice , you'll write nicely . But you have to practice . I taught Mayor Hartsfield out of the same book . I sure do thank you . It's not a Christmas present . Jews have no business giving Christmas presents . You don't have to go yapping about this to Boolie or Florine . This is between you and me . Merry Christmas , Mother Werthan . I hope I don't spit up . Merry Christmas , Mama . Hoke . She fought me on this one . But it is time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . No , sir , I don't expect I'll miss it that much . Come on , you're the only one who's driven it all this time . Won't you be a little sorry to see it go ? It ain't going nowhere . I done bought it . You didn't . I sure did . Already made the deal with Mr . Red Mitchell . How much ? That is for him and me to know . Hey , Boolie ! Got a gem here . Got that paper , Hoke ? I got it right here . Be right there . Why didn't you buy it from Mama ? Would have saved money . No , sir . Your mama is in my business enough as it is . I ain't studying about making monthly payments to her . She is mine the regular way . The Hudson's a good car . Nobody knows that better than you . Best that ever come off the line . And this here new one , if Miss Daisy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one . Mighty nice of you . We do what we can . It is three after seven . Yes , Ma'am . You said we were leaving at fifteen to eight . At the latest , I said . What business you got dragging this mess out of the house by yourself ? Who was here to help me ? Lord have mercy ! It don't take more than 5 minutes to load this car . You're fixing to break your arms and your legs before we even leave the manor . You're taking on too much . I hate doing things at the last minute . What you talking about ? Been ready to go for a week and a half . - Give me that package . - No , don't touch that . It sure is pretty . Is that Mr . Walter's present ? Yes . It's fragile . I'll put it on the seat . You nearly missed us . You were leaving at quarter of . - She's taking on . - Be still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it's not a snake ! I think it's notepaper . How appropriate . Uncle Walter can't see . Maybe it's soap . How nice that you take an interest in your uncle's 90th birthday . Don't start up with me , mama I can't go to Mobile with you . I have to go to New York for a convention . The convention starts Monday . And I know what else I know . Leave Florine out of this . She ordered those tickets 8 months ago . I'm sure "" My Fair Lady "" is more important than your relatives . Those Christians will be impressed . I can't talk to you when you're like this . - We're expected in Mobile for supper . - You'll be there . - How will you stand her all day ? - They'll fix crab . All that trouble . She's just worked up . Here's $50 in case you have trouble . Don't show it to Mama ! - Have you got a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It's 7:16 ! You should have a job on the radio announcing the time . - I want to miss rush hour . - You will . Congratulate Uncle Walter for me and kiss everybody in Mobile . The air conditioning did you check it , like I said ? I got the air conditioning checked . I don't know why . You never let me turn it on ! Hush up ! Good luck ! Good God ! Turn left . No , right ! Turn right ! Did I ever tell you about the first time I left Georgia ? When was that ? A few minutes back ! Go on ! My daughter is married to a Pullman porter . She is always on the go . New York , Detroit , St . Lois . I say , "" That's all well and good , Tommie Lee but I don't feel the need for it . "" So here it is . The first time . And I might tell you , Miss Daisy Alabama is not looking like much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff yourself good . I was thinking about the first time I went to Mobile . It was Walter's wedding : 1888 . 1888 ! You were nothing but a little bitty thing . I was 12 . We went on the train . Oh , I was so excited . I 'd never been in a wedding party . I had never seen the ocean . Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico , not the ocean , but it was all the same to me . I asked Papa if it was all right for me to dip my hand in the water . And he laughed because I was so timid . And then I tasted the salt water on my fingers . Isn't that a silly thing to remember ? No sillier than most of what folks remember . Boy ! What are you doing with this car ? This is my car , officer . Can I see your registration , please , and your license , boy . What's this name ? Wertheran ? Werthan . Never heard that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . German derivation . Thank you , ma'am . An old nigger and an old Jew woman riding down the road together . Now that is one sorry sight . Oh , my God ! The sign says Phenix City 30 miles . We're not supposed to go to Phenix City ! Oh , my God ! Maybe you read it wrong . I didn't . Stop the car . Stop the car ! Lord have mercy . Here . You took the wrong turn at Opelika . You took it with me , Miss Daisy . And you got the map . I was getting the lunch ! Go on back . My God ! It ai nt ' more than 30 minutes since we turned . They fixed crab for me . Minnie always fixes crab . They go to so much trouble . It's all ruined by now . We going to have to pull over . What's wrong with the car ? There ain't nothing wrong with the car . I got to be excused . I got to go make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service station . You know colored can't use the toilet at any service station , Miss Daisy . There's no time to stop . We'll be in Mobile soon . You can wait . No , ma'am . - I told you to wait ! - I heard what you said . How do you think I feel having to ask you can I go make water like I am some child . I 'd be ashamed . I ain't no child , Miss Daisy . And I ain't just a back of the neck you look at while you go where you got to go . I am a man . I'm near 70 years old . And I know when my bladder's full . Now I'm going to get out of this car and go over there and do what I got to do . And I'm taking the key with me , too . Now that's all there is to it ! Hoke ! Hoke ! Hoke ? You all right , Miss Daisy ? Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s Boolie . How you doing ? Congratulations on your dad's big day . Thank you , Boolie . Thank you . Aunt Daisy ! It's Boolie on the phone . Hey , son ! Uncle Walter appreciates your call . I don't think he can come to the phone . Fine . How's Hoke ? What do you mean ? How should he be ? Happy birthday , Uncle Walter . I got to hang up now , Boolie . Yeah , I'll tell him . For he's a jolly good fellow . Which nobody can deny ! Morning , Miss McClatchey . Well , good morning to you . Can I see him ? It's Mr . Sinclair Harris , sir . My cousin Sinclair ? His wife ... The one that talk funny . She's from Canton , Ohio . She's trying to hire me . - What ? ! - Yes , sir . She said : "" How they treating you down there , Hoke ? "" You know how she sound , like her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs . Harris , just fine , thank you . "" She said , "" Well , you looking for a change , you know who to call . "" I'll be damned ! I thought you ought to know about it . I'll be goddamned . Ain't she a mess ? Said , "" Name your own salary . "" I see . And did you ? Did I what ? - Name your own salary ? - Go away . What you think I am ? I ain't studying working for no trashy something like her . But she got you thinking , didn't she ? Well , sir , you might say that . Name your salary . That's exactly what she said . Well , how does $65 a week sound ? Sounds pretty good , sir . Course , $75 sounds better . It sure does ! Beginning this week . That's mighty nice of you . I sure appreciate this . Thank you . You ever have folks fighting over you ? No . It sure feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mah jongg . You are the luckiest thing , Beulah ! Excuse me . I don't know how you can look at that . See it a few times , you get in it . Both your brains are fixing to evaporate . You can bring the cake now , Hoke . Don't make a mess with those peas . Do I ever ? Lord have mercy , look at that . Ain't she got a lot of hair ? How she get it so shiny ? Washes it in mayonnaise . - Go on away from here , Idella ! - Yes , she did . I read it in Life magazine . Don't seem human , does it ? He will tear you to shreds ! I am not going into that court . And I'm not giving in ! You are at the end of your rope . You murdered Carlson . You have to pay ! Either choose the easy way out , or you go into the courtroom and let them carve you into pathetic little bits . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? She up to something , ain't she ? - You fixing to ruin it . - What are you talking about ? You got the chicken too close together and the fire is too high . Mind your business . It's your chicken . Thank you , Hoke . Now you enjoy it . Amen . Who is it ? Morning , Miss Daisy . What in the world ... ? I learned how to drive on ice when I delivered milk for the dairy . Ain't nothing to it . Other folks are banging into each other like they're in the funny papers . I figured your stove was out , so I stopped by the Krispy Kreme . I know you got to have coffee in the morning . How sweet of you , Hoke . We ain't had any good coffee around here since Idella passed . I can fix her biscuits . We both can make her fried chicken . But nobody can make Idella's coffee . Ain't that the truth ? Idella was lucky . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'m just going to take these things off . I don't know what you can do here today , except keep me company . Then I'll see if I can make us a fire . Eat anything you want out of the ice box . It will all spoil , anyway . And wipe up what you tracked onto my floor . What do you think I am , a mess ? Mama , I'll be right out when I can get down my own driveway . Stay home , Boolie . Hoke is here with me . How 'd he manage that ? He's very handy . I'm fine . I don't need a thing in the world . Hello ? I have the wrong number . Mama's saying loving things about Hoke . I didn't say I love him . I said he was handy . Honestly ! Are you trying to irritate me in the middle of an ice storm ? Thank you , Wellborn . Thank you all . I am deeply grateful to be chosen 1966 Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor I've seen bestowed on mighty fine fellows . And one I never expected would come to me . I'm afraid that my loss up here and my gain down here have given me an air of competence that I don't possess . I will tell you that I wish my father and grandfather could see this . About 72 years ago , they leased an old mill up on Decatur Road with I believe 25 looms in operation . They managed to grow with Atlanta . And Werthan Industries believes that what we want is what Atlanta wants . And this award proves that we were right . I thank you . Well ? What is it ? What took you so long ? I couldn't help it . There's a big mess up yonder . What's the matter ? I might as well not go to temple at all ! No , ma'am , you ain't going to get to the temple this morning , Miss Daisy . Why not ? What's the matter with you ? Somebody has bombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @'s how come we stuck here so long . I don't believe it ! That's what the policeman just said . Oh , my God . Was anybody there ? Were people hurt ? I don't know . He didn't say . Who would do such a thing ? You know good as me , Miss Daisy . It always be the same one's . I remember one time back down there in Macon . Lord , I couldn't've been more than 10 or 11 years old , I reckon . I had this friend named Porter . One day there his daddy was hanging from a tree . Now just the day before , we 'd all been pitching horseshoes . Laughing and carrying on and talking about how me and Porter was going to have strong right arms , just like him . Lord , there he was . Hanging up yonder in the tree . Had his hand tied behind him . Flies was all over him . I tell you , I threw up where I was standing . You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you tell me that story ? Lord , I don't know , Miss Daisy . That mess back there put me in mind of it . Ridiculous ! The temple has nothing to do with it ! Yes , ma'am , if you say so . We don't know . Maybe that policeman wasn't telling the truth . Why would he go and lie about a thing like that ? You never get things right ! Miss Daisy , somebody done bombed that temple and you know it ! I don't want to hear anymore about it ! - You the boss . - Don't talk to me ! - Where are you ? - Up here ! Hello , Mama . How are you feeling ? Not a good question to ask somebody nearly 90 ! Well , you look fine . It's my ageless appeal ! Miss McClatchey gave me your message . Florine is invited , too . Thank you . I guess Hoke should drive us . There'll be a crowd . Mama , we have to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . I believe Martin Luther King has done some mighty fine things . If you don't want to go , why don't you just say so ? I want to go ! You know how I feel about him . Of course , but Florine ... Florine has nothing to do with it . I still have to do business here . I see . Werthan Bag will go out of business if you attend the King dinner . Not exactly . But a lot of men I do business with would not like it ! They might snicker a little . Call me Martin Luther Werthan behind my back . Maybe I wouldn't hear about meetings at the Club . Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills , he's a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew . All the really smart one's come from New York , don't they ? Some might throw their business to Jack instead of old Martin Luther Werthan . I don't know . Maybe it wouldn't happen . And sometimes that's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seats , somebody else will . If we do not use those seats ? I'm not supposed to go , either ? You can do whatever you want . Thanks for your permission . Can I ask you something ? When did you get so fired up about Martin Luther King ? Why , Boolie ! I've never been prejudiced in my life and you know it . Then ask Hoke to go with you . Don't be ridiculous . He wouldn't go . Ask him and see . All right ! Boolie said the silliest thing the other day . What did he say ? He was talking about Martin Luther Ling . I guess you know him , don't you ? King ? No , ma'am . I don't know him . I was sure you did . But you've heard him preach ? Yes , Ma'am , same way you have . On the TV . I think he's wonderful . - What you getting at ? - It's so silly . Boolie says you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that ? No , I didn't . I didn't think so . What 'd be the point ? You can hear him whenever you want . I think it's wonderful the way things are changing . Now what you think I am , Miss Daisy ? What do you mean ? The invitation to this dinner came in the mail a month ago . Now , if did be you wanted me to go with you how come you wait ' till we in the car on the way before you asked me ? What ? All I said was Boolie said you wanted to go . Next time you want me to go somewhere ask me regular . You don't have to carry on so much . Let's just leave it alone . Honestly ! Talk about things changing . They ain't changed all that much . I'll help you . Thank you , Hoke , I can help myself . ... can see that the South has marvelous possibilities . Yet in spite of these assets segregation has placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . Yet there are in the white South millions of people of good will whose voices are yet unheard whose course is yet unclear and whose courageous acts are yet unseen . These millions are called upon to gird their courage , to speak out to offer leadership that is needed . History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people . And our generation will have to repent not only for the words and acts of the children of darkness but also for the fears and apathy of the children of light . Morning , Miss Daisy . Miss Daisy ? Hoke , is that Hoke ? It's me . You all right ? Hoke , what did I do with my papers ? My papers ! I had them all corrected last night and I put them where I wouldn't forget them on my way to school . What did you do with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed if I don't give them their homework . I always give it back the next day . That's why they like me . You talking out your head . Why aren't you helping me ? What'll I do ? Find those papers . I told you . It's all right if you moved them . I won't be mad . But I've got to get to school . I'll be late . Who will take care of my class ? They'll be all alone . Oh , God ! I do everything wrong ! Now set down in here . You're going to fall and hurt yourself . I'm so sorry . It's all my fault . I didn't do right . It's so awful ! Ain't nothing awful except the way you carrying on . It's all my fault . I can't find the papers . The children are waiting . There ain't nobody waiting on you . You ain't a teacher . It doesn't make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ! You don't know . This Hoke here . What can I do for you ? It's your mama . What's wrong ? She's taking on something awful . Why's today different from any other day ? No , sir . It's not the same . I'll be right there . Miss Daisy , now there ain't nothing wrong with you ! Your mind done took a turn this morning . You'll snap back if you let yourself . I can't ! I can't ! You're a lucky old woman . No ! It's all a mess now , and I can't do anything about it . Now look at you . You rich , you well for your time . You got folks who care what happens to you . I am being trouble . I don't want to be trouble to anybody . You want something to cry about , I'll run you to the state home let you see what's laying out there . I bet there ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I'm sorry . I'm so sorry . Those poor children . You keep this up and Mr . Werthan's going to call that doctor on you . Just as sure as you born , that doctor is going to have you out in that asylum . Now is that the way you want it to be ? Do you still have that Hudson ? You talking about from when I first come here ? No , Miss Daisy . That thing been in the junkyard now ... more than 15 years . I'm driving your next to last car now . 1965 Cadillac . It's running fine as wine , too . You ought not to be driving anything the way you see . Now , how you know how I can see ' less'n you can look out my eyes . You're my best friend . - Go on now , Miss Daisy . - No , really . You are . You are . Well , Hoke , good to see you ! - You didn't drive yourself here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My granddaughter drove me . My Lord , is she old enough to drive ? Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now . She's teaching biology at yonder Spelman College . I never knew that . Seems mighty funny to sell the house while Mama's still alive . Yes , sir , I imagine it do . But she hasn't been inside the door for two years . I know . I suppose you don't see her very much . No , sir , I don't . It's hard , not driving , Mr . Werthan . There's no bus that goes out yonder . Course , I take a taxicab as often as I can . I ' m sure she appreciates it . Some days she's better than others . But then , who ain't ? Happy Thanksgiving , Mama ! Look who I brought ! Morning , Miss Daisy . You been keeping yourself busy ? She certainly has . She goes to jewelry making ... How many times a week ? She makes all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular Tiffany's . Isn't that something ! Are you all right , Mama ? Hoke , I thought of you the other day . - I saw an Avondale milk truck . - Is that right ? A big monster of a thing . Must've had 16 wheels . Go on away from here . I wondered how you 'd have liked driving that around . Hoke came to see me , not you . This is one of her good days . Mama , Florine said to wish you a happy Thanksgiving . She's in Washington . She's a Republican National Committeewoman now . Good God ! Go charm the nurses ! She wants you all to herself . You are a doodle , Mama . Boolie paying you still ? Every week . How much ? Now that's between him and me . Highway robbery ! It sure is . It sure is . How are you ? I'm doing the best I can . Me , too . Well , that's about all there is to it then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie .
